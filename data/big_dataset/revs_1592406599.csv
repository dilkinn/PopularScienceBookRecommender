0,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,4,"Turns out everyone thinks they are somehow smarter than the people around them, everyone. We all are guilty of it. We walk into a Wal-mart, take a look around us and think “what a bunch of freaks, and always in Wal-mart” …..But we are also in Wal-mart as we make this judgment. I don’t go into that store unless they are the only option, but every time I look around and I think to myself “do I also look like a freak by just entering this store, then magically go back to normal when I leave?”I once thought that I had free will and nothing that Sam Harris wrote proved otherwise, but David McRaney may have done just that. Nothing we do as humans have anything to do with individual choice. We are all manipulated by the media and a bunch of biases and fallacies.Here are a couple of examples of this…….“Confirmation BiasThe Misconception: Your opinions are the result of years of rational, objective analysis.The Truth: Your opinions are the result of years of paying attention to information which confirmed what you believed while ignoring information which challenged your preconceived notions.”So, this wasn’t news to me. I am not ever going to watch Faux News for any reason, unless I had a job that forced me to do it. Skeeter, down the street would rather eat an arugula salad before watching Rachel Maddow for ten seconds. We are only going to pay attention to the things that confirm our beliefs……this explains the existents of Rush Limbaugh. That being said, I’m right and Skeeter is not. “Extinction BurstThe Misconception: If you stop engaging in a bad habit, the habit will gradually diminish until it disappears from your life.The Truth: Any time you quit something cold turkey, your brain will make a last-ditch effort to return you to your habit.”Yeah, anyone who has dieted (most probably everyone, unless you are one of those skinny people who “just can’t seem to gain weight”…..everyone hates you) has experienced this. You are going along well, you are hitting your goals….you hit a plateau or life gets in the way and you break from the diet a little. Before you know it you are back to eating the stuff you really shouldn’t. This is due to the ‘extinction burst’. Food tastes good, some food tastes better than others and since we evolved to survive we are hard wired to crave high calorie food because that is what determined life or death. Ironically, that’s what’s killing us today. When a reward is taken away from us, we throw a fit…….but if we still don’t get the reward we give up. That’s why you never give in to a two year old during an extinction burst.“The Just-World FallacyThe Misconception: People who are losing at the game of life must have done something to deserve it.The Truth: The beneficiaries of good fortune often do nothing to earn it, and bad people often get away with their actions without consequences”This is a big one. All those people who believe that poor people are poor because they want to be and/or are not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps because they just want to live easy off the system and have no idea how to work hard, these people are fooled by this fallacy. Never, do they take into account their own fortunate beginnings as the reason they themselves are not amongst the poor. The reason they are not poor is not only because they worked really hard (I’m not saying they didn’t work hard, and that is a big part of sucess), but they are not poor because they didn’t come from poor most likely. Many people have risen above their poor beginnings (Ben Franklin) but it’s a very hard cycle to overcome. Those who have a hard time overcoming this may have this fallacy to blame……“Learned HelplessnessThe Misconception: If you are in a bad situation, you will do whatever you can do to escape it.The Truth: If you feel like you aren’t in control of your destiny, you will give up and accept whatever situation you are in.”This is all about having some control in your life. If all choice is taken away from a person they tend to give up. Residents in nursing homes do better if they get to choose how to arrange their furniture than those who have everything done for them. If you are living in a bad situation and you don’t have any control over what happens to you, you don’t have access to higher education because it is financially out of reach. No one will give you a job no matter how hard you try because you aren’t dressed nice enough, and you don’t have enough education…….these people will accept their situation most likely than not.This book was very interesting. But I’m feeling a little down because I learned that I am not so smart and I am not that special.Thanks David for the depression…..*sigh*All kidding aside, I really enjoyed this book. Here’s a website if you would like to read more.You are not so smart. As seen on Shelfinflicted "
1,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8341353-kent,2,"I love Radiolab. It is the best thing. Here are the episodes that you should listen to instead of reading this book:Deception - http://www.radiolab.org/2008/mar/10/Memory and Forgetting - http://www.radiolab.org/2007/jun/07/Placebo - http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/17/Morality - http://www.radiolab.org/2007/aug/13/Stress - http://www.radiolab.org/2007/apr/09/Choice - http://www.radiolab.org/2008/nov/17/Also the other ones. Mmmmm Radiolab.The good thing about YANSS:WYHTMFOFWYMISFA46OWYDY, as I like to abbreviate it, is the sheer accretion of self-delusions. There are a lot of them, and McRaney presents a compelling case that we are profoundly self-delusional creatures.The bad thing about YANSS:WYHTMFOFWYMISFA46OWYDY is the storytelling. This book is little more than a long list of studies. Plus, if you've ever studied Psychology at all (or listened to Radiolab. Did I mention that you should listen to Radiolab?), most of this will already be familiar to you. One trap that McRaney didn't mention is the one that he consistently falls into: confusing correlation with causality. Very few of the studies that this book describes establish causality. As such, many, if not most of the conclusions that the book derives are simply not rigorous. This foray into pop-science has proven unsatisfying. I'm not sure yet if I dislike the genre or if this was just a bad example. "
2,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"This great work boils down to: ""Despite millions of years of evolution your brain is a jumbled mess of neurons that covers up it's downfalls by lying to you constantly. Here are just 46 ways your brain is being an asshole.""Just like Dawkins argues against a creator in showing that evolutionary adaptations can be flawed and seemingly badly designed, David McRaney shows in this work that despite those claims that the human mind is one of the most complex structures in the known universe, it's shoddily put together, with bits that don't work together and bits that were added on at the last minute and that the only way it 'works' is that it constantly lies to itself about the reality it exists in. You have in your head a used car salesman.David demonstrates the limitations of our brains by picking out these 46 different ways our brain lies to us and writing a small chapter on each. Each lie is well researched and refers to different published studies for evidence. For example the chapter on why you have too many Facebook friends talks about studies about the limitations of how many people you can hold in a social circle in the physical world and compares these figures to the data on Facebook. He also talks about the reason why you 'befriend' all those people using the internet.Most interesting are the chapters that highlight the limitations in vision and the comprehension of sensory input. You are not a little person in a box watching a ultra high definition surround sound movie of your existence. More like your homonculus watches a scratchy silent movie from 1908 with no sound and missing film cells, a friend tells them about the soundtrack over the phone.There are also great chapters on how you think you are better than everyone else out there. He actually gives statistics on how many people think they are better than average drivers and how many people think they have a better than average IQ. The figures will astound you.I highly recommend this fun and enlightening read. It certainly will make you question everything you think and perceive, which is a practice that all science endorses strongly. This book is so much more than your average pop-psychology book that litters the popular science section of bookshops and libraries. It holds no punches and approaches the subject from a critical standpoint. Weeks after reading this book I'm still laughing at my brain when I know it's lying to me."
3,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11284372-terri-timonen,1,"Readers Beware!!! NEVER believe a book that presents ""all-or-nothing"" concepts as absolute truth!! And that's exactly what David McRaney's book attempts to do. Each chapter identifies a ""Misconception"" and a ""Truth"" attempting to persuade the reader to believe ""The Truth"" as the author sees it...biased and supported with biased, shallow research. What the author fails to do is provide evidence to the contrary. He presents a very subjective, one-sided argument in favor of his beliefs on a variety of so-called ""myths"" and ""facts"".For example, one chapter titled ""The Bystander Effect"" states this misconception When someone is hurt, people rush to their aid and the truth as The more people who witness a person in distress, the less likely it is that any one person will help. The author defines this ""truth"" even more simply: ""I could help them, but I'm sure someone else will come along."" Followed by ""Everyone thinks that. And no one stops.Is David McRaney for real?! True, this phenomenon has been researched and proven to be credible among social psychologists, BUT it is NOT an all-inclusive/exclusive ""doctrinal truth"" for the entire human population. David McRaney chooses not include the ""rest of the story"". He lists only specific, well-known events that prove his point. But what about the population of people that have stepped in to help someone who was hurt? Where are those studies? Non-existent? Maybe. Why? Because they are incidental. You might hear about some altruistic stranger who came to someone's rescue on the evening news every now and then, but that's about it.I have personally experienced a few ""emergency"" situations among a crowd and the Bystander Effect was never the case. Sweeping conclusions that present outcomes as either black or white are very dangerous. This author is irresponsible at best and deceptive at worst. I will concede that some of the chapters do provide ""food for thought"", especially The Straw Man Fallacy which addresses how we attempt to win an argument by re-framing our opponent's position (i.e.making it personal, etc.). The only conclusion one can glean from this book is that the ""misconceptions"" and ""truths"" David McRaney identifies are unprovable. Circumstantial. Biased. To lump the behavior of the majority of the human population into these ""boxed"" fallacies is insulting.If you're a free-thinker, creative problem-solver, or desire to see the whole picture beyond ""the elephant's trunk"", then this book will most likely be a waste of time...unless of course anger spurs you to action. In that case, I would make it a case study."
4,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-clumsy-storyteller,4,"We have endless internal dialogues that assist with interpretation of information and decision-making based on what we know , feel , and think it's right but the truth is we are all delusional ... somehow ! All of us think we’re smarter than everyone else , just like we believe that we’re better looking, funnier, more attractive and more likeable and more generally competent than everyone else. Of course we’re not , we are naturally hindered into thinking in certain ways and not others, and the world around us is the product of dealing with these biases, not overcoming them. The three main subjects in this book are cognitive biases, heuristics, and logical fallacies. These are components of your mind  Cognitive biases: cognitive biases are predicable patterns of thought and behavior that lead you to draw incorrect conclusions, You and everyone else come into the world preloaded with these pesky and completely wrong ways of seeing things, and you rarely notice them. Many of them serve to keep you confident in your own perceptions or to inhibit you from seeing yourself as a buffoon. The maintenance of a positive self-image seems to be so important to the human mind you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself. We tend to like people who think like us. If we agree with someone’s beliefs, we’re more likely to be friends with them. While this makes sense, it means that we subconsciously begin to ignore or dismiss anything that threatens our world views, since we surround ourselves with people and information that confirm what we already think. For example : Hindsight BiasTHE MISCONCEPTION: After you learn something new, you remember how you were once ignorant or wrong.THE TRUTH: You often look back on the things you’ve just learned and assume you knew them or believed them all along ""I KNEW IT"" !!! You tend to edit your memories so you don’t seem like such a dimwit when things happen you couldn’t have predicted. When you learn things you wish you had known all along, you go ahead and assume you did know them. This tendency is just part of being a person, and it is called the Hindsight Bias. another example : IntrospectionTHE MISCONCEPTION: You know why you like the things you like and feel the way you feel.THE TRUTH: The origin of certain emotional states is unavailable to you, and when pressed to explain them, you will just make something up.You think you know why you like what you like but if someone asks you : Why you like that book or painting or music? according to research, your explanation is probably going to be total bullshit , when you are faced with a decision in which you are forced to think about your rationale, you start to turn the volume in your emotional brain down and the volume in your logical brain up. You start creating a mental list of pros and cons that would never have been conjured up if you had gone with your gut. As Wilson noted in his research, “Forming preferences is akin to riding a bicycle; we can do it easily but cannot easily explain how.” heuristics : Heuristics are mental shortcuts you use to solve common problems. They speed up processing in the brain, but sometimes make you think so fast you miss what is important. Instead of taking the long way around and deeply contemplating the best course of action or the most logical train of thought, you use heuristics to arrive at a conclusion in record time. Some heuristics are learned, and others come free with every copy of the human brain. When they work, they help your mind stay frugal. When they don’t, you see the world as a much simpler place than it really is logical fallacies:Logical fallacies are like math problems involving language, in which you skip a step or get turned around without realizing it. They are arguments in your mind where you reach a conclusion without all the facts because you don’t care to hear them or have no idea how limited your information is. You become a bumbling detective. Logical fallacies can also be the result of wishful thinking. Sometimes you apply good logic to false premises; at other times you apply bad logic to the truth. For instance, if you hear Albert Einstein refused to eat scrambled eggs, you might assume scrambled eggs are probably bad for you. This is called the argument from authority. You assume if someone is super-smart, then all of that person’s decisions must be good ones, but maybe Einstein just had peculiar taste.With each new subject in this book you will start to see yourself in a new way. The more you try to analyze it the more you hurt your brain :'( "
5,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This is a fun, pop-psychology book that kept me interested from beginning to end. It is arranged into 48 chapters, each devoted to a different misconception that we are all subject to. Some of these misconceptions have technical names that will be unfamiliar to most people. For example, I never heard of ""apophenia"", which is the idea that coincidences are so miraculous, they must have meaning. The ""truth"" is that ""Coincidences are a routine part of life, even the seemingly miraculous ones. Any meaning applied to them comes from your mind.""Another misconception is ""Brand Loyalty"". This is the idea that you prefer the things you own over those you don't, because of rational choices you made. The truth is that you prefer things that you own, because ""you rationalize your past choices to protect your sense of self"". Retailers understand this misconception, and try to prevent you from suffering from ""buyer's remorse."" The ""expectation"" misconception is a classic. Wine experts can be fooled by altering their expectations. Experiments have shown that putting wines into bottles with cheap or expensive labels can alter the expectations of wine drinkers and experts alike, thus changing their opinions of wine quality. Some manufacturers put high prices on their products in order to persuade consumers of their high quality. I think of this, when I see high-priced headphones of certain brands.Many of the misconceptions are described in terms of classic psychology experiments. They are all fun to read, and made me laugh (at myself). The only problem is that I've read about most of these experiments in other books. That is the problem with pop psychology books--after a while, they repeat the very same material over and over.I do wish the book had an index. Here I am trying to remember where I read various anecdotes and experiments, and I am at a loss as to where to find them. Many of the chapters reiterate, ""You are not so smart"". So, the tone of the book might rub some readers the wrong way. But I felt like it was just written that way to add a bit of humor, not to be condescending."

I also like to think that I am in complete control of such things as my thoughts, opinions, and buying power. But, evidently, I am not so smart.I like the color red. I also like to think that I know exactly why I like the color red. But, David McRaney says that I am not so smart.I like to think that I am a good person who would rush to the help of others in an emergency. I also like to think that I can think quickly on my feet and would know exactly what to do in such an emergency. But the book I just read tells me that I am not so smart. (Sometimes I like to think that I would have no idea what to do in an emergency. Just so we're clear that at least sometimes I'm smart. Maybe.)I like having friends. I also like having Facebook friends. I like having more than 150 Facebook friends. But apparently, I am not smart enough to have more than that. You know--because I AM NOT SO SMART.I could go on, but I will spare you, and let you read about it for yourself in David McRaney's new book You Are Not So Smart (though I bet you were smart enough to figure out that that was the title already) which is based on his popular blog by the same name (that I wasn't smart enough to hear about before now, but have now read daily since).McRaney has taken his blog and moved it to book format with small, blog-sized chapters which announce a misconception (when you are around others, you feel as if everyone is noticing every aspect of your appearance and behavior) and a reality (people devote little attention to you unless prompted to). McRaney then uses psychological studies and examples to explain the misconception du jour and help us all understand exactly how not smart we are.Fascinating stuff, people. I really enjoyed reading it. It's the kind of stuff that I can really eat up because it is just so interesting.That said, I found myself being just the teensyist bit angry at the lack of control I have in my life. Everything around me is apparently manipulating my thoughts and views and I am so unaware of it that I make up lies and reasons to explain my actions. I also don't like how psychology and the brain are the everything. Some of the studies and misconceptions/truths don't match up with my religious views. Especially my beliefs that God answers prayers and that the Holy Ghost can lead and guide us through personal revelation. I'm sure that my brain does play a part in that, but I don't think it's ALL my brain.But then, I am not so smart. "
8,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,"We think we're really smart, that we are much better than the stupid people around us, but in reality, our brains take shortcuts to make situations easier for us to handle. This book divulges 48 ways that show we aren't really all that smart.This isn't so much a full review as just my brief impressions. Which are, in one word: WOW! This book was incredible to read! I spent an entire 2+ hour flight reading this, unable to put it down and read my fiction books!Some of these examples I had heard of before (such as the Invisible Gorilla experiment and how we rewrite our memories). Others just astounded me, such as how our brains can't really hold more than about 150 people or the many ways we are bad at statistics (Affect Heuristic, Illusion of Control, etc.). I thought it was particularly clever how McRaney made sure in each section to say ""you are not so smart"" at least once; it never came off repetitive or condescending.About the only complaint I have is how some of these 48 examples overlap, such as with Aprophenia and Consistency Bias. It was sometimes difficult to differentiate the differences or, I should say, understand why the author split the two items apart instead of tie them together. It did kinda irk me that the Just-World Fallacy was the explanation for blaming a woman's rape on her dress or going out at night. Sure, some of it may contribute, but I doubt that victim blaming can be 100% attributed to our brains misfiring like this. Also, the book hints that men and women think differently; I still think that society has something to do with that.But really, don't take these complaints too much to heart (they are VERY mild and barely mentioned). It's a fascinating look at our brains, how we think, and how we can try to overcome some of these fallacies to be more rounded individuals. Highly recommended!"
9,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"I enjoyed this book immensely and I found that I could identify many of my own flaws laid bare in these pages. Mr McRaney explains how we have been hardwired to act in certain ways ever since we swung down from the trees and elaborates on how these vestigial impulses and instincts affect how we act and think today. Want to know why you overeat or why you procrastinate? It's all right here.I think the book is very well organized. McRaney touches on so many topics pertaining to our thoughts and actions that to go in depth on each topic he would have had to write fifty thick books. How many ponderous volumes have been written strictly on memory, for example? He has handled the problem perfectly, providing enough information to give a broad understanding of each topic and then moving on to the next chapter. This has the benefit of providing information without bogging the reader down in extraneous detail.Sadly, although I finished the book very recently, I don't remember a lot of it...but then, I also can't remember why I originally walked into this room. One thing for sure, I'll be buying a copy of this brilliant publication because I'll be reading it again."
10,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,5,"This awesome read evidences basic theories to a lot more complicated, the obvious to those you never would believe until you read the data.... but the difference being that the writer backs that up with really good data and/or studies. Some of the ""theories""/""ways"" you already know like the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, normalcy bias, the Dunning-Kruger effect, brand loyalty, the ad hominem fallacy, groupthink, hindsight bias, The anchoring affect, the illusion of transparency, Cognitive Bias, The Fundamental Attribution Error.... There are 48 reasons you are not so smart.... A lot of it also is stuff you knew but didn't know how to label. Which also assists in making you understand it more ""insightfully"", with less denial. Reviews say this had the right amount of uncomfortable truth (something along those lines), but I disagree. It was more. More than was comfortable. But none of us want to admit to ourselves that we lie to ourselves, do we? So, yes, pretend this was a scholarly read with a ""right"" amount of truth, when the truth is, for all of us, it was too much. And we will, the best of us anyways, accept that; understand that as individuals this is the inevitable way for our surviving, and after hating the author for bringing us out of our denial momentarily, lie to ourselves that, no, of course we welcome the truth, thus having to not hate Sir McRaney. Then we will subsequently reshelf this. And go back to our lives of unavoidable lying to ourselves. But, with all our new information, data, evidence, insight filed away, although we will never be one hundred percent honest with ourselves, we can be a little more aware so as to reduce it a little to better the daily interactions, relationships, etcetera in our lives."
11,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"A quick, informal view of cognitive biases, behaviors, & other glitches that keep us from being the rational beings we believe we are. Each chapter is brief explanation of what brain glitch is being covered. I knew most of them, but found even those chapters interesting as he gives very good examples. It's interesting how & why many of these evolved plus how they're playing out in modern society. Many are used to trick us by advertising, political candidates, & others. Many of these are necessary to even function, but have disastrous consequences when out of hand. Others are just a pain that we have to watch for.The introduction describes the reason for these. We evolved in a completely different environment that we have created for ourselves now. Snap judgments & prejudices that once saved our lives are now causing issues. The primitive, emotional parts of our brains often come to conclusions that we can't articulate. Sometimes we're influenced by them, other times we can override them, but it can lead to dissonances. Of course, hormones & unconscious senses can factor in. It's amazing we're as rational as we are, which isn't very.Many of these were drawn directly from his website/blog which is here:https://youarenotsosmart.com/I'll list the table of contents with a brief explanation. Many are actual psychological terms, but some aren't.Priming - environmental factors causing decisions. The smell of freshly baked bread or cookies can make a house more attractive for sale.Confabulation - we make up reasons if we don't know one. Our emotional brain decides, we act. Why? Ask us & we'll tell you even though we don't know.Confirmation bias - If it agrees with our beliefs, it is given more weight than if it disagrees.Hindsight bias - I knew that! Rewriting ourselves to bolster our self esteem.The Texas sharpshooter fallacy - painting the bulls eye after the shots for the best effect.Procrastination - we really should vs. we want.Normalcy bias - this can't be happening!Introspection - thinking about thinking, judging our own knowledge. Again, self esteem makes us think better of ourselves.The availability heuristic -easily recalled given more weight than less well known. News tells us of more disasters, we believe more are happening, even if they're not.The bystander effect - someone else will do it/no one else is so why should I? Being part of the herd is important.The Dunning-Kruger effect - I am smarter/better/prettier than I really am, another aspect of bolstering the self esteem.Apophenia - seeing connections & meaning where none exists. Bad statistical & probability analysis. Part of our egocentric point of view.Brand loyalty - investment bias. I invested therefore rationalization of better qualities, minimize problems. Similar to or elements of confirmation bias.The argument from authority - famous or well educated in one area carrying weight in another where they are no better informed than anyone else.The argument from ignorance - very similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect, the more you the less certain you are.The straw Man Fallacy - shifting the point to a limited fantasy figure & changing it to more easily refute.The ad hominem fallacy - shifting the point from the issue to the speaker's status.The just-world fallacy - belief in Karma
The public goods game
 - self interest run rampant? Sort of.The ultimatum game - status/fairness trumps rationality, similar to previous.Subjective validation - if it pertains to me, it is more likely correct. Astrology couldn't exist without it. We tend to notice what fits us & disregard that which doesn't.Cult indoctrination - belief in a person or ideology as a whole, tendency to discount the bad.Groupthink - fitting in, not making waves, even when really dumb. Bay of Pigs. Every group needs a Devil's Advocate or, as he puts it, a disagreeing asshole.Supernormal releasers - existing response tendency magnified. Junk food, Barbie dolls (7:10 waist hips ratio healthy, 5:10 super sexy, even if not healthy), beetles loving beer bottles.The affect heuristic - snap judgement of good-bad based on initial, often subconscious impressions. An emotional response that is tough to overcome. (Instant dislike/love.)Dunbar's number - 150 is about the max for social connections.Selling out - everyone does. It's what keeps the economy growing.Self-serving bias - maintain & enhance self-esteem by favoring self in self narrative.The spotlight effect - belief we are noticed more than we are.The third person effect - mass media affects you more than me, so I must limit the incorrect info you receive.Catharsis - full of anger? Punch a bag & let it out! Except it turns out that doesn't work so well.The misinformation effect it's far too easy to misremember something when told something else happened. Watch a robbery, look at a line up. If told that the suspect is there, too many people will find him even if he isn't.Conformity - fitting into the tribe is super important.Extinction burst - why so many diets fail. Any time you quit something cold turkey, your brain will make a last-ditch effort to return you to your old ways.Social loafing in a group, everyone slacks off some.The illusion of transparency belief that others can see what you are thinking & feeling.Learned helplessness after too many failures, animals just quit trying in the same situation.Embodied cognition- the brain, while important, is not the only resource we have available to us to generate behavior.The anchoring effect relying too heavily on the first piece of info no matter its actual veracity or relevance. If the sale price is 1/2 the normal price, it must be a good deal. Used by Harbor Freight & Northern Tool constantly!Attention - We don't pay attention to everything evenly & that varies by culture. Tunnel vision is amazing, can even miss the gorilla in the room, literally.Self-handicapping - expecting less of ourselves so that failure doesn't hurt as bad.Self-fulfilling prophecies - Meet someone, categorize them as an ass & they behave like one. Many times the reason is the way you react to them, so they fulfill what you expect.The moment - something I'd been waiting for & had expected to hear about in other contexts. We are not one person, but multiple people, especially the ""Now"" person (a few seconds to about 3 minutes when memories are either dropped or put into long term memory) & the ""Remembered"" self (which has little time sense, although he doesn't mention that) which is the narrative self. Happiness is based on satisfying both of these selves. I believe this is also part of the Peak-end rule where we tend to remember averages & endings.Consistency bias not remembering how we really were/thought/acted, but framing it in how we would today.The representativeness heuristic again, we're bad at probability. We instinctively believe tails will come up if 6 heads have already appeared, but the probability is still 1 in 2.Expectation belief that experts can't be fooled. They can as many wine tasters & art critics have found out.The illusion of control we have very little even over our bodies much less outside them.The fundamental attribution error believing that other people's behavior, especially bad, is due to personality flaws not environmental factors. Wikipedia also has a good list of memory biases here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...Well worth the time to listen to & a lot of fun."
12,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5037788-amber-koppenhofer,3,"Sometimes first impressions are the right ones. Below in italics is my original impression of the book after reading the intro:I've just picked this book up from the library and have only read the introduction, written by the author, who briefly explained why we, as a society, are generally stupid, and how each of us has an internal dialogue that convinces we are much smarter than we are. So, I can't help but wonder what makes this guy think he's one of the rare truly intelligent humans beings who seemingly has enough authority to write a book telling the rest of us how stupid we are. Is he going to explore the fact that it's possible he just thinks he's smart enough to write this book, and that it's perhaps just his internal dialogue telling him that the majority of society is stupid in order to make himself think he is much smarter than he really is? Hmmm... it will be interesting to see where this book goes. As with most informational books, I will probably piddle through this as I feel motivated to read it.Now that I'm done with it, after spending months piddling through this book (as I thought I would), reading a chapter here, two chapters there, putting down for a week or a month, and picking it back up again, I have decided that while I do like this book, and do think it is informative, I have also found that my original thoughts on my book remain nearly the same....No matter what way you spin it, according to this book, we are all a bunch of dumb asses. The author, McRaney, reviews 48 different heuristics (mental short cuts) and cites psychological studies to inform us that none of us really think for ourselves, that it is our environment that influences our thoughts and behaviors, that we don't know when we are lying to ourselves, that we only pay attention to the information we believe in and ignore the rest, that we don't understand why we like what we like, that are memories our mostly fiction, and that we have an internal dialogue that convinces us that all this stuff that happens in our head is real, even when it's not. You can try to convince yourself you don't fit most of these descriptions, but then McRaney serves up the self-serving bias to refute that idea. Basically we are all egotistical, whimsical dim wits walking blindly through this world, making more of coincidences than we should and constantly living in an unconscious state of our own fictionalized worlds. No one is self aware, except of course for those conducting the studies and the author of this book. However, I cannot deny that I see a lot of truth what McRaney reveals, I just think that he and the psychologists cited in these studies forget that some of the conclusions they are drawing can come from their own heuristics. Interesting stuff, nonetheless."

14,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14557882-sean-m,5,"Someone once said, ""It is far easier to entertain than it is to educate."" What McRaney pulls off with shocking ease, in this book, is that rare combination of educational material that is extremely entertaining. What's the difference between this pop psychology book and most of the others out there? The others are relatively boring. The others speak in a professorial manner to prove expertise. McRaney cites studies to bring his points home, but he rarely belabors points. He also explains the complex in a simple, understandable, and entertaining fashion. Some of the other pop psychology books go for entertaining, simple, and understandable, but they do so by titillating you in a base manner. McRaney, to my mind, makes a perfect cut between the two in that it's simple without being base and intellectual without being too professorial. He takes real life situations, places you in them, gives you what you think your reaction would be to them, and explains to you why you won't react in the manner you think you will. He explains why you're not as self-aware, or as smart, as you think you are. The best chapter is the normalcy bias chapter. Check out McRaney's blog, read a few of the chapters he provides there, and buy the book to get the full breadth of this book's brilliance. The only complaint I have is that I can't find any similar books that reach the levels this one has. Mr. McRaney has turned me into an addict for such writing, and everyone else simply falls short. "

We want this sh*t to go mainstream in a serious way.In terms of presentation, McRaney's breviary of mental hygiene often reads like a compilation of practical jokes concocted by research psychologists to bring our colossal inborn stupidity to light.

Essentially, humans think they're pretty smart. But in fact, we easily mislead ourselves into thinking we have a greater grasp of our reality than we actually do.Some parts were a bit repetitive and could have been combined with other chapters of a very similar nature; other parts reinforced studies I've come across in other books. The format really appealed to me - bitesize chunks and easy to read. Some things I learned:- Over a few chapters, McRaney argues that our memories are susceptible to manipulation, and that each time we recall a memory, we essentially build it anew. We do not look back at memories like they are video recordings. Thus, eyewitness accounts can often be inaccurate, as we only perceive a small amount of the information around us, often miss major details, and can be influenced by other accounts we hear of the same event. We confabulate and subconsciously lie to ourselves about why we feel or act a certain way.- Our subconscious behaviour can be easily manipulated by subliminal information, but only if we're unaware of it.- We procrastinate because the amount of effort involved in a task (metacognition, thinking about thinking) is too overwhelming for us to face; instead, we delay the inevitable in lieu of instant gratification.- If faced with a natural disaster like a torpedo or earthquake, there is a good chance that you will shut down and fail to mobilise.- We don't know why we like the things we do, and if we try to think of reasons why, we will often go with what sounds plausible and convince ourselves of that reason, and may even change our initial choice of what we like. This is because we like with the emotional brain but have to describe it with our rational one.- If there are multiple people around when a person is in distress, it is much less likely for someone to help said person-in-need because we think that eventually someone else will step up (the bystander effect).- Zero-sum doesn't make sense even though our sense of status/justice means that we would rather ourselves and others get nothing than everyone get something, if one person is to unfairly get more of the share.- It is only physically possible to maintain a relationship with *roughly* 150 people at once (Dunbar's number).- People don't care if you have a huge spot on your forehead. They probably won't even notice so stop obsessing over yourself.- If you 'let it go' and vent your anger, you will likely increase in aggressive behaviour.There are plenty of other examples, but I'll leave it there!I can imagine some readers will dislike this book because of their arrogance and they think that it doesn't apply to them. Maybe some chapters won't, but other chapters certainly will. Recognising our limitations is one step to working towards rectifying them. Approach this book with humility and maybe it will benefit you."

Why oh why do I get suckered into pop psychology again and again?This book started out as a blog and maybe it should have stayed that way. It seems like great material for a blog and I've actually started following it in my RSS reader. But a published book? Not so much...Mostly the delivery rubbed me the wrong way. My first thought about this book was, ""Wow, so there really IS a reason English teachers tell you not to write in the second person--it is SUPER annoying."" An article or blog post at a time isn't so bad, but when we're talking book-length... Also, for a ""self-described psychology nerd,"" someone who spends a great deal of time and I would assume effort learning about this subject, it seemed like he didn't have all that much respect for the material. For example: ""You should always be the first person to break away from the pack and offer help--or attempt escape--because you can be certain no one else will.""Ahh yes...SCIENCE!!Should. Always. Certain. No one else. It's even more annoying because the data he JUST cited refutes this statement. He does things like this a few times--make statements that are contradicted by things he JUST CITED. When I took this complaint to Peter, he said that that sort of writing ""appeals to the masses"" with its ""accessibility factor."" Well. He just might have a point. But I was still LKSKDfjsdlfasdDSFing about it.In another example, he talks about Littlewood's Law, stating ""He said the average person is alert for about eight hours every day, and something happens to the average person about once a second."" O OK. I guess that clears everything up then. ?!?! I suppose you could be more vague if you tried...but you would have to try hard. Please, author, define ""something."" Without even the attempt to tell us what ""something"" means in this context, the sentence is worthless. Do sounds a person hears count as ""something"" that ""happens"" to them? Words they see? The effect of gravity on their body? The feeling of their socks on their feet? The fact that their cells are metabolizing? Thoughts drifting through their head? The bombardment of UV rays? You can make the argument that billions of things are happening to a person every second, but you gotta set up some kind of definition, some loose parameter of what this ""something"" that is happening to ""the average person"" once a second IS. That kind of stuff really doesn't meet my criteria for information or truth.""If a celebrity basketball player tells you to buy a particular brand of batteries, ask yourself if the basketball player seems like an expert on electrochemical energy storage units before you take the player's word."" Right. ...And this is supposed to be changing my world view, my perception of myself, as promised by the book's introduction? The author seems to be under the impression that he providing revelations to unknown mysteries... in really small, easy to digest pieces with moralizing & free advice thrown in. I think some of my frustration also comes from having been introduced to most of these concepts already--hell, I've written essays and done 40 minute presentations on a few of them. So maybe I'm not really the target audience in the first place. A lot of this information has been out there for a long time, cited all over the place in books and articles. There were a couple of new ideas for me, and I'm appreciative of them, but mostly, as you might guess when a small book has 270 pages & 50 topics, the coverage is shallow. I got a bit over 100 pages in before I put it down. I have it out from the library and I'll probably pick it up to read a few sections every day until its due date. It's not that it's BAD, it just wasn't what I was looking for and the tone rubbed me the wrong way. There are people I would recommend this to; if you have never learned about any kind of social science and/or applied it to yourself, never examined your own headspace or wondered about people, it would probably be entertaining and enlightening. I'm saying, At least he cites sources."

The subject of the book is psychology based but McRaney writes in such a way that these ideas are accessible to everyone even if you don't have a degree in psychology. I found myself saying ""Wow"" a lot throughout the book.I like to think of myself as a pretty rational person. I think most of us think that we're pretty rational. McRaney points out that in some subtle ways and some not so subtle ways that we may not be as rational as we think we are. I know that McRaney has definitely made me a lot more conscious of the things that I'm thinking, feeling, or doing. For instance, have you ever been in a situation where you're talking something like an old movie to a friend and then all the sudden you keep seeing it everywhere. They're talking about it in tv. There's an article online. That old movie is suddenly everywhere. McRaney points out that we have a tendency to focus on that information and therefore we seemingly see it everywhere. Cool, eh?Anyhow, McRaney goes through all sorts of different studies that have been done to separate our commonly held beliefs versus the truths. Some of the studies were hard to read about (let's put it this way; some psychologists were not so kind and gentle) but it helps to make McRaney's point. This book is amazingly fascinating!"

But it is: it made me think a lot about the way I behave, and showed me some of the hypocritical things we all do -- it made me laugh at myself, actually.It's very easy to understand, but references real psychological experiments and has a reasonably extensive bibliography. It's fairly informal, and has short chapters, so it's very easy to digest. If you're looking to get stuck deep into considering some small aspect of human behaviour, don't pick this: it covers a lot of ground without elaborating beyond the core ideas.It's the sort of book which will probably have you telling your friends anecdotes from it.

23,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555569-marilyn,3,"I read this book in dribs and drabs, as each two to three page chapter covers one of the 46 ways people delude themselves -- and how we do it. Each chapter begins with a misconception, followed by the truth. For example:THE MISCONCEPTION: You are a rational, logical being who sees the world as it really is.THE TRUTH: You are as deluded as the rest of us, but that's OK; it keeps you sane.The book goes on to show ""how and why we are naturally hindered into thinking in certain ways and not others, and the world around you is the product of dealing with these biases, not overcoming them."" I finally was moved to finish this book NOW, because it made clear to me how political affinities work, especially when people embrace a party that largely works against their best interests. (Reading gets me away from the plethora of political ads in Ohio -- a swing state.) Ultimately, we want to be right about how we see the world, so we seek out information that confirms our beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions. Finally, I realize why someone who sticks with Ann Coulter will never read any left-leaning book -- and vice versa. It's a humbling experience to read about normalcy bias, groupthink, procrastination, social loafing, learned helplessness, and more -- and to see yourself there! In the end, I realized I'm not so smart after all, and ""thanks to a plethora of cognitive biases, faulty heuristics, and common fallacies of thought, you are probably deluding yourself minute by minute just to cope with reality."" The book spells out HOW we all do this. I recommend it. "
24,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13359689-jon-swartz,4,"A lot of great insights into the foibles of human psychology in this book. Divided into 48 short (three to five page) chapters, perfect for short modern attention spans and BART commutes, though it was hard to read more than a few chapters at a time without glazing over. Research experiments are cited in every chapter.Some favorite chapters:* The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy - in which we draw patterns around random information. Helps explain how conspiracy theories come to light - surrounding every monumental event (like the moon landing or 9/11) you will be able to find a ton of suspicious-looking data, because there is a lot of data.* Subjective Validation - in which we give way too much credence to vague statements addressed to us personally, i.e. generic horoscopes* Embodied Cognition - we translate our physical world into words which then affect our judgement. Holding a warm beverage makes you feel warm about the person you are with; holding a heavy clipboard makes you feel an interview candidate is more substantial than when holding a light one!One minor gripe is that the author seems committed to working the phrase ""you are not so smart"" in every chapter, often in a rather tortured way that takes one out of the writing. Eventually I started getting distracted waiting for the phrase to pop up like Waldo. This need for consistency is probably its own psychological foible."

As a result, each chapter is a self-contained gem packed with nerdy trivia and fascinating science. They don't necessarily build off each other, so you can browse the essays at your leisure, picking what grabs you the most.  Topics range from procrastination, brand loyalty, cult indoctrination, to the illusion of control, the bystander effect, and the straw man fallacy.  McRaney's writing is smart but funny, loaded with tons of fascinating psychological studies and pop culture references.  I found myself missing the illustrations that can be found on McRaney's blog posts but otherwise, I can't complain about this collection.  I'm running out of adjectives to express the joy I felt with each revelation (not to mention the horror, bafflement, and shock).  This is a wildly fun book that promises to surprise, amaze, and educate you!"
26,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290327-lucija,3,"Written in a interesting form, with a lot of small chapters devoted to a theme. Themes often overlap. The style reminds that the book started as a blog and editing did not do much to shake off that feeling of reading a blog. For example there is no referencing between chapters, even when in one theme of the other is mentioned. Instead of referencing, author just repeats what is needed. On the other hand, writing is very informal and some informations are incorrect. For example author incorrectly stated that Walter Freeman received the Nobel prize for his practice of lobotomy when in fact he nominated his mentor who then received it.But overall, book was very interesting and it introduced me to many weird things my brain does all the time. I will probably return to it from time to time to read some chapters and to try and preserve some guard against the tricks my brain plays on me all the time."

It passes one of my personal tests of a good book: long after I finish, (days...months...) the writer's images and ideas are still resurfacing for a little more mulling over.

He thinks he is ""so smart"", and indeed, he is so because he chose a catchy phrase like this to sell his book. The truth of the matter is, the book has nothing to do with who is smart or who is an idiot. The book simply talks about how our brains work, why we sometimes do some things the way we do and are at our wits' end trying to figure out what's happening; and this is what neuroscience books are for-trying to figure out the wiring of our brains, and if we can rewire.

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

There's also a hard line stance that science explains all and discounts any religious or spiritual beliefs. The author is a victim of his own premise, often ignoring or discounting data or alternate views to the one he wishes to impose. I thought this book might be fun and clever but its mostly dull and negative.This book is made oh-so-much-worse by the awful narrator.

39,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,1,"Another one of my quirky reviews that mainly focuses on me and what bugs me about the book. Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
40,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
41,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
42,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
43,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
44,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

45,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss.

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

For a book chock full of psychological studies and examples of cognitive failure, it's surprisingly fun. It's also really good at tricking the reader into a false sense of security or superiority, and then showing exactly why they're not so smart. I'll definitely read this again throughout my life to keep myself thinking about thinking. It seems to be a pretty good way to stop myself from tricking myself. "

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
57,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

Não tem como não gostar de um livro de teoria da mente que cita Terry Pratchett:Be careful. People like to be told what they already know. Remember that. They get uncomfortable when you tell them new things. New things . . . well, new things aren’t what they expect. They like to know that, say, a dog will bite a man. That is what dogs do. They don’t want to know that man bites a dog, because the world is not supposed to happen like that. In short, what people think they want is news, but what they really crave is olds . . .

It's hard to notice one's flaw from different track/angle. But I guess ""The strawman Fallacy"" is very common when people couldn't connect with each other over an issue. It's due to a misunderstanding from both sides.

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

The title sounded like a compilation of random facts and I suppose it is in a way. But each chapter build on each other. And the facts expressed one must remember from one chapter to the next in order to fully understand the concepts.It's all about how we as humans are deluded by certain ideas, thinking processes and facts. Some of the topics that are unpacked are as follows. 1. Procrastination2. Brand loyalty3. Confirmation Bias4. Cult Indoctrination5. Self Fulfilling Prophecys6. Learned HelplessnessEach chapter goes into the details of how we are deluded into thinking that we do procrastinate or do not procrastinate (for example), it unpacks why we procrastinate, what our brain tells us versus what is actually true, how we trick ourselves into believing certain things.The chapters are super short ... like 2-4 pages. And the facts presented (because it's all fact, not speculation on the author's part. everything is cited) are easy to understand. Some of this you will already know just because you are a living, breathing human and couldn't have missed it thus far in your earthly journey.It's an interesting book and it's in my ""to read again"" booklist here on goodreads because I think some of these topics are worth being reminded of."

Your childhood nostalgia is mostly fiction2. You have 500+ friends on social media, but your brain can only handle a maximum of 150. But you won't admit that bcause you want feel important3. You are not open minded. You only think you are because you've spent years ""discovering"" information that confirms your biases, instead of challenging them4. When someone is in trouble, you are less likely to help if there are other people present. It's called the Bystander Effect5. You think that ""venting"" makes you feel better, when in reality it increases aggresion over time. Venting makes you angrier6. You stress over little things that hardly matter but when truecatastrophe strikes, you are unusually calm and will most likely do nothing. It's called denial7.

And this book did have a few interesting psychological experiments that it mentioned. But too much of this book is a singular view of the data all of which (for the author) points to the fact that humans are not smart and our concept of free thought is a fallacy. There's also a hard line stance that science explains all and discounts any religious or spiritual beliefs. The author is a victim of his own premise, often ignoring or discounting data or alternate views to the one he wishes to impose. I thought this book might be fun and clever but its mostly dull and negative.This book is made oh-so-much-worse by the awful narrator. His tone seems to be purposefully condescending (of course this makes sense given how often the book likes to state that you are not so smart). His voice lacks any depth or excitement.Dumb book.

69,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,1,"Another one of my quirky reviews that mainly focuses on me and what bugs me about the book. Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
70,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
71,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
72,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
73,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
74,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

75,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss. I am very happy I came across a book like this that helped me become less confused."

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

It's also really good at tricking the reader into a false sense of security or superiority, and then showing exactly why they're not so smart.

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
87,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

I thought this book might be fun and clever but its mostly dull and negative.This book is made oh-so-much-worse by the awful narrator.

Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."

The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
101,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
102,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
103,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
104,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss.

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
117,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
130,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
131,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
132,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
133,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
134,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

135,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."
136,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6798013-marjolein,5,"Review You are not so Smart - David McRaneyYou are not so smart explores our cognitive biases. Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "
137,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17092768-meera-salah,5,"I don't really know where to start because this book turned my world upside down. I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss. I am very happy I came across a book like this that helped me become less confused."
138,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,4,"A guide to the common Delusions of humanity. Since I am a huge fan of delusions I obviously loved this book. Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

It's a fun book with a quick pace that races you through a bunch of our cognitive foibles. I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

For a book chock full of psychological studies and examples of cognitive failure, it's surprisingly fun. It's also really good at tricking the reader into a false sense of security or superiority, and then showing exactly why they're not so smart. I'll definitely read this again throughout my life to keep myself thinking about thinking. It seems to be a pretty good way to stop myself from tricking myself. "

We humans are irrational, illogical creatures that resort to all sort of biases and listen mostly to our gut. This book examplifies this in 48 different ways.

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
147,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270). (hide spoiler)]"

Não tem como não gostar de um livro de teoria da mente que cita Terry Pratchett:Be careful. People like to be told what they already know. Remember that. They get uncomfortable when you tell them new things. New things . . . well, new things aren’t what they expect. They like to know that, say, a dog will bite a man. That is what dogs do. They don’t want to know that man bites a dog, because the world is not supposed to happen like that. In short, what people think they want is news, but what they really crave is olds . . .

It's due to a misunderstanding from both sides.

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

The title sounded like a compilation of random facts and I suppose it is in a way. But each chapter build on each other. And the facts expressed one must remember from one chapter to the next in order to fully understand the concepts.It's all about how we as humans are deluded by certain ideas, thinking processes and facts. Some of the topics that are unpacked are as follows. 1. Procrastination2. Brand loyalty3. Confirmation Bias4. Cult Indoctrination5. Self Fulfilling Prophecys6. Learned HelplessnessEach chapter goes into the details of how we are deluded into thinking that we do procrastinate or do not procrastinate (for example), it unpacks why we procrastinate, what our brain tells us versus what is actually true, how we trick ourselves into believing certain things.The chapters are super short ... like 2-4 pages. And the facts presented (because it's all fact, not speculation on the author's part. everything is cited) are easy to understand. Some of this you will already know just because you are a living, breathing human and couldn't have missed it thus far in your earthly journey.It's an interesting book and it's in my ""to read again"" booklist here on goodreads because I think some of these topics are worth being reminded of."

Your childhood nostalgia is mostly fiction2. You have 500+ friends on social media, but your brain can only handle a maximum of 150. But you won't admit that bcause you want feel important3. You are not open minded. You only think you are because you've spent years ""discovering"" information that confirms your biases, instead of challenging them4. When someone is in trouble, you are less likely to help if there are other people present. It's called the Bystander Effect5. You think that ""venting"" makes you feel better, when in reality it increases aggresion over time. Venting makes you angrier6. You stress over little things that hardly matter but when truecatastrophe strikes, you are unusually calm and will most likely do nothing. It's called denial7.

And this book did have a few interesting psychological experiments that it mentioned. But too much of this book is a singular view of the data all of which (for the author) points to the fact that humans are not smart and our concept of free thought is a fallacy. There's also a hard line stance that science explains all and discounts any religious or spiritual beliefs. The author is a victim of his own premise, often ignoring or discounting data or alternate views to the one he wishes to impose. I thought this book might be fun and clever but its mostly dull and negative.This book is made oh-so-much-worse by the awful narrator. His tone seems to be purposefully condescending (of course this makes sense given how often the book likes to state that you are not so smart). His voice lacks any depth or excitement.Dumb book.

159,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,1,"Another one of my quirky reviews that mainly focuses on me and what bugs me about the book. Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
160,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
161,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
162,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
163,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
164,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

165,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss. I am very happy I came across a book like this that helped me become less confused."

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
177,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."

The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
191,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
192,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
193,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
194,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss.

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
207,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

219,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,1,"Another one of my quirky reviews that mainly focuses on me and what bugs me about the book. Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
220,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
221,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
222,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
223,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
224,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

225,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss.

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

It's a fun book with a quick pace that races you through a bunch of our cognitive foibles. I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

For a book chock full of psychological studies and examples of cognitive failure, it's surprisingly fun. It's also really good at tricking the reader into a false sense of security or superiority, and then showing exactly why they're not so smart. I'll definitely read this again throughout my life to keep myself thinking about thinking. It seems to be a pretty good way to stop myself from tricking myself. "

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
237,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270). (hide spoiler)]"

Não tem como não gostar de um livro de teoria da mente que cita Terry Pratchett:Be careful. People like to be told what they already know. Remember that. They get uncomfortable when you tell them new things. New things . . . well, new things aren’t what they expect. They like to know that, say, a dog will bite a man. That is what dogs do. They don’t want to know that man bites a dog, because the world is not supposed to happen like that. In short, what people think they want is news, but what they really crave is olds . . .

It's due to a misunderstanding from both sides.

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

The title sounded like a compilation of random facts and I suppose it is in a way. But each chapter build on each other. And the facts expressed one must remember from one chapter to the next in order to fully understand the concepts.It's all about how we as humans are deluded by certain ideas, thinking processes and facts. Some of the topics that are unpacked are as follows. 1. Procrastination2. Brand loyalty3. Confirmation Bias4. Cult Indoctrination5. Self Fulfilling Prophecys6. Learned HelplessnessEach chapter goes into the details of how we are deluded into thinking that we do procrastinate or do not procrastinate (for example), it unpacks why we procrastinate, what our brain tells us versus what is actually true, how we trick ourselves into believing certain things.The chapters are super short ... like 2-4 pages. And the facts presented (because it's all fact, not speculation on the author's part. everything is cited) are easy to understand. Some of this you will already know just because you are a living, breathing human and couldn't have missed it thus far in your earthly journey.It's an interesting book and it's in my ""to read again"" booklist here on goodreads because I think some of these topics are worth being reminded of."

Your childhood nostalgia is mostly fiction2. You have 500+ friends on social media, but your brain can only handle a maximum of 150. But you won't admit that bcause you want feel important3. You are not open minded. You only think you are because you've spent years ""discovering"" information that confirms your biases, instead of challenging them4. When someone is in trouble, you are less likely to help if there are other people present. It's called the Bystander Effect5. You think that ""venting"" makes you feel better, when in reality it increases aggresion over time. Venting makes you angrier6. You stress over little things that hardly matter but when truecatastrophe strikes, you are unusually calm and will most likely do nothing. It's called denial7.

And this book did have a few interesting psychological experiments that it mentioned. But too much of this book is a singular view of the data all of which (for the author) points to the fact that humans are not smart and our concept of free thought is a fallacy. There's also a hard line stance that science explains all and discounts any religious or spiritual beliefs. The author is a victim of his own premise, often ignoring or discounting data or alternate views to the one he wishes to impose. I thought this book might be fun and clever but its mostly dull and negative.This book is made oh-so-much-worse by the awful narrator. His tone seems to be purposefully condescending (of course this makes sense given how often the book likes to state that you are not so smart). His voice lacks any depth or excitement.Dumb book.

249,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,1,"Another one of my quirky reviews that mainly focuses on me and what bugs me about the book. Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
250,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
251,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
252,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
253,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
254,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

255,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."

Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "

I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss. I am very happy I came across a book like this that helped me become less confused."

Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
267,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).

But my remark is solely about the style by which the book was written and not it's fundamental idea. The idea as I understood it is as follows: Being nothing more than evolved primates our brains only purpose has always been nothing more than to sustain our lives. thanks to how our brains function, our ancestors were able to avoid being hunted by predators, acquire nutrition and successfully find mating partners. meaning the homo sapien's brain is much more advanced and intricate than that of a fly but differing only in degree of complexity.Due to the aforementioned reason we continuously make mistakes when we try to think rationally and logically. Psychology has provided us with empirical results of experiments that repeatedly reveal to us our intrinsic imperfection when attempting to reason. Personally I find this very disturbing; to know that my brain which I regard highly and have always relied on as the only tool to seek truth is very flawed. And all the highly esteemed men and women of humanity like great leaders, philosophers and scientists were reasoning and coming to conclusions using nothing but an advanced reptilian brain.There is no objective truth and if there is we will never find it. This is very much a gloomy idea."

Any side effect of bringing insight to this book is purely accidental.The Good:All the chapter headings nicely summarize biases, brain tricks and outright erroneous thinking, some of which have been written about elsewhere but were worth reviewing.The Bad:I found the tone irritating and to me it seemed he regularly wrote with an appeal to authority,with himself as the all omniscient one (he did have some specific stories from psychologists but often there was a phrase like ""the research says..."" but on those occasions he never elaborated or provided a footnote or endnote) . He was ruthless pointing out stupidity of you, You and YOU, and ME…but totally ignored his opinion presented as fact and applying any stupid thinking he found to EVERYBODY….meaning you, You and YOU, and ME, but NOT him.I guess he was making a point, after all the name of the book is 
You Are Not So Smart
, so what was I expecting? Well I was expecting somebody writing about human inconsistency to be consistent.For instance, he says……you have evolved mental mechanisms designed to make you feel awesome about yourself .…But he doesn’t address at all the boat loads of people who DON’T feel awesome about themselves. I get it that some do but what about the ones that don’t? How do they fit in to the evolved mental mechanism? And how did he measure everybody's self esteem anyway? Where did he get his ""everybody feels awesome"" number?And then this on people finding information sources that only validate their own view point, which I agree is a huge temptation. But he says…Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann , Glenn Beck and Arianna Huffing - ton , Rachel Maddow and Ann Coulter — these people provide fuel for beliefs , they pre - filter the world to match existing worldviews . If their filter is like your filter , you love them . If it isn’t , you hate them . You watch them not for information , but for confirmation ….you seek out information that confirms your beliefs and avoid contradictory evidence and opinions . (p. 30). Kindle Edition. But he never considers that not all information is equal, he implies all books are of the same value. Does it matter if one book is filled with misinformation and the other has accurate information? I get it that we look for confirmation for our views, but is it equally stupid to rely on actual verifiable facts to reinforce your view and not outright lies? Basically if I suspect something, investigate and find my leaning confirmed by evidence, am I stupid for relying on a book that is accurate but confirms my original thought?He follows that up with…Did we really put a man on the moon ? If you are looking for proof we didn’t , you can find it . (p. 31). Kindle EditionBut he just said YOU only look for information that confirms your believe so if I read about going to the moon am I stupid for believing that? Is believing that there was a moon landing just bias? Surely not, but he never covers nuance or shading...everything is always cut and dried. But in one sense he is saying EVERYBODY (meaning YOU and ME) are wrong about believing anything and really he implies nobody is ever right. it is all just bias. I know it seems silly but he never addresses sorting through the bias and finding something true. It is left to us to assume (since he doesn't spell it out) it is just bias until he, McRaney, appropriates one view and says it is true. You will know something is true once he writes it down.He says…In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. ...But he leaves it at that. So I should consult Alex jones on how the government works? He lumps so much together it is hard to draw any useful conclusions.I guess my main beef is that he says a lot and implies a lot, and he makes some broad generalization and just expects you to accept his conclusions about YOU.Talking about how stupid people are on their Netflix queue (as some sharp social indicator I guess)...Instead, people tended to pick lowbrow movies on the first day . Only 44 percent went for the heavier stuff first. The majority tended to pick comedies,  (p. 46). Kindle Edition. But even if this was a useful measure of something, 44% is still large a pretty big percentage of anything, so I don’t see what it proves. Then he drops a number of insights to show how stupid YOU are…Present bias is why you’ve made the same resolution for the tenth year in a row , but this time you mean it . (p. 47). Kindle Edition. I am probably taking this personally, but maybe it is also true resolutions fail because exercise and diet are HARD to change. And along those lines…This is why food plans like Nutrisystem work for many people. (p. 52). Kindle Edition. But a quick Google search says 2/3 fail and gain back more (just like every other diet). So again it just seems sloppy. He makes a broad claim with no statistics or references to back it up and we are supposed to take his word for it, and ignore any evidence we might find, because that is just our bias.To recap, or restate or whatever..., even though I think all of his headings are mostly true, his presentation is sloppy and inconsistent.And another ""for instance""...there is this…In the Poster Test, most people truly preferred the nice painting to the inspirational cat, but they couldn’t conjure up a rational explanation of why, at least not in a way that would make logical sense on paper. On the other hand , you can write all sorts of bullshit about a motivational poster . It has a stated and tangible purpose.(p. 67). Kindle Edition. Dang it, you can also write bullshit about a pretty pic.… and I don't know why these students couldn't come up with some bullshit reason they liked a pretty poster, but I am positive I can write some stupid bullshit about any poster or picture, that is why it is called bullshit. Maybe that study needed a better batch of students, or maybe lazier students who are used to coming up with a bunch of crap to write for a paper they forgot to prepare for.And also this…[Moby Dick and an early bad review…] is held up as an example of the best pieces of literature ever written . Chances are, though, no one can truly explain why . (p. 69). Kindle Edition. And he just leaves it there, what is he implying? Moby Dick should not be considered a classic? Or better yet explain why or why not. [As an aside I doubt his claim that no one can truly explain why they think Moby Dick is good]There is a bunch more stuff that bothered me, but I think it is just something about my personality that is irritated by his examples.The only other complaint is this reminds me that psychologists can be sadist S.O.B.s…In 1965 , a psychologist named Martin Seligman started shocking dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. when he rang his bell , instead of providing food , he zapped the dogs with electricity . To keep them still , he restrained them in a harness during the experiment …. You are just like these dogs . (p. 206). Kindle Edition. In another study by Seligman , he grafted cancer cells into rats so they would develop fatal tumors . The rats were then given routine electric shocks (p. 207). Kindle Edition. Yeah, we are just like dogs and cats and rats... and I bet none of us like being bound up, hacked on and shocked.I guess that is my own bias. Make of that what you will.Bottom line, read the Undoing Project by Lewis instead."
280,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,4,"This is a great book that helps us take a realistic look into human behavior which seems complex in its nature but indeed it is greatly affected by illusions and shortcuts that were left over from our evolutionary past. The biggest takeaway from the book could be the suggestion that we should not judge people immediately and understand what kind of behavior lead them to do the actions they do and what kind of perception of reality we have in those particular situations. It seems human works with pattern recognition and generalizations, and these kind of attributes might lead to misinterpretations. There are also parts of the book that demonstrates how we are not as smart as we think we are. The defense mechanisms sometimes mislead us to think we are smarter and more able to do certain things. Reading this book will definitely make you question some of the things you do in your daily life. Also, all chapters are accompanied by some previous scientific experiment(s) related to the argument the author proposes which makes the book much more credible."
281,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself is a blog turned book that aims to explore many of the common biases and errors in decision-making that have made the field of behavioral economics so active in the last few decades. Author David McRaney confesses to not being a psychologist (hey, it happens) but he does a pretty darn good impersonation of throughout the book’s 48 chapters, each of which is dedicated to one reason why you may not be so smart about day-to-day decision-making as you think.In general, McRaney does a good job of making each one of these 48 topics accessible. He doesn’t talk over a general audience’s head, yet he usually manages to work in descriptions of the research and scientific evidence that each chapter’s topic is predicated on. And it helps that by and large each topic is something that most readers can relate to --remembering childhood events, procrastinating, deciding what brands to buy, affirming your political beliefs, responding to authority figures, arguing with idiots on the Internet, and the like. The book’s schtick is that through its revelation of common errors and biases related to these topics it constantly posits that you aren’t as smart or rational as you might think, because you are no exception to the effects described. Each chapter tries to hook you with declarations of a common misconception and a related truth. It’s the kind of “See, science and psychology matter to YOU and your everyday life” stuff that I love reading about. You should find something interesting in every chapter.The other thing that makes the book approachable is that McRaney isn’t afraid to use informal language and specific cultural references. The book is replete with references to Battlestar Galactica, World of Warcraft, and other touchstones. It also contains occasional phrases like “this is bullshit” and “what the hell?” and other casual language that makes it feel like you’re listening to someone go on about this stuff over a beer or a shared commute. It’s a friendly and refreshing tone for which I’d like to thank not only the author for offering, but also his editor for allowing.The book’s roots as a blog also show through in that most of the chapters are very short --some are in fact as brief as a healthy blog post, it may not surprise you to find out. On the one hand, this can be nice because you can nibble your way through the book, working through one or two of the chapters at a time if you’re not up to taking huge bites. It also makes the book easier to use as a reference later if you want to return to one of the errors or biases.On the other hand, though, I think the book often misses the opportunity to tell stories that give some more context and meat to the phenomena it describes. Other books in this same vein that I’ve read have walked the reader through narratives about either how the researchers developed their ideas and experiments, or told stories about real-life applications of the biases and mental hiccups they describe. In his book How We Decide, for example, Jonah Lehrer frames a discussion about dopamine predictions by describing how a Lieutenant Commander in the British Navy reacted to odd readings from his radar display and barely saved many lives in the process. There’s none of this gripping storytelling in You Are Not So Smart, nor does McRaney do anything along the lines of tying several related topics into one larger concept, like maybe how our instincts to preserve our self image worm their way into an astonishing array of daily decisions. This book is clearly a collection of blog entries based on a bullet list of topics. And while that has its appeal, if McRaney does a follow-up work I’d probably enjoy it more if he really took his time to research some interesting background material and weave a bigger picture out of all the individual strands."
282,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624318-larry,4,"Back during the absurd era of my life called my college years, I took a psychology course. To complete the class, I was required to take part in experiments directed by graduate students. I made sure I picked the tasks that simply involved filling out questionnaires. I thought that would be easiest and fastest. Unfortunately, the questions were very long and very deep. It would take a lot of time to read through the moral dilemmas and think about them.So, being efficient, I circled any old answer, not bothering to read the questions. I turned in my survey ASAP, got my credit and took off for the pizza joint. No one stopped me or asked how I was done so quickly. It's for that reason that I've always been a little skeptical of surveys and psychology experiments. Plus, psych students are sneaky. They're always lying to you to test your reaction or setting up situations so you look like a jerk. I'm not your lab rat, bro.All that said, I love psychology. It's simply fascinating. I would describe myself as David McRaney, author of You Are Not So Smart describes himself in the book's author bio: I am a psychology nerd. That's part of the reason I write fiction. Fiction is a giant psychology lab, where you can experiment however you like without obnoxious college students skewing your data.So when I say You Are Not So Smart is a great book I come from a psychology nerd perspective. For you non-psych-nerds, this book may be less of a thrill, but it is still a worthwhile read for anyone. In fact, it probably should be required reading in our era of ever-present propaganda.You Are Not So Smart functions like a reference book, a catalog of ways you are deceived by your thoughts, society and your biology. The problem is that reference books aren't necessarily fun to read front to back. They're better browsed. The book is a list, and a non-escalating one. Though some chapters reference each other, they don't build on each other, so there's no sense of crescendo. Fortunately, McRaney has a light style and a cool sense of humor. In a lesser writer's hands this would have been dry and dull (like a college psychology survey, perhaps.)Some chapters will blow your mind as you realize the perceptive error described fits you perfectly. Other chapters simply don't apply to you. They describe thinking mistakes that you don't commit or have learned to guard against. Parts of the book are life-changers in their revelations, other parts are filed under BTDT (Been there, done that.)Another negative side effect of the book is that after being told I'm not so smart so many times, by the end I just wanted to scream, ""Okay I'm stupid! I don't know anything!"" That outburst is the point of the whole book and its ultimate value. I'll never be the same. My intent is to carry the lessons learned forever.I would have liked to see some sort of diagnosing graph that called your attention to chapters that described how you (or someone else) were not so smart specifically, a sort of DSM for bad thinking habits. (DSM is psych-speak for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)Overall, I recommend You Are Not So Smart for everyone. Even if you're not a psychology nerd, we can all do with a dose of humility in our thinking.Larry Nocellaauthor of the novel, Loser's Memorial"
283,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,3,"A Malcolm-Gladwell-esque work of pop-fiction that mines the work of psychology and neurology to find amusing, and often alarming, ways in which we are all not so smart. To my relief, McRaney kept things on the lighter side for the most part, not jumping to any extreme ""you therefore have no free will"" conclusions. After all, we need to remind ourselves that the act of reading or writing a book about self-delusion requires us to somehow be outside of delusion (or at least, those particular delusions). How else could we agree it was delusion, right?An interesting thing I found about reading this book was that I kept thinking ""Man, I know someone who commits that fallacy all the time!"" I caught myself doing it a few times and kept having to steer myself back to more humble ground. Turns out, no surprise, that this is yet another common fallacy we all commit in our thinking. Like the common belief that advertisements only work on other people.If you are going to really get something out of this book, aside from entertainment and a few clever ways to make other people look like idiots (it's very tempting to try out a few of the ""expectation"" experiments to put wine snobs in their place), you have to keep reminding yourself that everything in this book applies to you. On another note, I'm now pretty intrigued with the idea of turning this self-knowledge into hacks. How can I trick myself into being happier, nicer, tidier, more goal-oriented? And the very idea that I might have the power to play such tricks makes me less worried that I am merely an automaton, slavishly controlled by subconscious responses to my environment. Who's not so smart now?"
284,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,4,"this was just a small, fun book about human psychology. specifically, it is a brief examination of 48 ways humans delude themselves into thinking they may be smarter than they actually are.most people who have taken an intro psychology class or gotten into an argument on an internet forum are probably familiar with at least a few of the topics this book addresses, such as ad hominem arguments, the straw man fallacy, self-fulfilling prophecies, & the bystander effect. some of the others may be new. all are covered in very brief chapters (generall four or five pages each) full of rather witty examples & psychological case studies. some of the chapters even included little psychological tests so you can actually subject yourself to an examination of the fallacy under review, which i thought was a fun touch. i added a new bookshelf for this book (something new i am trying), which i'm calling ""gift book-adjacent"". that means this is the kind of book you might pick up in the airport bookstore when you are flying to see relatives you don't actually know that well & it suddenly occurs to you that maybe you should bring a gift. it's the kind of book you might see in the bathroom of a friend who subscribes to ""the new yorker"". it's the kind of book that says, ""why, hello. i am interested in neuroscience. but you know. not TOO interested. not interested enough to actually read a book about neuroscience."" but it's great for what it is & i will certainly be somewhat more reflective about my own cognitive biases for...oh, the next week or so.

285,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2216519-sheila,4,"An intriguing and fun book to read. It can almost be considered a self-help book for businessmen instead of housewives. Oops, could that be my ""fundamental attributions"" playing a trick on me. I even thought he was writing about me when he talked about happiness for the moment. He used an example of eating ice cream, which I just happen to be doing when I read that chapter. Wierd. Then again, could I have been using the ""Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"". After all there have been a lot of bear sightings in the Cape recently so there must be an invasion of them. It couldn't be that the news is just overly obsessed with bears these days. (This will make more sense when you read this book) ""Groupthink"" and ""social loafing"" affirm my strong beliefs that group projects in grad school should be banned and touted as wasted valuable student time with no resulting attribute except to prove that ""Groupthink"" and ""Social Loafing"" are real. The evolution of this book from a blog and an the inspiration of a high school psychology teacher is also amazing considering the amount of research McRaney had to employ to dig up some of these less-than-perfect studies to prove how deluded we are. And considering the guy's from Mississippi--OMG I'm sure I'm committing a deluded faux pau there. Although the writing is confusing at times (rarely), his examples and comments are hysterical and the book dispels magical thinking--Yeah! He even explains why men are into blow up dolls, and he debugs wine connoisseurs. You'll absorb a lot, forget the titles, but walk away amused and blown away."
286,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6798013-marjolein,5,"Review You are not so Smart - David McRaneyYou are not so smart explores our cognitive biases. Each chapter covers another mental fallacy. Although I have read quite a lot of similar books by now, I liked this one. McRaney has a clear, easy to follow style of presenting content. He connects everyday human behaviour with scientific studies in a very casual, enjoyable and entertaining way.If you have read Lehrer, Kahneman, Taleb and/or Duhigg you are familiar with almost all ideas presented. Not so much new here. But still, McRaney brings the message short and sweet, and you might prefer this book to all others. There were two issues that are not raised by similar books:- supernormal stimuli - I knew this from Deirdre Barretts book - for my review see: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... but this topic is not covered that much elsewhere to my knowledge- most of the people paralyse in extreme stress situations. They do not panic, run and save themselves as soon as possible, instead they stay calm, make phone calls, gather their things, and then leave, or just stay put. Amazing. I did not know that.All in all I can recommend ""You are not so smart"", nice, crystally clear written overview of irrational behaviour of humans. "
287,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17092768-meera-salah,5,"I don't really know where to start because this book turned my world upside down. I must admit in the beginning I was skeptical as to whether I should read a book that tells me I am neither smart or special but the more I read the book the more I realized that is exactly the reason this book needs to be read. This book helped explain alot of aspects of human behaviors that I have always had trouble understanding, behaviors in myself and others. I have always lacked sympathy for other people's actions because I can't help but see them as pre-meditated evil traps that I seem to fall into but turns out alot of time people have no clue why they do what they do. Also, it helped me come to terms with the variability of subjective experiences, like why when you recall a memory with someone close to you, you seem to have completely different recollections of the same event or why you can't agree on one fixed interpretation of your favorite movie with your peers.But overall I learned just how deluded I and everyone around me can be which despite what anyone says ignorance towards the origins of your actions is not a bliss. I am very happy I came across a book like this that helped me become less confused."
288,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,4,"A guide to the common Delusions of humanity. Since I am a huge fan of delusions I obviously loved this book. Nothing is more entertaining and tragic than the sheer prevalence, consistency and destructive potential of individual and collectively held delusions and our terrible inability to even see them. Humans have an uncanny ability to intentionally blind themselves without even realizing we're doing it. This book lists off all the ways that we distort reality through forcing our perceptions of reality to conform with our expectations of it. Essentially, we try and see what we want to see. Our biases help facilitate this and self-reinforce it through Confirmation Bias, focusing on only the details that confirm our beliefs while disregarding the ones that contradict it.The true sign of Ignorance may not be a lack of ""knowledge"" but more a lack of ""Self-Awareness"". Being oblivious to how one perceives. "

It's a fun book with a quick pace that races you through a bunch of our cognitive foibles. I say ""our"" though I noticed that another reviewer found the book condescending because she felt that the author was implying that the behaviours described in the book do not apply to him. It seems highly unlikely that someone writing a book like this would lack that level of self-awareness.The book has reminded me to re-look at some situations and ask myself some (obvious once you know them) questions so that I can perhaps make my decisions from a different perspective."

For a book chock full of psychological studies and examples of cognitive failure, it's surprisingly fun. It's also really good at tricking the reader into a false sense of security or superiority, and then showing exactly why they're not so smart. I'll definitely read this again throughout my life to keep myself thinking about thinking. It seems to be a pretty good way to stop myself from tricking myself. "

Some of the things were familiar, but when it comes to how you are deluding yourself, I suppose you can't face the truth often enough. We humans are irrational, illogical creatures that resort to all sort of biases and listen mostly to our gut. This book examplifies this in 48 different ways. The one thing that did get annoying was the the ""you are not so smart"" comment which was included in every chapter. "

You're not the only one imagining themselves responding heroically in a crisis. You are unaware how much your conditioning and preconceived notions determine your own behavior when interacting with other people. You think you're correct in your morals because you read articles saying that you're right because those are the articles you seek out; ones that validate your current opinion. I generally consider myself a master procrastinator so, it was fantastic learning why I operate that way. (Hint: It comes down to, which is greater? The reward for doing it now, or the reward for doing it later?) The next time I'm in the mood to procrastinate, I think I will think over my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. I want to see if this is true. I'm going to experiment on my own brain.I've always found psychology fun, so this was a bright, easy read. It's a good way to look at the why and how your brain works the way it does. Anecdotes mixed with scientific studies and real life scenarios illustrate theories of psychology that make a lot of sense. Take some time and learn some ways to pick apart your own brain. Once you understand certain aspects, it may even make you a better person."
297,1592406599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,3,"This book presents various ways we delude ourselves, or in other words, the ways in which we don't think the way we think that we think. Although the information in it is useful and the writing style vibrant, I was astounded by the number of errors it contains. If you're going to publish summaries of studies you have a duty to read the studies thoroughly and paraphrase them faithfully. McRaney doesn't seem to have done this as carefully as he ought to have.I sent McRaney a list of errata. He replied to apologize sincerely, to thank me for politely pointing out the errors, and to say that future editions will have them corrected; in the first edition, he had been pressured by a major publisher to turn his popular blog into a book in only three months. Some factual errors you should be aware of if reading an earlier version of the book are:(view spoiler)[ * McRaney mentions a study by Ariely and Wertenbroch on procrastination held over the course of three weeks (50). The study was spread over a twelve-week semester, not over three weeks. (Source: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely, p. 114) * He writes that ""To suddenly stop moving and hope for the best is called fear bradycardia"" (59). The word ""bradycardia"" just means a slow heartbeat; it can happen as a result of freezing from fear, but is not itself the proper term for such freezing. The proper term is tonic immobility, which McRaney throws in in the next sentence. * McRaney assumes that an experiment dividing a sum of $10 between two people scales linearly when dividing $1,000,000 (116-7). I see no evidence to suggest that this is the case. Although people would be offended enough to reject the money if offered only $1 by a person dividing $10, they would probably still accept the same portion ($100,000) of a million. I know of no evidence to suggest that people will turn down massive amounts of money out of petty spite. * He writes that ""a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health"" (133). That should say ""a waist-to-hip ratio."" Obesity does not correlate to health.  * He writes that when subjects ""rated their abilities after being primed to think the task was considered simple, people said they performed better than average"" (159). This shift sounded so illogical that I looked up the paper referenced to check what it said; I found that this rating wasn't in fact a result of priming but a result of the easy task actually being easier than the difficult one (not just being the same task referred to differently). People think they perform above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult ones, but it's not true that telling them a task is easy will make them think they did above average on it. Think about it: if I were to tell you that a difficult task was ""easy"" for others, you would assume yourself to be even further below average because it was not easy for you — the opposite of what McRaney writes. * ""The most famous conformity experiment was performed by Stanley Milgram in 1963"" (187). The experiments actually began in 1961. They were published in 1963. * ""psychologist Hazel Markus at the University of Michigan says..."" (241). Markus studied at the University of Michigan, but she's a professor at Stanford. Also McRaney repeatedly refers to Hazel Markus as ""he."" She's a she."" (hide spoiler)]One of the principles of self-delustion that struck home with me was hindsight bias: the tendency to believe that we've always known something after we learn about it for the first time. I tend to do that quite a bit, which gets frustrating because sometimes it feels like I'm not learning from what I've read. Recently I've found that that jotting down notes about interesting points the book raised as soon as I come to those points helps to combat hindsight bias. (It also helps to remember and to find the source again later. I recommend doing it.) Some such points in this book are:(view spoiler)[ * People subconsciously connect washing their hands with washing away guilt (2-3). * When stockings are placed side by side, people are most likely to think the ones on the right are the best, but when asked why they think this, they say it has nothing to do with the position (25). * Hindsight bias says that after we know something (such as after reading a study), it seems obvious that that thing was true. We'll even agree with opposite viewpoints after hearing different proverbs supporting them (32-5). * Counteracting procrastination may not be so much about having willpower in the moment as about developing ways to set clear plans and stick to them (44-52). * When you rate the risks and benefits of something and then read about the risks, you will then regard not only the risks as being greater, but also the benefits as being lesser (144). (The reverse is true if you read about the benefits instead.) * After witnessing a staged crime and then being asked to pick the criminal out of the lineup 78% of people identified one of the innocent people in the line even though the person who acted as a criminal was not present (179). * If you give two groups lists of words to unscramble where the first two puzzles are hard for one group and easy for the other — and have everyone move on to the next word once the people in the easy group have finished solving theirs — then by the time you get to a third word (which is the same for both lists) the group with the hard initial words will not solve it because they will have learned helplessness (207-8). * Sometimes when you are afraid of failure you may handicap yourself ahead of time so that if you fail you can blame it on the handicap rather than your own abilities (227-30).  * Even when people are told that debaters are arguing in favor of a side assigned to them, they still assume that those people actually believe what they're saying (270).
