It is a book written by a man about a man's world for men. The ""Our' in the title does not include half the world. The misogny, the putting down of fat women, ugly ones, old ones in this often otherwise insightful and percipient book is making me groan. The author is trying to prove something we all know, that we (he uses 'we' and 'our' to sound inclusive, but he only means men really) do not make good decisions when sexually aroused. To that end he sets up an experiment where the men, MIT students, will have to answer a set of questions 'sober' and while they are wanking to pictures of buxom young women flashed on their computers.The questions include, Would you want to have sex with a really fat woman? An ugly one? A woman over 50? All the undesirable women. All these women are put down as sexual objects these really clever guys wouldn't want to have sex with unless they were so aroused by any stimuli they didn't care. That their general powers of discernment and decision-making ie. we don't screw fat,ugly or old women, would go by the board because at that stage they'd screw anything. Also, that in such an aroused state, those clever MIT men, future leaders of technology and business, perhaps even footballers) those men might deliberately get a woman drunk and/or persist in pushy or downright aggressive sexual advances even after she had said 'no' and they wouldn't give a monkeys about using a condom either.(Part of me wonders how those men felt who had girlfriends who didn't look like supermodels).Personally I think he wrote up the experiment so as he could begin with describing the visual of a cling-film (saran wrap to Americans) wrapped computer (to protect it from splashes of semen) flashing porn and questions and a man 'furiously wanking with his left hand' while propped up on the bed. Ok, so I'm predictably irrational about books that slag off my half the human race. You know that I will pick up the misogyny and be compelled to write about it."

My dear friend Graham recommended I read this book. He has recommended four books to me – and the only one I couldn’t finish was “My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist: A novel” by Mark Leyler – but he did recommend, “The Tetherballs of Bougainville” also by Leyler and that is still one of the most remarkable books I’ve ever read. I haven't written a review of that book, but where the hell would I start?When I’m reading books I often think – you know, I would like to re-write this. I would cut out a lot of the fluff and perhaps change the voice a bit, add some cellos, perhaps even a bassoon (there is nothing that can’t be improved with some cellos and a bassoon). But not this book. I really, really liked this book.This is a companion to Freakonomics – except I liked this one even more. Which reminds me that I must look how many stars I gave that one so that I can give this one more… If I am going to be irrational I might as well work at being consistently irrational.Which is the point of this book. Economic Rationalism – otherwise known as the nonsense that got us into this mess – holds that the world is full of rational economic units and you are just one of those units. We always know what is good for us, we are free to choose what we need and we invariably make the choices that reflect our best interests. The absurdity of this view is being played out as I type with the world financial markets in meltdown and with the new Prime Minister of Japan saying today – “Honestly, this for us is beyond our imagination. We have huge fears going ahead,"" Which I believe is Japanese for, “The fundamentals are all in place. We have nothing to worry about.”Like Freakonomics this presents a series of experiments to show how we behave under various circumstances in ways that are both less than rational and yet perfectly predictable. I’m going to have to spoil bits of this book, but just to show you how wonderful it is and why you need to run to your local purvayour of tantalising texts to obtain your copy of this fine book.I guess one could group a lot of the experiments in this book under the general title of Placebo Effect. This makes two books in a row in which the Placebo Effect has been given a starring role and I’m, quite frankly, in seventh heaven. One of the questions this book seeks to answer is whether social stereotypes have an impact on a person’s performance. THIS IS THE SPOILER – SO LOOK AWAY IF YOU MUST.What do we know? Well, we definitely know that all Asians are brilliant at mathematics. This is as true as the fact that anyone with an English accent is a mass murderer – or at least, that is definitely true in that strange world that is American movies and IRA propaganda. The other thing you know about mathematics is that all women are hopelessly, pathetically, mathematically inept. What is it about that Y chromosome? You might have noticed that the particular Venn Diagram I am describing here has a rather interesting intersection – that is, woman who have a preference for thinking of themselves as Asian. Let’s see if we can’t mess around with the minds of this particular sub-set of humanity.We are going to give them a bit of a maths test in a minute – but before we do, let’s ‘prime’ them. Let’s ask half of them some questions related to them being Asian (not too obvious, let’s just ask questions like how many languages do you speak, what is your migrant experience – you know, vague enough so we aren’t directly saying “THINK ASIAN, THINK ASIAN” at them, but actually, when you think about it a little bit, that is exactly what we are doing). The other half we will ask questions that make them think about themselves being female – when was the last time you bought Cosmo or ‘Are those really your nails?’Anyway, then you give them the maths test. And guess what? The Asians who have been primed to think of themselves as women did worse on the test than the women who were primed to think of themselves as Asians. When I hear things like that a shiver runs down my spine. I know I have learnt something incredibly important and something I’m going to have to think about for days and days and weeks. And this book is over-flowing with exactly that kind of idea. The sort of thing that makes you go – shit, who’d have thought?I mean, which other book have you read lately that asks a MIT student if he would be willing to have sex with a sheep while he is masturbating to images of naked women displayed on a Mac laptop covered in Glad Wrap? Actually, don’t answer that.The stuff in this book about stealing and its relationship to money is so interesting I can only just stop myself not telling you about it. We used to have a President of the Liberal Party (don’t be confused by the name, the Liberals here are as far right as the Republicans in the US) called John Elliot who basically stole – never tested in court (but then, he was rich and politically well connected) $66 million and was released on a technicality. Yet another of our Corporate Magnates, Richard Pratt, recently was able to steal $300 million from the Australian people and only had to repay $36 million. This time his crime was tested in court, but he is still seen as some sort of corporate hero here, rather than the thief that he is. How is this possible? Well, this book will help you understand and perhaps even help you see what we can do about these abominations. I loved this book. It is a romp and the guy telling the stories is just the nicest person to be around while he chats away to you. Okay, sometimes I got a little annoyed with the “You’ll never guess what happened” – style – but this was such a minor criticism I feel petty bringing it up.A large part of what I do in life involves negotiating stuff – actually, that is also true of you too, it is just that the negotiations I’m involved in are more up front than the ones you probably do day by day. As much as I don’t like to admit this, this book taught me things about negotiating that I ought to have known before. Not since Getting to Yes have I read a book quite as worthwhile or one that made me re-think stuff I do in quite the same way. I hope to be able to say in six months time that I’m still considering the implications of some of the ideas in this book – if I’m not, then more is the pity for me.You’ve been told. What the hell are you waiting for?Oh, except you Tina – you are the only person in the world I wouldn’t recommend buy this book. When was your birthday again?"
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291120-mary,2,"This book was somewhat entertaining, but I can't really recommend it. The author does experiments with college students and beer, and extrapolates this into a world view. Most of his applications are anecdotal.Here's an example on p. 215: ""Iran is another example of a nation stricken by distrust. An Iranian student at MIT told me that business there lacks a platform of trust. Because of this, no one pays in advance, no one offers credit, and no one is willing to take risks. People must hire within their families, where some level of trust exists. Would you like to live in such a world?"" Excuse me, but I prefer to base my world view on more than just the impressions of 1 college student, but this is an example of how he doesn't use logic to come to his conclusions. Here's another tidbit on p. 218 ""...drug companies cheat by sending doctors and their wives off on posh vacations."" Using Ariely's logic, this means that all doctors are male, or the women doctors are all lesbians with wives. His experiments on cheating have flaws. Since the ""cheating"" group scored more than the ""non-cheating"" group, the cheating group MUST have cheated; but they were allowed to destroy their answer sheets. There is no proof that this group cheated; they could have just come from a higher level class, or had more coffee. Did you notice how he leads you to the conclusions he wants you to reach? Would an objective researcher characterize one of his subjects as ""a clever master's student with a charming Indian accent?"" Wouldn't you be more likely to agree with the conclusion than if the participant was a ""clever hunchback with an aversion to bathing?"" He ascribes all kinds of emotions to his subjects throughout the book. It's not that it isn't worth a read - just realize he's working on your predictability to lead you to his conclusions."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Written in the tried-and-tested and bestselling tradition of the Malcolm Gladwell books and the Frekonomics clones, Dan Ariely's book too is an entertaining and counter-intuitive look at the world around us. While I am getting more and more inured to this way of analysis of behavioral economics and physchology, these kinds of books are still hard to resist - that is because they do, no matter if they have now become an industry doling out similiar books by the dozens, still stretch our perspectives about the things we normally take for granted or think unworthy of a second thought. In that sense then, this book was ""unputdownable"" and ""highly instructive"".One of my favorite passages from the book is as follows - ""I suspect that one answer lies in the realm of social norms. As we learned in our experiments, cash will take you only so far—social norms are the forces that can make a difference in the long run. Instead of focusing the attention of the teachers, parents, and kids on test scores, salaries, and competitions, it might be better to instill in all of us a sense of purpose, mission, and pride in education. To do this we certainly can't take the path of market norms. The Beatles proclaimed some time ago that you ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and this also applies to the love of learning—you can't buy it; and if you try, you might chase it away. So how can we improve the educational system? We should probably first rethink school curricula, and link them in more obvious ways to social goals (elimination of poverty and crime, elevation of human rights, etc.), technological goals (boosting energy conservation, space exploration, nanotechnology, etc.), and medical goals (cures for cancer, diabetes, obesity, etc.) that we care about as a society. This way the students, teachers, and parents might see the larger point in education and become more enthusiastic and motivated about it. We should also work hard on making education a goal in itself, and stop confusing the number of hours students spend in school with the quality of the education they get. Kids can get excited about many things (baseball, for example), and it is our challenge as a society to make them want to know as much about Nobel laureates as they now know about baseball players. I am not suggesting that igniting a social passion for education is simple; but if we succeed in doing so, the value could be immense.""This is in the same wavelength as some of my thoughts on education -The point is not to have a vocation oriented educational system, but rather to have a Goal-Oriented one... I think that the abstractness in what the students want to achieve is a problem arising directly from an abstract education. A system which promotes and encourages students to fix goals in life early and then helps them in moving towards it and rewards them for moving towards it is my vision of Utopia in Education :) - There will not be specific courses and subjects being taught in schools and universities but there will be Goal-oriented teams formed with advisors for them and they work together to learn, understand and develop themselves in any field or knowledge that is required to fulfill their stated goals...I am hoping to convert this idea on education into a short story or incorporate it into my ongoing novel. So the book helped me crystallize that thought.Sorry for the tangent. Getting back to the book, one more caveat - the author loses the plot a bit in the middle chapters. The beginning chapters about relativity and the power of zero were amusing and fun and the last two chapters on honesty is amazing, but the chapters in between was a bit of a drag.Despite my mocking tone and slightly negative review, I will hurry to say that it is a very good purchase for anyone who enjoyed Gladwell's books or others of that genre, and also for marketeers and businessmen and maybe even for policy makers. Despite sugar coating the book with the requirements of this genre/industry, Dan does raise some poignant questions about human nature and consumer behavior that is worth pondering over. In the final analysis then, I enjoyed the book and will read it again, and hence, four stars."

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,Honestly all the business books that talk about psychological research or behavioral economics talk about the same things. I haven't even read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman but all these books literally rehash it again and again so I probably wouldn't even get anything out of reading it now. That said this one's much better written than most of the other books I've read and so if you haven't read anything else about behavioral economics or that way we make decisions this is a good choice. If you have read other books on those things though I'd skip this one because it doesn't add anything new.
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851962-ryan,3,"As a social psychologist, I have been trained to scoff at all ""behavioral economists"" because they often claim to have recently discovered that individuals do not always behave ""rationally"". Furthermore, they seem to brilliantly deduce that the only way to accurately predict how humans actually behave is to test behavior/decision making empirically. Of course, social psychologists have been doing this for over half a century without much public fanfare or guest spots on ""MSNBC"" or ""CNN"" every time people want to know how consumers make decisions. With this clear bias of mine in mind, this isn't a bad book. Ariely at least gives full credit to Tversky and Kahneman's influence on his work (both psychologists), and he describes his experiments in clear, easy-to-understand language for the non-scientist reader. The big ""however"" with this book is Ariely's tendency to extrapolate beyond the results of his studies with recommendations concerning public policy and personal solutions for individuals. Not that his advice is necessarily wrong, but it should always be made clear where the data stop and the personal advice begins. I would recommend this book to my non-social psychologist friends. My notes and quotes:Ariely is a behavioral economist from Israel. Much of his work is closely related to Tversky and Kanneman’s work, although he has taken it in many new directions, but it is usually related to consumer behavior in some way. *** He describes how money is often the most expensive way to motivate people. Instead, he suggests using social norms to do so. But he also warns the rules are different when you enter social norms into a relationship as opposed to market norms. The same rules that you use in relationships apply rather than the financial assessment of how much certain behaviors are worth. So if a business tries to develop social norms to increase productivity, they can’t all of a sudden introduce market norms without expecting a decrease in loyalty, etc. *** He spends some time talking about the influence of arousal on decision making, or specifically how we believe we will make a particular decision when in cold, rational states than we end up making when we are highly aroused. His specific studies have examined sexual decision making and how people are more than twice as likely to rate their likelihood of engaging in various sexual behaviors as high when they are aroused vs. when they are not. This is highly relevant to things like abstinence training programs and even safe sex programs. The best prevention is to prevent the high level of arousal or the opportunity in the first place, but if arousal does occur to make sure people are trained to have what they need available “just in case”. The same principles apply for the faulty predictions of how we would behave under any emotional or motivational state, such as hunger. Another example is pregnant women not wanting to use pain medication during birth. They make the decision beforehand, but often change their mind once the pain begins because they cannot predict how they will feel during that state. One technique he offers to test this is to have a woman hold her hand into a bucket of ice for two minutes while practicing her breathing. If she is able to handle it without trouble she might be able to handle childbirth more reasonably. *** His next section concerns procrastination and various methods of dealing with it. He divided his class into three sections, one where they got to pick their own deadlines, but once they were chosen they were firm; one where the deadlines were firmly established by the instructor; and one where there were no deadlines, they just had to submit their papers by the end of the quarter. The forced deadlines condition did best, the ones who chose their own deadlines did second, and the no deadlines condition performed the worst on the paper. He suggests the development of more external controls that we can select to prevent us from having to face temptation (to procrastinate, to spend, etc.) in the first place. By setting up our own deadlines/goals that are set in stone, we can head off our self regulation tendencies and just follow the designated structure. *** His next section relates to when and why people cheat. He found that for many tasks where people are unsupervised, they fail to cheat as much as they possibly can, even when no one will find out, but they almost always cheat a little. This is because in small circumstances like that people don’t really consider what they are doing as wrong. In other words, small infractions don’t typically bring to mind codes of conduct we have available for moral decisions. Instead they just sweep the transgression under the rug without thinking about it. But if people were reminded of a moral code (like the 10 commandments) they wouldn’t cheat at all. The key is to make morality accessible so that the decision will be framed in moral terms. He also suggests oaths and guilds might make ethics in business more likely because people would frame their decisions more on the code of conduct of their organization/profession instead of not really thinking about it. *** He continues on with his cheating work, but extends it to the difference between cash and non-cash currencies. When people are playing a game for cash they are much more likely to tell the truth about how much they earned (because the cash is a concrete reminder of how important the decision is) compared to when they play the game for tokens or credit of some kind. The problem is that people think there decisions are always made based on the same moral code regardless of the form of money they use. But in reality, the more concrete and meaningful a currency is, the more likely we are to frame our decisions in terms of market norms, and moral judgment. Some of the examples for non-monetary transactions are wardrobing or returning clothes after wearing them once; expense reports; taxes; insurance overestimations; or stealing anything that isn’t directly related to cash in general. *** He ends his book with a website for his book (www.predictablyirrational.com), and mentions that you can sign up for one of his studies from the site. "
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"All classic economic theories are based on the assumption that consumers behave rationally, despite a considerable body of evidence to the contrary. It is only in the last 25 years that economists have begun to investigate the irrational side of consumer behavior. This field of investigation, which started with the pioneering work of Tversky and Kahneman, is usually referred to as  behavioral economics. Dan Ariely's book, ""Predictably Irrational"", offers a clear and comprehensive overview of this fascinating subject. If you are the kind of person (like me) who can't imagine using the words 'fascinating' and 'economics' in the same sentence, don't worry, the primary focus of the book is human behavior and its peculiarities, rather than economic theory. In particular, the author is concerned with elucidating how and why people continue to engage in behavior patterns that are detrimental in the long term.In thirteen well-written chapters, Ariely considers such topics as:•	The effect of our need for a reference point before we can judge the value of something, and how clever marketers can exploit this•	How we can become trapped by our own behavior - the importance of first decisions•	How the prospect of getting something free can override reason and logic (is it really smart to wait for free-entrance night at the museum?)•	The effect of social norms (why you are more likely to agree to help your local charity by working for nothing, than for a quarter of your normal professional rate) •	The influence of arousal (we behave irrationally in the throes of passion - what you can do about it)•	The problems of procrastination and self-control•	Our tendency to place too much value on what we already own•	The destructive consequences of people's tendency to want to keep as many options open for as long as possible•	How our expectations of something can actually influence our ability to enjoy it•	The power of price (response to a $2.50 placebo is better than that to a 10c placebo)•	In what situations are people particularly likely to behave dishonestly? How can the triggers for dishonest behavior be disarmed?The book is based primarily on work that Ariely has done with colleagues at M.I.T. and elsewhere. Two features make the book exceptional, in my opinion:The ability of Ariely and colleagues to devise really neat experiments to test their hypotheses. All of the conclusions in the book are convincingly supported by often remarkably clever experiments.Ariely does an extraordinary job of making his material interesting and accessible to a general audience. The book was a joy to read.I highly recommend ""Predictably Irrational"". "
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Yet another book I'm recommending to Goodreads staff. I will write up a long review when it's done, but I think this is worth chewing on:According to the author of Predictably Irrational, we live simultaneous in the world of social norms and the world of market norms. Social norms are the exchanges and requests we make as part of personal connections. Market norms are the dollar-defined exchanges of dollars, wages, rents, prices. Here's where it gets interesting: ""In the lasts few decades, companies have tried to market themselves as social companions--that is, they'd like us to think that they and we are family, or at least are friends that live on the same cul-de-sac. ""Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there"" is one familiar slogan... Whoever started the movement to treat customers socially had a great idea. If customers and a company are family, then the company gets several benefits. Loyalty is paramount. Minor infractions--screwing up your bill and even imposing a modest hike in your insurance rates--are accommodated. Relationships of course have ups and downs, but overall they're a pretty good thing.But here's what I find strange: although companies have poured billions of dollars into marketing and advertising to create social relationships--or at least an impression of social relationships--they don't seem to understand the nature of the social relationship, and in particular, it's risks.For example, what happens when a customer's check bounces? If the relationship is based on market norms, the bank charges a fee and the customer shakes it off. Business is business... In a social relationship, however, a hefty late fee--rather than a friendly call from the manager or an automatic fee waver--is not only a relationship-killer; it's a stab in the back. Consumers will take personal offense. They'll leave the bank angry and spend hours complaining to their friends about this awful bank. After all, this was a relationship framed as a social exchange."" No parallels to Goodreads here. Say you have a site that framed itself in social terms. Then when you start applying business decisions to the social sphere, you get surprised that those docile consumers who devoted hours and years to database building (for social rewards) get pissed off and leave to a new site. No parallels at all.Full review and analysis at:http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/1..."

The examples in the book suggests that `The Neo Cortex` is such a funny dude that tricks us into thinking that we are making logical decision, that we are rational beings. In the meanwhile the other machinery that actually makes and executes the decision is pulling our strings. As stated in the book, we are a true Jeckll and Hyde dilemma. Very funny and the joke is on us."

The difference between 0 and 1 is just as large as the gap between 9 and 10, but it feels much more significant. We might drive out of our way to get a $15 meal for free, but we won't make that same drive to save $15 on a $500 coat.Ch4:Social norms vs. Market norms. People will do a good job for free, or for a good salary, but not for a lousy salary. Living a life based on social norms can be more fulfilling.Ch5: The influence of arousal. When we are calm and rational we fail to be capable of predicting how we will act when we are instead hot and emotional. Dr. Jekyll may imagine when the time comes he will be able to control his Mr. Hyde, but perhaps it would be better to plan ahead for the irrational emotional state (having a condom on hand for instance).Ch6: Procrastination & Self Control. Use the power of precommitment to reign in your future self. In a classroom setting students do better when given explicit due dates for their assignments (or even when they choose them themselves) than if they can put it all off to the end of the semester.Ch7: The high price of ownership. We value things more once we own them than before. This is related to our intrinsic loss aversion. ex: Final Four ticket holders valued their tickets in the thousands, while potential buyers only considered paying $100-$200, even though they were pulled fromt the same original pull.This idea of ownership and loss aversion also applies to ideas. Once we learn a particular ""fact"" about economics, for example, we are not prone to let go of it even if it is shown to be wrong.Ch8: Keeping Doors OpenIf we have too many options available, we may delay or be inactive which can lead to greater losses than if we had just chosen the ""weaker"" of our options. The differences between our choices are often negligible and we don't take into account the cost of not deciding. It is vital to begin shutting doors when we are overwhelmed with choice.Ch9: The effect of expectationsSo much of what we like or dislike is based on preconceived notions. If we want something mundane to taste exciting, throw an ""exotic"" ingredient into the description. Our expectations based on previous life experience color pretty much everything we come into contact with.(Beer with vinegar in it: If you're told ahead of time, it was not liked at all. If told after, it was enjoyed much more.Asian women do better on math tests if they are primed with questions about their race than if primed with questions about their gender)Ch10: The Power of PriceHigher priced pain medication works better than cheap pain medication. The effect goes beyond pain medication as well.Also, more things should be placebo tested.CH11: The Context of our Character pt1People will cheat a little when given the chance. The amount they cheat will not necessarily increase as the chance of getting caught decreases. If people are reminded of the idea of honesty through and ethics code or something before a test they do not cheat.CH12: The Context of our Character pt2We adhere to a certain level of honesty when it comes to cash. But nonmonetary abstractions can make us dishonest cheats. We may not take $1 sitting on top of someone's desk, but many will take one of their cokes from the breakroom fridge with few qualms. We just view money differently.This has huge implications when you think of how business' use nonmonetary abstractions (think frequent flyer miles and the crazy fiscal abstractions on wall street)CH13: Beer and Free lunchesbehavioral economics takes into account human irrationality while standard economics assumes humans maximize assumes people are rational actors maximizing their happiness and costs in accordance with their preferences.The irrationalities illustrated in this book don't mean we are stupid or weak minded. It's like a visual puzzle. You may KNOW that image A is the same size as image B, but you can't deny image B LOOKS bigger.We should take irrationalities into account and PLAN for them."
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736708-darin,2,"Ariely is a good writer whose book catches onto the _Freakonomics_ craze by taking a look at times when people make different decisions that typical ""laissez faire"" economic theories would expect. His book is a fairly easy read and does include some surprising results through social-science experimentation. However, the text is not without its flaws. For instance, some of the breathlessly-reported ""surprising"" results aren't all that surprising or even controversial. For instance, the effect of a ""free"" item on consumer decision-making is vastly overstated as irrational. This idea is old-hat to most and doesn't make much of a point. More troubling, however, is the unstated difference between this brand of social science and pure economics, and the author states such at the end of the text: the ultimate goal of such discovery is to alter and market certain things that are ""beneficial"" to most people into ""free lunches"" which are irresistable to the average Joe. Here is where pure economics gets it right: there is no such thing as a ""free lunch"", no matter what social economics claims. The buck always stops somewhere. If people are going to make ""better"" decisions about things, someone somewhere is going to decide what ""better"" is. And if someone else is deciding the terms of this ""better"", it no longer falls on the individual to do so. It is true that human beings cannot always be protected from themselves. If this is true, then this is tenfold true for random human beings (usually via government nannyism) who force ""better"" upon all people, rational or otherwise. Ariely never tries to face this dilemna, and it weakens the conclusion of the book considerably. This is an entertaining read, and worth your time as a second or third go at _Freakonomics_-like thought, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original."

The author is a professor who was injured in an explosion in Israel. He suffered severe burns and 5 years of therapy. He used this ""down time"" to ponder the why's and how come's of life. Using many experiments he (and others) tested the moral aptitude and other aspects of human behavior. Each chapter has several experiments that pertain to a topic. Chapter 1: The Truth about Relativity: Why Everything is Relative--Even When It Shouldn't BeThe author uses an example of shopping for a house in another part of the United States. He says, people accustomed to their own housing market set a mental ""anchor"" and expect to pay a similar price for a home elsewhere. Relativity. However, if a person were to rent a home in their new location, they--eventually--adapt to the higher prices and will not be so sticker shocked. Chapter 2: The Fallacy of Supply and Demand: Why the Price of Pearls--and Everything Else--Is Up in the AirInteresting, but true. The author uses black pearls as an example. When black pearls first came out businesses couldn't sell them. Had to market them by placing them in fine jewelry stores surrounded by diamonds and emeralds, place a high price on them, then people wanted them. He calls this ""arbitrary coherence."" Talked about how initial prices are arbitrary and can be influenced. So true!I thought it was interesting the way the author talked about stores who want to sell a certain, say t.v. It may not be the best that they have, but that is their target sell. They use three t.v.s, one very expensive, one middle of the road and one fairly inexpensive to test our mettle. Most will choose the middle of the road and that was the overall goal of the store. Chapter 3: The Cost of Zero Cost: Why We Often Pay Too Much When We Pay NothingInteresting. We all tend to have an idea of how much we should earn or how much a particular service should cost. The author calls this an ""anchor."" There was a master martial art instructor that gave free lessons. When the students asked to pay him, he told them he did it for free because they could not afford him if he charged. Another example was AARP asked a group of lawyers if they would be willing to provide legal services to some of their elderly members for $30 p/hour in lieu of their usual rate of $200 p/hour. The lawyers said, no. But when they were asked if they would do this service for free, they said yes. Why? Because they had it set in their minds what they were worth. Anchor.Chapter 4: The Cost of Social Norms: Why We Are Happy to Do Things, but Not When We are Paid to Do ThemThis chapter dealt with social norms and market norms and what happens when they collide. An example was a large family Thanksgiving dinner and a guest decided to pay the hostess $300 for the meal, she was offended. Why? Because he used a market norm ($) to pay for a social norm. When a bottle of wine would have been considered very gracious.Another example was if you ask a friend to help you move. They do it for free. But if you have the friend help you alongside a moving company that you are paying. That's a no-no.Chapter 5: The Influence of Arousal: Why Hot Is Much Hotter Than We RealizeWell, I'm going to sum this up by saying that men (they didn't use women because men could become aroused faster) that were masturbating were more likely to accept or do things (sexually) that they wouldn't consider in a calm(er) state of mind. Examples were: wearing condom, three somes, rape, etc.Little note that the author made a good point about the abstinence vs protection debate. Teens and people WILL not think clearly in a heightened state and thus do things they would not have done otherwise. Chapter 6: The Problem of Procrastination and Self-ControlHe taught classes and each class he told the students they had to submit 4 papers. One class got to decided their own due dates. They could select the last day of class, because that's when he would start grading them. They selected incremental dates. Another class he told to turn in 4 papers by the last day of class. They did the worst. Obvious they waited until the end to pull off those papers. Showed that we need to set limits to achieve goals. Whether dieting, saving, etc.Chapter 7: The High Price of Ownership: Why We Overvalue What We HaveSelf-ExplanatoryChapter 8: Keeping Doors Open: Why Options Distract Us from Our Main ObjectiveYikes! People hanging on to old loves, just in case, but dating new people. Several experiments that showed how we like to keep our options open in all aspects of our lives.Chapter 9: The Effect of Expectations: Why the Mind Gets What It ExpectsTalks about how previously held impressions can cloud our point of view. Did not care for the football analogy! We will pay more for the same coffee if served in a nice atmosphere. Interesting that he mentions how advertising a product can build a reputation for the product; thus, we are expected to like it better. I disagree. Books come to mind first. Movies second. Many times, movies the critics ripped apart, I enjoyed. Chapter 10: The Power of Price: Why a 50-Cent Aspirin Can Do What a Penny Aspirin Can'tWe expect the name brand product to work better than generic or store brand. Chapter 11: The Context of Our Character: Why We Are Dishonest, and What We Can Do About ItOaths of office from white collar professions and how they have degraded and why. Congress, lobbying, doctors accepting ""incentives"" to prescribe drugs. Interesting. Chapter 12: The Context of Our Character (part 2): Why Dealing with Cash Makes Us More HonestWe tend to be willing to steal a pen from our place of employment, but not money from the petty cash to go buy a pen. Talked about the recent ""police blotter"" newspapers with business scandals.Chapter 13: Beer and Free Lunches: What Is Behavioral Economics, and Where Are the Free Lunches?Overall, I enjoyed this book. Felt the author spent too much time explaining in too much detail his experiments, though. Could have been summed up faster. He tended the ramble. Sorry. However, the ideas presented were interesting. Did not agree with the author's idea to help us curb our spending habits, though. He suggests we agree to spend x amount on certain things p/month and when the debit/credit card shows that x amount is exceeded there would be consequences. No wonder the bank never called him back.Liked his idea to help with our health care. He felt doctors should provide incentives to health prevention. For instance, have a patient submit a $100 or $200 deposit for a cholesterol screening that they get back when they make the appointment. Interesting because prevention can be a major key in cutting health costs."

The most important lesson I learned from Ariely is the high cost of free. The biggest example is ""free shipping."" Companies only offer you free shipping to convince you to spend at least the minimum amount to get it. Something to think about the next time I shop online.Many of Ariely's lessons on psychology were already explained to me in previous books, but that isn't a strike against him. It just shows that maybe humans aren't as difficult to figure out as we would like to think."

When I was studying psychology one of my favorite topics was judgment and decision-making, which dealt in large part with the kinks in the human mind that could lead us to irrational behavior and decisions. Why are you likely to pay more for something if you are shown a large number completely unrelated to the price? Why do people who read words like ""elderly,"" ""decrepit,"" or ""senior"" tend to walk more slowly when they get up and leave the room? Why does losing a dollar cause us more pain than gaining a dollar gives us pleasure? Why are we more likely to buy a product we're not even shopping for or don't even need if we're given a free sample? And, perhaps most importantly, how do people in the know --people like advertisers, politicians, and psychology graduate students-- use these ideosycracities to subtly manipulate us?These are the kinds of questions that Ariely, a professor at MIT, discusses under the rubric of ""behavioral economics."" Each chapter is dedicated to a particular concept, like the anchoring effect, priming, social norms, supply and demand, procrastination, loss avoidance, the effects of price on perception, and the like. Ariely usually chats you up a bit about the concept, then walks you through a scenario or hypothetical situation that invites you to make predictions about human behavior, then comes at you with some findings from scientific research (often experiments that he's done himself) that turns your assumptions on their little figurative ears.Ariely's style is great --conversational, to the point, made relevant to some part of your life, and easy to follow despite navigating some tricky twists of the human psyche. And it's not just dry recitations of clinical psychology experiments --everything talked about here is ensconced in everyday life. For example, this book should win some award for describing some fascinating research on the effects of sexual arousal on decision making. Let's just say that it involved naughty pictures, experimenter issued laptops covered in protective Seran Wrap, and answering some very odd questions while in the throes of ...well, you know. I'm now more disappointed than ever that all of my extra credit in college psychology classes was never earned from anything so interesting. I just had to look at ink blots and fill out the MMPI over and over again.Really, anyone with even an ounce of curiosity about how the human mind works --or fails to work-- within the context of every day life should find a lot of fascinating material in this book. You should definitely pick it up. And then, preferably, read it."

For one, it is less economics and more behavioral psychology (this would be considered good or bad depending on your expectations though). Two, about 50% of the experiments that the Author carries out and talks about at length in the book are fascinating and eye-opening. The rest of them, not so much. Three, the book makes you realize how complex human beings are, how the behavioral and emotional complexity makes us both more and less reasonable, both more and less predictable and hence effectively vulnerable as compared to the 'rational thinking human being' that was envisioned in classical economics. The good :- Chapter about why and how we repeatedly choose middle path given several options.- Clever decoys in marketing pertaining to ""free stuff""- Social norms vs market norms and how deceptively it affects us all !The bad:- Over-generalized, far-reaching conclusions based on small sample sizes. This was actually my pet-peeve with Freakonomics as well. I understand that it is very difficult for Behavioral Economists to run experiments on people from different cultures, different ethnicities and different countries. But ""behavior"" I believe, is tied somewhat closely to one's culture, upbringing, where they currently reside & work etc. What is ""normal/rational"" for an American consumer might be very different than what is normal for an Indian consumer - even though both have equal buying power. Overall, I would say Predictably Irrational is an insightful read. Not quite great, but good nonetheless. 4/5 from me."
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1011143-matta,4,"A thought-provoking book on behavioral economics. Why do we make the choices that we do? What is our motivation? Why are seemingly irrational choices made over and over? The author's natural, readable style allows the laymen easy access to his academic research and the conclusions he draws on these topics. I especially liked the author's basic emprical approach. There isn't hardly a proposition or theory in the book that hasn't been tested via experiment.I don't agree that everything the author presents as ""irrational"" is actually ""irrational."" What does ""irrational"" mean, anyway? In the introduction, the author casts irrationality as ""distance from perfection."" To me that definition doesn't fit. Just because you aren't making perfect choices, doesn't make you irrational. It may mean that you simply lack perfect information about your situation or about the final outcome stemming from your choices. Or it may mean that the economist studying the situation (and judging things to be irrational) simply doesn't understand all of the costs and benefits being considered by the consumer. If a researcher doesn't fully understand what motivates a person, how can he consider them ""irrational?""Or it could mean that the economist isn't using the right tool to judge the behavior. I especially dug into the third chapter, on ""The Cost of Zero Cost."" I think if the author had analyzed that chapter's examples in terms of benefit/cost ratio rather than absolute benefit, then the consumer behavior described would make a lot more sense.Toward the end of the book, however, the author started digging into topics that did start to cut closer to the irrational, specifically on the topic of dishonesty. Via a variety of experiments the author shows how people's honesty can be nudged this way or that way by exposing them to different conditioning (like being told to think about the Ten Commandments before a test). Or how people are more likely to steal things rather than money, even if the value of the money matches the value of the item being stolen. The book demonstrates how stark economic assessments of cost and benefit can be fundamentally different from the way people actually view the world. In the end I found this a readable and captivating book. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in ""popular economics"", if you will. If you liked ""The Undercover Economist"" you'll probably like this book too."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"As you can tell from the title, this book gives us a needed reality check when it comes to our belief that we are making rational decisions. Ariely writes engagingly and informatively about the various unwitting errors we make, from finding an option more attractive simply because of its proximity to a less attractive version of it (note to realtors: if you want to sell someone a particular house, show the prospective buyers a similar and slightly inferior one) to overvaluing something because we own it, to self-fulfilling prophecies, and more. These errors are illustrated by a variety of entertaining examples from both experimental research and personal experience. I know I could relate to a whole lot of them, and I would guess others can as well.My one gripe is that, in a few situations, I felt Ariely failed to consider alternate explanations for his findings. Certainly people's behavior in the experiments was intriguing; at the same time, I was not necessarily convinced that Ariely's understanding of their motivations was necessarily the correct one.Still, this was a fun and provocative read, stimulating without being overwhelming. I realize there are several popular books out there on this topic but if you haven't read any of them yet, this one is worth checking out."

23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398087-mike,1,"Oh God, what shit. Where to begin?The simplest start is to take issue with the premise, which is simply that the model of a 'rational actor' as defined in classical economics is ridiculous for two reasons: one because of how irrational we are naturally, but also that the degree of our irrationality is so pervasive as to be testable and demonstrable in a way that studies that prove it are easily replicated. This is good. Data replication is crucial. It's a shame that this stubborn notion of a 'rational actor' hasn't been obliterated in even current debate among economics experts, NYT op/ed hacks, and sweat-smeared pundits, but it still doesn't help Dan Ariely's trainwreck from being an overblown straw-man argument against an obvious case. Of course a rudimentary concept such as the rational actor being found along two hypothetical straight lines doesn't encompass human experience. If you're going to make this obvious point, do it in a way that's convincing with data from which it is safe to extrapolate. Dan Ariely fails on these accounts and more.Oddly, let's start with the more: his total ineptitude for obvious answers that lie within the sociological disciplines. He seems baffled by how white-collar crime is seen as sterile and ineffectual, though more catastrophic, than violent, petty robbery or vandalism against property. Why is this, he says? He talks about how the process of mediation - how having proxies around money stand in for money - changes how we perceive cheating or theft. This misses the point. People still see vandalism and petty theft - of property, not money itself, mind you - as more dreadful or lowly, and worthy of incarceration, than the greed that devastated a global economy. In his discussion he omits any mention of racism and classism: could it be that we condemn petty theft because it's the symptom of a subordinate class being oppressed to the point of desperation? Could it be that it's because the ""war on crime"" was so racially coded and abetted thanks to COPS (the show and the over-militarized killers) and distorting media imagery that the mental image of a burglar that is conjured in the public imagination is that of a young Black male? Not to mention our contempt for what we are as poor as opposed to the kind of unfettered prosperity we desire as rich. These are low-hanging fruit answers Ariely missed the boat on completely, and it's downright stupid that he missed them.Now a brief word about his sexist bullshit. Take page 77, wherein he takes the case of a man being frustrated that he's taken a woman out to dinner with no sex in exchange. He casually mentions that after four dinners he ought to get something out of it, right? ""He should have known that one can't mix social and market norms - especially in this case - without implying that the lady is a tramp. He should also have remembered the immortal words of Woody Allen: 'The most expensive sex is free sex.'"" Not only is he quoting the most inappropriate mentor for sexual counsel imaginable, but look at how he misses the point of pervasive sexism here. What are the forces at play that make dinner with another woman not its own reward? Why with such flippance is it okay to make the man the one with agency here and blame his mistake on the blending of norms? Isn't it also about seeing women as more than sexual property, as perhaps a human being? For anyone remotely awake to how the patriarchy functions, it's a miserable omission and an astoundingly tone-deaf example in a book rife with them.His example for fixing employment disillusionment on page 90 is about incorporating more social norms into workplace environments: and while I agree that health insurance coverage should be a part of the mix, he's amazed at how start-up companies are getting so much productivity out of employees (91). Yet the tide is turning: start-ups are garnering bad reputations for the burnout its staff experience, and are ridiculed for the absurd perks and ping-pong tables that they put into their offices in its wake. Nowhere in this discussion of enhancing quality of life is the mere mention of work-life balance, collective bargaining, fair and equitable pay, &c. It's about how manipulating social norms can entrap labor in a contract they may be too scared to leave. Except they're not really: it's no wonder start-ups have such high turnover.There are glaring issues with his extrapolations from his cutesy studies, though. So many that I can't possibly list them all here. For example, Ariely concludes that students become more conscious of not being selfish maximizers when chocolates are free to take as opposed to one or two pennies to take. When they are cheap, people don't consider the supply for someone else. Yet this conclusion is then meant to show why carbon cap-and-trade policies are a bad idea. In what world can chocolate - a mostly unnecessary, inexpensive, and far-from-scarce good - as consumed by privileged college students become an indicator of international macroeconomic policy meant on saving life as we know it? Why not look at oil instead? His case is weak especially since he relies on rational economic models that he wishes to debunk in order to support his claim here: a company ""might well decide, after a cost-benefit analysis, that it can go ahead and pollute a lot more"" (115). It's weird for Ariely to reincorporate cost-benefit analyses as tried-and-true metrics considering how irrational those analyses might be according to his own findings, but no matter: his ""better"" solution is to ""make pollution into an easily measurable and observable quantity and get people to pay attention to it and understand its importance"" by ""publically posting the pollutant amounts of different countries, states, and companies together"" (116). This is demonstrably failing. The United States has ""elected"" a leader who believes climate change is a hoax concocted by the Chinese. The United States feels so little of the shame Ariely expects it to feel for being so obstinately non-committal to climate change resolution after climate change resolution that to imbue any sense of optimism into it feels naive beyond belief. The gargantuan body of literature confirming climate change as a phenomenon, and the cornucopia of reports verifying it, not to mention the increase of natural disasters occurring before our very eyes, has done little to get people to pay attention to it and understand its importance. This is in part because of the irrational parts of human nature that Ariely should understand well enough to know his proposal is stupid. Another part is his models are not comprehensive enough to capture the entirety of backfire effects, political dealings, propaganda manufacturing, and political tweaking. Nor does he account for the fact that his discussion of market failures - in this case, ""externalities"" - is a classical doctrine that better accounts for the phenomenon he's describing as a behavioral economist. The list of disasters goes on and on: he studies only men to make a judgment about all people in the chapter ""The Influence on Arousal."" There's a huge fallacy in his methodology in this chapter: he asks people when not sexually aroused what they would do if aroused. Then he arouses them and asks them what they would do when sexually aroused. His conclusion? That people who are sexually aroused would be more likely to cheat, sexually assault, have sex with older women and even an animal, and therefore we are bad indicators of gauging how we'll act when we're aroused. But wait a second. In order for this to be true, Ariely would have to prove that when people are sexually aroused, they are good gauges for what they will do when they are sexually aroused. The only evidence he has presented is that these people self-reported while they were aroused that they would be more willing to perform these things. But what if people are bad at judging what they'd do when they're aroused...both while they're aroused and when not? If we're interested in measuring actual behavior when aroused, perhaps it's best to measure actual behavior when aroused, not responses to hypothetical questions while aroused. I don't understand why he would say our judgment gets more cloudy and impulsive while we are aroused, but doesn't extend that principle to say our judgment gets more cloudy and impulsive while answering surveys or doing experiments while aroused. At best he can say that people are bad judges - when not aroused - of how they'll self-report their hypothetical behavior when aroused, but that's all he's proven. He has not proven with his evidence any change in actual conduct. He makes the embarrassing example of how it's because of ""the heat of passion"" and its interplay with our irrational psyche that ""a priest rapes a boy"" (128). So much for the long-established notion that rape is about power, power, power. He would rather teach adolescents to say no before any arousal or temptation takes hold than challenge the assumption that teenagers should avoid sex, which is hypocritical of him since later in the book he asks us why we don't model our policies after how people actually behave rather than how they should (317). If we modeled our policies after how teenagers actually behaved when dealt abstinence-only or anti-coveting education, well, we'd end up in the disaster we're in. Good thing we're not following Dan Ariely's advice on one instance, and following his advice about how to model policies based on actual behavior in another. Which Dan Ariely do I like or dislike?Also how did he get a study where he painfully shocks people past an institutional review board? The answer is he probably didn't, and he's fabricating a study. I hope this does not bear repeating.It doesn't help that he's a creep that lets a student confide in him to somewhat revolting effect (186) or that his protocols for better behavior address only those with comfortable incomes at prestigious universities (no way to split those bills the way you want, Dan, if you're broke and don't go out with the same people to the same fancy restaurant every week). He quotes Skinner and Freud, both of whom have been widely debunked. His ""vanishing doors"" example (194-195) eludes the more viable concept of choice paralysis, as well as totally misses the point that the situation presented is no surrogate for real life. Any vanishing door will have variable benefits to it in real life, therefore the study is a chronicle of perfectly rational risk aversion, not irrationality. Every study in here is a failure in what happens when we try to assess human behavior with a limited demographic in a limited space without any of the appropriate context that human life functions within. But wait, there's more! Ariely somehow believes that patients' self-assessments of their own pain should be taken at face value (227) even though pain is notoriously difficult to capture, empathize with, and measure across people. Nor is there any mention of how human beings might not be fully honest about telling medical professionals how successful treatment was, in part because they may be shy about telling the professional the treatment failed, they may want to believe so much that they feel better that they say so in a survey to try to convince themselves, that they say they're fine out of sheer denial, or any other innumerable complexities that go into why a person might not be fully honest when they disclose they feel better to a professional (oh, let's not forget the power dynamic often enshrined within that exchange) that should be controlled for or accounted for beyond being swept into a ""placebo effect"" umbrella. The book is so reductive it's nauseating. And when it's not making outlandish and uninformed claims like ""Before recent times, almost all medicines were placebos"" (229) it's just repetitive dreck. I guess he didn't know that some ""non-recent times"" medicines worked because, oh let's see, willow bark actually has aspirin in it, for fucking example.I'm not even close to done with how much garbage there is in this book. Just ugh. Fucking ugh."
24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/608861-laura,4,"There’s a generalization that people make that really gets me. It’s the idea that people naturally prefer or practice competition over collaboration or cooperation. Usually this is said as a way to dismiss addressing inequalities in America and to explain why capitalism is the only choice. Socialism or any hybrid economic system is doomed. Doomed! There are several reasons the acceptance of individual competition over striving for the group’s overall well-being seems to be a social norm rather than an innate human trait. And even if it was an innate human trait, I believe we can rise above it. While working together is a shared value in my family, living in Japan showed me it could be a bigger social norm. There are other reasons I question the all-out assumption that competition trumps collaboration, but let’s go with those two. When I picked up Predictably Irrational, I was worried that the book was going to give me absolute arguments similar to the one I outlined above. It’s the way it is because people practice it that way. Instead, I believe if I brought this observation to Ariely he would say something like: Why do you think that is? How are the innate human traits reinforced by society to make something more commonly practiced? Ariely describes his interest in understanding people's behavior in groups based on a fire accident. Ariely suffered third degree burns from an explosion. The recovery period isolated Ariely. And that isolation brought him a new perception of people. I believe that it can also happen when you live in another country. Living in Japan, I frequently felt separate from those around me. And while my feelings of isolation were not as deep as Ariely, there were many occasions where I felt like I was observing people around me with new eyes. In other words, I take Ariely to be the kind of person who could acknowledge that people are both competitive and collaborative. And he would be equally interested in what social norms brought out one behavior more so than the other. That said – his tests (usually of MIT, Harvard or Stanford students) often left me with more questions. For example when given three choices – with one being a decoy choice – 75% of students took the bait and chose the one researchers wanted them to choose. And I would think – what’s happening with that other 25%. Because in my mind – 25% is still a lot of people. What were they thinking? Another section discusses how people see themselves as mostly honest. When given the opportunity to cheat, they mostly self-regulate even with intentional leeway to cheat more and not get caught. However the further people are from money the more likely they are to cheat. For example, if you take an expense account and have a procedure of receipts and involve another person (an assistant who submits them), these buffers (from the actual cash) lead to a situation where people are more likely to cheat on their expense accounts. In July 2010, my house was flooded. I experienced five feet of water in my basement. FEMA and then later the SBA visited me. And there was a procedure much like Ariely describes. If anything, I underestimated the cost of the damages. This may be because I was warned that if I was found to be lying, I would have to return the money. But at several times I was encouraged to really be sure that I was certain of my reporting because the estimate could go down, but it could never go up. And I should include things that could later be taken out. Perhaps those conversations were a bit like signing an honesty code. However, I do the same thing – underreport my expenses – with my expense account at work. Perhaps that's just me being part of the (figurative) 25%. What I appreciate about Ariely’s presentation of research is that he doesn't box himself into saying this is the way humans behave. Rather – if you consider these conditions – asking people to sign an honor code – you encourage this kind of behavior – greater rates of honesty. "

I don’t think there was a single circumstance in Ariely’s book I wasn’t already aware of from one experiment or another, one summary or another. That said, Predictably Irrational is well written and easy to digest; there’s no technobabble, and everything is presented in a very readable and readily understandable format. It’s not Dan Ariely’s fault that I’ve read all this stuff before.If you don’t know much about the topic of the way our brains work, and how counter-intuitive it sometimes is, then this is a good place to start. Unfortunately, that means I don’t have much to say about it — it didn’t hold any surprises for me.Originally posted here."

This follows the same well-worn path of Sway, Freakonomics, and Blink, and after having read those, there wasn't a lot new here.Yes, humans see credit differently than cash. Ariely uses that premise to show how easy it is for companies such as Enron to steal vast sums without feeling the same as a mugger taking money from an old lady's purse, despite the end result being the same.People are influenced by brand names and logos, and knowing that it is a Coke you are drinking changes the amount of pleasure you get from your beverage than if you are having an anonymous cola. This affects our response to drugs as well. If we think we are taking a pricey pill, we will feel better than if we are told we are taking a cheap aspirin, even if it's the same pill.It's interesting, and certainly is a quick and easy read. But Ariely falls short in trying to come up with solutions to these failings. Instead of giving us tactics to fight off overusing our credit cards, he proposes that credit card companies produce a card with built-in limits. As that would limit the use of the card by consumers, it's unlikely the companies would be interested in such a card.In the meantime, we are left with our irrational impulses to deal with. I guess we have been informed of them, which is something. If you haven't already read a bunch of these books, this is worth a read. Otherwise, it's more of the same, and you can skip it."

I just find it amusing that MIT classifies him as a behavioral economist when in any other university he'd be a member of the psychology department (like the other academics whose work he cites). On a somewhat tangential note, he lists the Ten Commandments in an appendix (after noting a study on how listing as many as you can remember impacts subjects' honesty in a task afterwards). I had no idea that coveting my neighbor's wife and adultery counted as separate commandments, or that coveting my neighbor's property and stealing were also given separate listings. Shouldn't it really be the Eight Commandments? Or if we must have ten, let's include something about being a good parent and respecting Mother Nature, with some thou's thrown in for good form. "
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9808576-subrahmanyam-muramalla,4,"Short reviewReading this book may not make us more rational in our behavior. The least it does is to help us identify our abilities and inabilities. In short our limitations in a given context. Gradually with the awareness of our limitations, we can be relatively more rational. Be a better judge for others, since it is relatively easy to judge others and eventually a better person ourselves.DetailRelativity is everywhere and in everything. The other day I heard my cousin's(say John) wife saying that he doesn't spend much time with kids. She believes that his friend(say Abraham) would make a better husband from the few occasions she saw him being very playful with the kids. With the knowledge of few such occasions she confidently said that. If anyone wants to consider some more aspects that would rationalize John's and Abraham's behavior towards kids there will be so many such factors (following are few):1. The way they were brought up2. The schools they had been to3. Parent's financial conditions during their childhood4. Present financial conditions5. The time John's wife sits idle in a day (Coz I believe (male/female), the more time one is idle the more time one has to judge others and find faults with them. Considering we have li'l time too brings the same effect. Our inherent nature to conclude something quickly and simplify something does that).6. The time spent with John and the time spent with Abraham. ......... so on.. There is no end to the factors that can be listed out for consideration before a person judges the other. In law, they dismiss a case due to lack of evidence. Since no such evidences are not asked by near and dear during casual conversations, we don't mind judging someone with minimal comparison.Regarding anchoring effectsAnchoring is foremost factor that decides how we take decisions. To add to the book, I propose that we have anchors any given moment. Emotional, rational, physical..  Supposing you are along with your friends on your way to the dormitory. Friends have decided to complete an assignment regarding the college curriculum sitting late tonight right after dinner. Now you visited a restaurant for dinner and had a great time over there. It will take a good deal of time to calm yourself and sit down and build-up the concentration levels particularly after all the fun you had at dinner. Easily comprehensible instance would be the death of a loved one. For quite a few days you will not feel like having fun. Because the emotional anchors hour to hour during that time will be of a gloomy mood. Now gradually you start going out, not for entertainment. Anchors now gradually change until your routine becomes normal again. Watching your favorite shows, playing your favorite game. If suddenly someone takes the name of the deceased cousin, the anchor associated with that name and time will come into action and for next couple of mins there will shades of gloominess around you. Your talk and walk becomes slow, because those were the anchors related to your behavior taken your cousin's name. It might not be the same if the deceased is a distant cousin and you rarely met each other.Regarding Decision Making I don't think we can ever take a best decision regarding anything. We will be swayed away by the numerous anchors that we, 'at the moment', cannot identify individually and evaluate. Moreover we don't know what a best decision is like. The inherent whores we are, we don't mind getting bombarded (f***ed is the right word, since I'm very careful about my language!!) repeatedly if doing something (which we think is a small mistake) evokes positive emotions like joy and excitement. These are the anchors that decide what we personally mean and define things like 'FUN', 'LAUGHTER' etc., These anchors have long lasting effects, but we won't mind, we don't want to mind. When we don't want to mind, we won't mind anymore in fact, we can't mind.Individuals are honest only to the extent that suits themSupposing 'Mr. A' is a celebrity. Mr. A is sometimes referred to as Mr. Honest. If he were asked to share the most shameful act that he did during his childhood. He might limit his experiences to how he stole his big brother's fountain pen and later was beaten badly by his father or how he stole money from his Father's pocket etc., He, whoever he is, however honest he thinks he is most probably will not share instances where he voyeured his cousins taking bath, or how he hit his mother with a shoe in a fit of rage, how he used to grope for girls in a heavily crowded street activity and so on..  There's our inherent nature to please ourselves before we please others. We won't do anything that doesn't please us given a context. When we are sure that we don't get caught we will incline towards cheating.ConclusionPsychology/Behavioral Economics/Biology especially Neuro-sciences refer to each other and borrow theories for justifying certain behavioral patterns. In fact, boundaries of topics like Behavioral Economics, Philosophy, Psychology are not clearly drawn. The author meticulously used references to biology and to a minimum extent. Too much of that would disengage the reader. This is a book to be read repeatedly and referred to on occasions for better insights about our understanding of ourselves."

At that time I was so obsessed with a particular question that I enjoyed that book to the full. However, I read this one half-heartedly with a fleeting mind. That might have clouded my opinion about the book. Actually I'm not convinced. Nothing so extra-ordinary about this one - moulded as usual on popular behavioral economics books. I could relate to some of my own behavioral tendency. That was useful but people are also forgetful of useful knowledge :v  And as usual I didn't find what I was looking for .. Humans beings are so complex. I believe behavioral economics is a necessary approach to capture our mind, our behavior. Yet people can behave so differently from time to time. Sometimes I feel people can shed their skin. But still it appears, as the book also suggests, people tend to be predictably irrational again & again ... May be irrationality is wired deep inside this ideally-assumed rational species .."

This isn't to say that the topics handled are the same.ContentDan Ariely covers a pretty wide range of topics varying from the appeal of all things free to how 'good' and 'honest' people cheat when the cheating is just 'a little bit'. I enjoyed each topic and discussions a lot, not even a single topic failed to provide interesting insights.The author doesn't just stop at describing a behavioral trait. He goes one step ahead and discusses what one could do to avoid mistakes that this trait causes. The philosophy ""being aware of one's biases and failings is the first step to improvement"" appeals a lot to me and ""Predictably Irrational"" is choke-full of it.Appeal to meMany times I wonder about my behavior, I try to probe my motivations. I get very curious sometimes about why someone behaved in certain way, why people in general do the things they do. Then I get lazy and give up on thinking about it! Sometimes I just lack the clarity of thought that is required to do such introspection. The curiosity remains; but laziness prevails. ""Predictably Irrational"" gave me ready-made answers to many of those questions. Theories which make sense, explain so much and are backed by experimental results -- I find them to be a treat!Another aspect of this book which made me fall in love with it is the description of the experiments, how crucial it is to set up the right experiment, how it is important to distill the essence of a problem and turn it into the simplest experiment possible. It got me really interested in behavioral economics and I have decided to audit a few courses related to it while at Stanford."

In my opinion, studying human behavior is a fantastic gift because it helps us better understand ourselves and the daily mysteries we encounter. Although the topic is important and fascinating, it is not easy to study, and there is still a lot of work ahead of us. As the Nobel Laureate Murray Gell-Mann once said, ""Think how hard physics would be if particles could think.""
HA.We love grabbing FREE! stuff. But we don't devour the whole box of cookies that a friend offers to the group. We, mistakenly, believe that more expensive things are necessarily better (think milk powder price hike issue). And... admit it, we wouldn't steal cold hard cash but we might nick a pencil from the teacher's table for ""emergencies"".Like Nudge and Freakonomics, Predictably Irrational was a fascinating compilation of many social experiments that proved the standard economic theory wrong. This is probably my favourite of the three because the experiments were simple enough (anyone could replicate them), yet well-designed to tease out the motivations behind our irrational behaviours. Especially appreciated how Ariely tested one idea (e.g. our reaction to something with price = 0) under different experimental conditions (e.g. FREE! samples vs free cookies from a friend), which added depth and new perspectives to the discussion. Highly recommend!"

This is why we stop our car and four a.m. when we see a red light, even if we know that no one is around; and it is why we get a warm feeling when we return a lost wallet to its owner, even if our identity is never revealed.

40,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180470-natalia,2,"Reading this book in 2019 is like reading a quaint anachronism. The book's foundation rests on real life academic experiments analysing for example, decisions made by 19-year-olds at prestigious American universities and their preferences for variously priced Hershey's kisses - and then extrapolating that data as predictors for economic behaviors across race, class, age, geography, culture, and gender. (Also, the author uses unscientific personal experiences and anecdotes to explain human behavior.) Furthermore, even when the experiment results are revealed - there's no *there there.* When the author says, ""hey, these results would be great for, say, school board members or bankers to use! It's a shame that they won't use it!"" - he appears to have no self-awareness that the behavior of individuals in power is also not rational, and requires further study in and of itself. We now live in a world of exponentially complex Artificial Intelligence and data mining. Predictions of individual behavior can now be done in .000001 seconds. But quite purposefully, we aren't in charge of our own data. Perhaps, in order to ease human suffering and climate catastrophe, behavioral economists should spend more time and energy analysing the behavior of elites, tech executives, and politicians manipulating human behavior for their own greed and power - rather than the behavior of college students or poor people just getting by.

As a booster shot, to recharge my thinking in these areas, I picked up these books. They pretty much did the job; they are well-written in the language of the common person.Ms. Duke's work uses her experience as a gambler to shed light on ways to better thinking. Mr. Ariely takes a slightly more academic approach, yet creates a very readable work. Mr. Smith's first work, ""Standard Deviations"" is also quite useful.With respect to Mr. Smith's second work, ""What the Luck?"" I must take issue. Much of this volume is nearly a direct cut-and-paste from his first volume; yet, he provides no admission. In fact, the bibliography doesn't list his first book, though the earlier work is referenced on the book jacket. This situation seems a bit odd to me, perhaps a bit sly? Would Julia Child have been so bold to repeat recipes without acknowledgment?I'm left with the thought that for all our wonderment for the human brain, for all its capabilities, it is an organ with many, many flaws. Because influential agents understand these flaws, we are susceptible to both gross manipulation and errors in personal and group judgement; I know I sure have contributed more than my fair share, worse, I know I will continue to do so."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,4,"This book is the result of thorough research in the behavioral economics field; an amazing emerging field that combines economics with psychology, one of the best books about this topic I have read so far. Unlike traditional economics, behavioral economics proves that human beings’ decision making does not result from the naïve cognitive psychological claim of us being as rational and have full control of our actions. On the contrary, we are not the drivers of the car, our brains are wired in a way that our decision making is totally irrational. For example, if we were completely rational, why some of us do not have the money in our account we planned to save? Or why do we eat things we originally plan not to?Through 13 chapters, the author attempts to indicate our irrational impulses through a set of experiments which I really enjoyed reading, some are really funny. For example, one experiment tested our difference in decision making when we are sexually aroused. It turned out that our actions significantly differ under sexual arousal J Another one tests our dishonesty behavior as his findings indicate that we are prone to “steal” cans of coke available in the fridge but will not take available $1 cash amounts present in the kitchen. Another one that struck me was when Harvard students were given the opportunity to cheat, their likelihood of cheating decreases when they list what they remembered of the 10 commandments beforehand even if the commandments they remembered were not related to honesty matters.The main ideas behind the numerous experiments can be summarized as follows: Human beings need a prior knowledge or some “Anchor” to decide their expenditures on a certain item. If this anchor is not available, they will do whatever they can to get an idea of what to expect. The anchor concept is like when restaurants price high some dishes on the menu, knowing that you would not order them, however they offer the anchor as you would choose the less expensive item. Your brains anchored, however the only reason that super expensive dish is available is simply to market the dish you are going to order at a less expensive price. Same applies for that $200 bottle of wine which makes the $70 one totally affordable, however if you go to another restaurant and the same bottle of $70 is the highest listed one, you definitely will not purchase it. How irrational is thatJ. The author points out that this is a problem as this specific trick is how some people are making money, such as Starbucks that seized this psychological human “deficiency” as no one would ever pay $5 for a cup of coffee, however as Starbucks created this ambience, the customers did not how to anchor in an upscale environment, then the $5 becomes your new anchor for coffee. The coffee that costs $5 now makes you feel better than the one that costs less. Ariely shows us that this psychological anchoring is a temptation that, if we are able to recognize it, can be shaped with a comparative analysis in our mind, for example that $50 wine bottle, would the $15 make you just as happy? Easy in theory hard in practice, our brains are in automatic process of anchoring. The second concept that the author sheds the light on is expectations. In my restaurant example, the description of the ingredients of a dish in a menu like mouthwatering sauce flavored with a pinch of pepper engraved in etc. (like poetry) increases your expectations to form your experience and in fact helps you have a positive experience, a better one than if the ingredients are just listed (mushroom sauce with pepper). Expectations help us form experiences; therefore we ought to recognize when we are making decisions based on fear, we should think about how are expectations are.Finally, my favorite “Morality”, this concept can vary significantly in different contexts and outer forces. The example of the 10 commandments effect as decreasing the willingness to cheat, people are more honest in cash than in any other items because “cheating is a lot easier when it’s a step removed from money”. Our irrationality reasons that it’s okay to take a pen for your daughter from work but not okay to take $1 from the petty cash to buy your daughter a pen from the store close to work. Our irrationality reasons, that it’s okay to expense a gift on the account of the company when we are on a business trip from the airport but we wouldn’t do that in the airport of our home town. Moreover, an experiment showed that some people who believe in gender equality, fairness and safe sex, would not strongly believe so under sexual arousal. Ariely points out that we should decide beforehand on how we will behave before any temptation. Just like when we decide on a diet when we had a full meal and then break it when hunger strikes.As a conclusion, in my opinion and as an enthusiast of behavioral economics, this is a great book showing entertaining experiments, unpredictable research findings, and a great basis for behavioral economics. It contradicts the optimistic standard economics concepts, however, despite our irrationality, the predictability of our irrationality also offers insights of how to control your actions or at least understand your and others’ behavior. For learning, curiosity about people and also entertainment I highly recommend this book.Note about the author:First, about the author, he was born in NYC and moved with his family to occupied Palestine (Israel) when he was 3. He grew up there and he majored in physics and Mathematics in Tel Aviv University but then switched to psychology and philosophy because of an accident, the time he spent in the hospital made him observe how people are influenced (pain precedent) and then the field became his passion. He holds a PhD in cognitive psychology from the University of California and in business studies from Duke University. Currently, he is a professor at MIT Sloan School of management in the field of Behavioral Economics."
43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7000752-athens,1,"There are a number of positive aspects of this book to mention and there are some bad.GOODAriely comes up with a wide array of straightforward experiments with clear focus and nearly always enlightening results. This seems to be his forte.I appreciated learning why it is that we like to help each other for free, including strangers, but when offered money to help, we do not like to help and will more often decline to help.Impact of pricing on outcomes (actual and subjective) was particularly insightful.The section about the conflict at the intersection of social norms and market norms was fresh (to me) and interesting. The explanations used, both real experiments and thought experiments, were helpful.The primary thread, that classical economics expects us to be rational when we are not, seems to be something I've run across before. It appears to be a sound thesis backed up by a variety of demonstrated proofs. However (a) this is not really a new idea, is it? and (b) the idea does not, in and of itself overturn the corpus of classical economics, thereby ushering in a new dawn of human understanding. In my view, Ariely is right, irrational behavior does introduce variables, but there is likely a case to be made that the variables of irrationality tend in aggregate to have a self-canceling effect and (again my my personal guess) the net-net is that overall the macro models will not need more than a tweaking in almost every single case. ------------------BADTo capture the less-shining essence of this book in one short quote:""Safe Driving... Similarly, we need to teach teenagers (and everyone else) not to drive when their emotions are at a boil. It’s not just inexperience and hormones that make so many teenagers crash their own or their parents’ cars. It’s also the car full of laughing friends, with the CD player blaring at an adrenaline-pumping decibel level, and the driver’s right hand searching for the french fries or his girlfriend’s knee. Who’s thinking about risk in that situation?""If this works for you, by all means indulge yourself!From my view, this style is up on the trite-o-meter; too chatty and the content is, well, stuff people have known for decades... not what we want from an MIT prof. In too many spots, this package of text becomes a TEDx talk in written form, more than a book.  ------------------At one point, he recommends freezing credit cards in ice, as if that idea is new rather than 30 years old.------------------The idea that we are bio-programmed and bio-programmable and that these facts are foundational to the practice of influence is actually better done in ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" by Robert B. Cialdini. On many pages, the ones with substance, it felt like reading Cialdini, only with different illustrative stories.------------------The finding that people can be influenced by the psychological tactic of ""anchors"" is used to somehow prop up the idea that free markets are not fair. We need government to protect us against the dangers of being responsible. Here is some text:""ANOTHER IMPLICATION OF arbitrary coherence has to do with the claimed benefits of the free market and free trade. The basic idea of the free market is that if I have something that you value more than I do— let’s say a sofa— trading this item will benefit both of us. This means that the mutual benefit of trading rests on the assumption that all the players in the market know the value of what they have and the value of the things they are considering getting from the trade.""This is his launching point for ""we need more government"".*** I've not a clue where (or why) he gets that idea that mutual benefit rests on the assumption of perfect knowledge of value, or how he thinks that value is determined in full by forces or entities outside of your transaction. I have never ever heard that asserted by any philosopher or economist, nor does the assertion stand on its own merit.I would assert that the mutual benefit of trading rests instead on the assumption that we have freedom of choice over both our assets and our buying/selling decisions as adults who are responsible.-------------------Below, he completely errs in conflating greed and dishonesty. They are simply not the same thing! I can say from direct experience and regular practice that my greed does not necessitate dishonesty, much less are they the same thing. It's just horribly weak thinking to equate them. You could rightly reply that he inserts the clause about encouraging dishonesty, but in effect he equates, or in a sly way tries to create an equivalence that he knows is not really there, which is even worse.""Now suppose that you have a company or a division of a company led by a Gordon Gekko character who declares that “greed is good.” And suppose he used nonmonetary means of encouraging dishonesty. Can you see how such a swashbuckler could change the mind-set of people who in principle want to be honest and want to see themselves as honest, but also want to hold on to their jobs and get ahead in the world?""While the author generally seems to be a ""like-able guy"" and he has some strong points, this kind of thing just happens too much and we should expect better from anybody at this level.I'd recommend that anybody do go on YouTube and take note of what Gekko actually says in the ""Greed is Good"" talk. Listen to what examples he gives. Then watch Milton Friedman on Dick Cavett talking about greed."

45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"I'm impressed with the way in which the author has covered the entire theme of the book in its title. He couldn't have done a better job. These hidden forces influence almost every human on this planet. It has nothing to do with any nationality or ethnicity or race or gender. There were some which I found very intriguing because I've seen them unfold in front of my own eyesSuppose a friend invited you over for a dinner and at the end of the dinner, you were so impressed and satisfied with the hospitality that you offered him/her Rs 500 for her/his troubles. Would that the looked upon kindly or thoughtfully for that matter? I don't want to generalize here but I think that in more than 95% of the cases, it would be greeted with unpleasant expletives. The question which arises here is that why would anyone offer money at the end of the dinner? If you are thinking in those lines, great. Let me introduce you the concept of two parallel universes in which we live simultaneously:1)Social Paradigm: This consists of all the emotional exchanges that we enjoy in our day to day life. Sharing a smile with a stranger, hugging a friend, enjoying a meal with someone etc. The rules to be desirable in this paradigm consists of empathy, decency, simplicity and many other adjectives like that2) Market Paradigm: This consists of all the monetary interactions between two entities which can be individuals or any entity which is treated as an individual in the legal language. In this paradigm, you are being appreciated for being upfront as that helps to establish your credibility. If you would be paying money in time, your market image will be impeccable because that's desirable hereThe problem arises when we forget the rules of these 2 paradigms and apply one paradigm's rule into another. This might happen because there might be people who would be very good and comfortable in the rules of market paradigm or vice versa. Thus, in the above example, you social paradigm was on and you played by the rules of market paradigm expecting that you would be appreciated for the gesture but that didn't happen. I guess its pretty clear why it didn't happen as expected I have friends and relatives who are practicing as doctors. Time and again they tell me a very peculiar story that almost all of them have came across. There is a category of patients who come for treatment and are always insisting on vaccination. Most of the times they are suffering from something like common cold or any disease which can be treated by tablets or capsules. So many a times it happens that doctors inject saline water and send them home. Surprisingly enough, their situation miraculously improves and doctors wonder that what sorcery is this. Actually this sorcery is called placebo effect and there's also an opposite of this effect known as nocebo effect in which an individual doesn't get the desired feeling unless he/she goes through an experience which he/she has in his/her own mind regarding the situation. I used to wonder if these effects are applicable in the case of medication only, but now, the author has dispelled all of my doubts. This effect can be experienced in our day to day lives and in every field. The best way to explain this is:""Expectations about an experience, good or bad, makes the real experience more or less similar to our expectations""That is why the famous motivational speaker Les Brown always says: ""Everybody wants to be successful, who in their right mind would say that they don't want to be successful, in their own rights of-course. But do you expect to be successful? Do you fell that there's something brilliant waiting for you right around the corner?"" This question has stumped many people because we are always so fixated on what could go wrong that we never even contemplate what could go right. Even if we figure out all the possibilities regarding what could go wrong, at the end of an experience we would be relieved not happy/excited. We have a tendency to dismiss everything which goes right as luck and whatever that goes wrong as our own mistake. The whole field of risk analysis is based upon this expectation. Is it wrong to expect? No, its natural, involuntary most of the times. But what I'm saying is that expectations have a very prominent ability to influence the overall experience and the worst part is that we will never even notice the difference and defend our part of the story for eternity""If the available knowledge, explored/yet to be explored, is the basis of balance, then on one side of the weighing machine there would be knowledge of human mind and on the other side would be everything else""- Anonymous  "
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.0) Interesting, not really comparable to Freakonomics, but if you're so inclined, it's much betterI most enjoy that Ariely bases this book on actual experiments in behavioral economics, not just analyzing data. Each chapter is pretty formulaic: some anecdote or ""imagine you are..."" kind of scenario, then the ""So we decided to try an experiment"". Then he tells of the experiment, using a specific subject by name, telling about the counterintuitive thing that he or she did. Then he explains that that was the general trend in the study. Then he tries to extrapolate to real life. And it kinda works. He's got a decent dry humor too, which helps.He uncovers some predictable irrational behaviors that we seem to exhibit:* we frequently use relative comparisons between options whenever possible, even when it drives us to completely miscalculate value of the options (""anchoring works"" and ""make sure your wingman is similar looking/personality but not quite as good"")* demand is often not rationally driven by supply (more ""anchoring works"")* the high cost of FREE! (you will do silly things to get stuff ""free"", often costing you more than an alternative)* we either operate under social norms or market norms, and be sure to create the environment you want! (""don't offer to pay your mother-in-law for a great thanksgiving dinner"")* when you're aroused/excited/angry/emotional, you make bad decisions (duh)* people procrastinate (you should set up firm deadlines (with consequences) to make sure you get things done (well))* we overvalue what we have (and undervalue what we failed to obtain)...sounds like the flipside of sour grapes* people tend to keep options open, even when it's detrimental to them (""just dump the bum and find a better boyfriend"")* your expectations of an experience will greatly determine the pleasure you derive from it (context matters... a lot)* placebos work, and even better if you think they're expensive* even honest people will cheat a little, and even more when the cheating is one step removed from cash-money* make your decisions ahead of time when you can - e.g. allocate % of your future raises to retirement plan before it happens - order your food before hearing what others will order (you're more likely to order something that someone else isn't ordering and tend to enjoy it less than if you stick to your guns)* if you need to do something that is good in the long term but unpleasant in the short term, try to make a positive association with that (e.g. for his interferon treatments, he watched a movie as soon as he injected, so the immediate association with the injection was one of pleasure, not vomiting)"

The author from the beginning dispels most of the standard economic theories concerning human behaviour, which assumes humans to be rational creatures(homo economicus), and narrows down his focus on how irrationality plays an intrinsic role in shaping human behavior.In the course of this book, the author narrates his findings from the various experiments that have been conducted by him and other social scientists at different universities(mostly the MIT and Duke), and the inferences drawn from these experiments are very succinctly explained and quite easily understandable.The topics covered in this book, are mostly related to the various problems and decisions we encounter in day to day life, like choosing the best magazine subscription plan, getting stuffs at a discount, selecting items for an order at a restaurant with friends and so on. The author provides numerous examples to demonstrate how irrationality pervades our entire behaviour and the arguments he puts forth are very convincing. I personally found this book to be very informative and at the same time quite an amusing experience, it's in my opinion probably one of the best books written on the emerging subject of behavioral economics and should be an essential reading especially for marketeers,salespeople and most importantly consumers.

Despite being a slim volume (a mere 7h of audio book), it felt like I was hearing the same thing over and over, very similar experiments showing something that could be summed up way faster in a short article - unless you want to make money on it by turning it into a brightly colored book for people who apparently know very little about people. Perhaps it's better with tables, lists and stuff, not as an audio book.One thing that bothered me was also the degree of difference achieved in different groups in experiments. Often, they seemed quite small. What kind of variation can occur naturally when you deal with people as research subjects? How significant were these results? What are they compared to? It all just felt so... random!"

No, I take that back: it is quite reassuring to know that while the principles of logic have their place, people are influenced by other factors.Professor Ariely explains some of the factors that influence our decisionmaking: from the influence of emotions to the sometimes agonising choice between options; the pitfalls of procrastination and the lure of free offers. And why is it that we are often perfectly willing to do something for nothing, but not if payment is involved? From the discussion of the creation of a market for black pearls through discussion of types of dishonesty, Professor Ariely provides insights into human behaviour, in many cases backed by experiments that have tested his hypotheses. This book is primarily focussed on behavioural economics, but I would argue that it would be of interest to a far wider group of readers. We are all decisionmakers and our decisions impact on others. I believe that many of us with a specific interest in public policy or management, in marketing, or in human behaviour more generally would find value in reading this book. While many of the concepts are profound, the subject matter is presented in a readable and entertaining way."

If you've already read a few popular behavioral physiology books then this book might just help you understand ideas you've already heard about but also introduce a ton of new stuff. The big idea of the book is that irrationality is systematic and predictable, which means that whether we like it or not we are all biased. And we can't help it. The only thing we can do is recognize these biases and potentially work out a solution. Overall, this book is very fascinating read because it's such an accurate representation of situations we see every day. I would go as far as to say that it's impossible not to be able to relate to the research studies from the. I'd highly recommend reading this book as you'll be able to understand behavior of the people around much better."

His process includes:- Give a question.- Do many experiments to see how different factors influence it.- Bring out the psychology behind it.Questions mentioned in this books can be referred to many circumstances and even though as a reader I may still make very irrational decisions, I get to understand more to minimize them.Very useful book."

62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1512303-dennis,4,"I have often pondered questions such as why one would drive all the way across town just to save a few cents per gallon buying cheaper gas, even when the analysis does not seem to consider factors such as time, or even the amount of gas expended on the supposed cost-savings pursuit. Or what about those who the day after Thanksgiving stand in line for hours at the department store in the darkness of early morning only to receive a modest discount. Probably these are the same folks who spend more time than a typical lunch hour in a quest to buy a one dollar sandwich. Then there are those in the majority culture who willingly pay multiple thousands to obtain diamonds as a status symbol even though their value is artificially inflated by cartels.Predictably Irrational answers these kinds of questions and more in a thoroughly enjoyable offering from researchers in the growing field of behavioral economics (think Malcom Gladwell or Freakonomics) who ask deceptively mundane questions that produce fascinating results shedding light on us all. I personally prefer this author to Gladwell. He is funny, relatable, and eminently clear in his writing without ever seeming smug or piously jaunty from his lofty perch atop the heights of academia (except maybe when he drops the names of research partners from other prestigious institutions ... Princeton, Yale, Columbia ...).The science shows that even the brightest among us act irrationally every day. Most of the research explained in this book was conducted at MIT, Harvard, and Duke, where students are supposedly more intelligent and perhaps more ethical than the average layperson. Yet time after time carefully designed studies show that even the creme de la creme are susceptible to human frailties on very basic principles.A few of the many important concepts explored include the difference between social norms and market norms. In other words, we interact differently depending on whether it is among friends and family versus business contacts. And things can get dicey when the two are conflated, believe me. It's why I am happy to help out a friend or neighbor, even with legal advice from time to time, but when they try to convert it into an economic transaction things become awkward. Likewise, studies show that lawyers are more frequently enticed to work pro bono than when a modest sum is offered per hour. It's the difference between serving for a good cause (social) and being devalued through an insultingly low hourly rate (market).Another intriguing, if somewhat intuitive, phenomenon is that emotions can profoundly alter our decision making. Most of us know it's not a great idea to drive when we are angry, for example. Similarly, sexual arousal significantly distorts inhibitions and causes us to make much different choices than we would make in a cooler state. Interestingly, I read a rather bizarre review of this book that ""discovered"" misogyny on this point because the author designed a test to determine what changes would occur in the things heterosexual college men say about what sexual activities they would do, and with whom they would do them, when answering the questions before and after they are aroused. Basically, the reviewer was angry to learn that in this condition college men are more likely to engage with women (but also men) they wouldn't ordinarily find attractive. That, my friends, cuts out ""half the population,"" according to one very angry reviewer. Because sexism, or something. No need to mention that men and women alike are ""sex objects"" to, well, anyone desiring to have sex. Why the fact a man desires some women (a biological fact, and one the angry reviewer never bothered to posit the other way around) also means that he hates women, and does not appreciate women's minds or other characteristics, is beyond me. But that doesn't stop people from writing silly stuff they learned in women's studies courses, or scores of like minded people from agreeing with them in lockstep, many of whom have never even read the book. Predictably irrational? Ironically, this book also has chapters that touch on confirmation bias, which seems to be what angry reviewers will find in this and probably many other places -- sexism where none exists.Anyhow.I enjoyed the chapters about the siren song of FREE! (a marketer's dream for boosting sales -- such as Amazon's free shipping even though often it is a worse deal over all), also about overvaluing what we have, the power of the placebo effect, and how reminding people about the Ten Commandments just before a test can dramatically reduce cheating. To me that signifies yet another way in which religion enhances the public sphere and should be nurtured rather than spurned.In short, the book is packed with fun and interesting tidbits and illustrates ways that we can sharpen our own habits to behave more rationally. In the end, humans are highly complex with many factors at play at any given moment and so it's unrealistic to expect that we will behave perfectly rationally. Still, studies show that irrationality can be predicted. Fascinating and enjoyable read."
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"Perhaps the most important concept I learned here is Ariely's distinction between market (which I think actually means monetary) and social exchanges. Each of these exchanges comes with its own norms. When we exchange money for goods and services, we are in the realm of market norms. If we exchange gifts or rituals (a gesture of thanks like bringing wine to a dinner), we are in the realm of social norms. Ariely warns against moments that confuse the distinction and uses dating (does the man pay for the meal?) as a classic example that can spark tension between people, but we can also imagine a person who brings wine when invited to a dinner and announces how much it cost.To test the effect, Ariely offers students chocolates in exchange for lab work--a gift of thanks. But when he offered them a ""fifty cent"" chocolate bar or a ""five dollar"" chocolate bar, their willingness to diligently do the work was affected. Regardless, social norms, though powerful, don't return if market norms take over the behavior. Ariely mentions a school that tried to fine parents who picked up their kids late. The market exchange caused parents to ignore whether or not it is rude to be late; they instead considered only whether they were willing to pay for lateness. Tardiness increased, and did so again when the school tried to revert to monetary rewards because the social norm for punctuality did not return. Parents just now felt they were getting tardiness for free!Although we should be wary of this mixing of market and social norms, it seems like we do it all the time and without any thought that the change might backfire. One can see this especially in responses to feminist criticisms of social roles. Many contributions that women have traditionally made to their community have been coded as ""social exchanges,"" even though the economy in many respects disadvantages women because their labor is not done as part of the market (for pay) but is rather done for the good of the society or the family. Because money is power in our culture, women in these systems have less social power than male income earners. So should we, for example, pay women to have children--or compensate them for doing this thing that removes them from the market and access to power? For some, this may seem abhorrent or ridiculous. And yet we seem far more comfortable when employers and businesses frame their interactions using the language of social norms by referring to their employees or customers as family.What more can we do with this dynamic? I wonder if we could expect people who dislike cultural shifts in general to further dislike any intrusion into the social norms by the market. How consistently would this happen, I wonder? Would this dynamic align more closely to people who suffer no cost by the social exchanges? In those moments that the economy tightens, perhaps we should expect greater tension in the culture because there will be a strain on the barrier between social norms and market norms in addition to the financial recession. How much of innovation consists of finding social exchanges and monetizing them--or adding an advertisement to the bottom of them?In what other ways are people predictably irrational? For one, people are unduly influenced by things that are free. For another, if a company offers three options, one is a decoy. There's option 1, option 1-, and option 2. 1- exists to make consumers choose option 1 over option 2. I wonder if private business has a messaging advantage over any public project as the former can take advantage of our irrationality by providing a false context, while the latter probably mostly suffers from it. Third, ownership causes people to overvalue their possessions--as well as their ideas should they come to feel they ""own"" them. There is also some interesting content on honesty and dishonesty towards the end. Ariely also includes some evidence that arousal shifts decision making, but does a younger man's willingness to sleep with, for example, a 40 year old woman, when aroused reveal that he is more rational in a non-aroused state?Should you read this book, or just a couple chapters? In accordance with the economics tradition of writing for a popular audience, Ariely has agreed to massive margins, generous spacing, and a bulky font. I suspect the idea here is to market a pamphlet as a book to make people feel better about themselves because they'll feel more accomplished for having read a book and they'll pay for a book in a way that they might not for an article or a series of articles. I find these books and their now far too familiar impish humour grating. I also find his representation of Shakespeare a bit... under-interrogated. Still, I have to admit that economists seem to do well by these books. They appear to sell well, and I further speculate that the influence of economists comes in part from their willingness to dress up their findings in this dime a dozen style, a sort of amplifying advertising that pays off for the entire field. Should all scholars or all disciplines devote more energy to this sort of book?3.5."

Perhaps evidence that he’s the better writer while Thaler is the more influential economist. So, assuming you are looking for a good book to read, and are not an economist or a member of the Nobel committee, and only have time for one on behavioral economics, I’d recommend this one. If you are an economist, you’ve almost certainly already read both of them, or, rather, as much as you felt like reading before you set them aside and ignored sunk costs. If you are a member of the Nobel committee, then you are delusional, because you aren’t.I mostly read about economics these days. It’s made me hyper-aware of my behavior and its occasional irrationality. For example, I bought this book for 50¢ and would not have paid much more for it, but thanks to the endowment effect, I wouldn’t sell it for less than several times that amount. On the other hand, I’d be happy to give it away to a friend I thought might enjoy it, illustrating the irrational but undeniable distinction between social norms and market norms. Warning: this is the way I think now, all the time, about everything. Don’t read about behavioral economics if you just want to live your life without second-guessing every choice you ever make. It’s sort of like that scene in The Matrix where Morpheus offers Neo the blue pill, representing blissful ignorance. On the other hand:You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. "

This insightful 384-page book is composed of the following fifteen chapters: 1. The Truth about Relativity Why Everything Is Relative--Even When It Shouldn't Be, 2. The Fallacy of Supply and Demand Why the Price of Pearls--and Everything Else--Is Up in the Air, 3. The Cost of Zero Cost Why We Often Pay Too Much When We Pay Nothing, 4. The Cost of Social Norms Why We Are Happy to Do Things, but Not When We Are Paid to Do Them, 5. The Power of a Free Cookie, 6. The Influence of Arousal Why Hot Is Much Hotter Than We Realize, 7. The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control Why We Can't Make Ourselves Do What We Want to Do, 8. The High Price of Ownership Why We Overvalue What We Have, 9. Keeping Doors Open Why Options Distract Us from Our Main Objective, 10. The Effect of Expectations Why the Mind Gets What It Expects, 11. The Power of Price Why a 50-Cent Aspirin Can Do What a Penny Aspirin Can't, 12. The Cycle of Distrust, 13.The Context of Our Character, Part I Why We Are Dishonest, and What We Can Do about It, 14. The Context of Our Character, Part II Why Dealing with Cash Makes Us More Honest, and 15. Beer and Free Lunches What Is Behavioral Economics, and Where Are the Free Lunches?Positives:1. A well written, well-researched book.2. Engaging prose. A page turner.3. The fascinating topic of irrational behavior with a focus on behavior economics.4. Great rhythm to the book. The author does a wonderful job of keeping the readers' interest by jumping from one interesting topic to another. He also ties every chapter together by summarizing the findings.5. The book is full of interesting behavioral studies, and anecdotes.6. The notion that we like to make decisions based on comparisons. ""This is the problem of relativity--we look at our decisions in a relative way and compare them locally to the available alternative.""7. Great concepts are introduced like arbitrary coherence, ""The basic idea of arbitrary coherence is this: although initial prices are ""arbitrary,"" once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this makes them ""coherent"").""8. The irrationality of FREE! ""WHEN CHOOSING BETWEEN two products, then, we often overreact to the free one.""9. The cost of social norms is a fantastic chapter, ""The conclusion: no one is offended by a small gift, because even small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from market norms.""10. When social norms clash with market rules, ""The basic lesson, then, is that when we offer people a financial payment in a situation that is governed by social norms, the added payment could actually reduce their motivation to engage and help out.""11. The influence of arousal, how emotions grab hold of us. ""In every case, our bright young participants answered the questions very differently when they were aroused from when they were in a ""cold"" state.""12. Interesting discussion on gratification and self-control. ""In order to overcome many types of human fallibility, I believe it's useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and positive reinforcements with the not-so-pleasant steps we have to take toward our long-term objectives.""13. Understanding why we overvalue, ""OUR PROPENSITY TO overvalue what we own is a basic human bias, and it reflects a more general tendency to fall in love with, and be overly optimistic about, anything that has to do with ourselves.""14. The power of expectations. ""As it turns out, positive expectations allow us to enjoy things more and improve our perception of the world around us.""15. The power of placebos. ""The truth is that placebos run on the power of suggestion. They are effective because people believe in them.""16. Why we distrust, the tragedy of the commons. ""But because human beings tend to focus on short-term benefits and our own immediate needs, such tragedies of the commons occur frequently.""17. The issue of honesty. ""...individuals are honest only to the extent that suits them (including their desire to please others).""18. Making it perfectly clear that economics makes a lot more sense if it were based on how people actually behave, instead of how they should behave.19. A formal bibliography.Negatives:1. Always take behavioral science with a grain of salt until we get a much stronger grasp on neuroscience. Very little in this book is grounded in neuroscience.2. The vast majority of the experiments were conducted with college kids, not what I consider representative of the whole population.3. Some missed opportunities. Very few big business applications.4. Surprisingly, I thought the chapter on sexuality was one of the most predictable.5. Always dangerous to mix politics and economics.In summary, what a fun way to learn about behavioral economics. Professor Ariely is an engaging writer and has provided the reader a wide spectrum of experiments and anecdotes that are sure to amuse the public. That being said, behavioral science must be taken with a grain of salt. Neuroscience is in its infancy and will surely provide a foundation from which behavioral science can take off from. Interesting, amusing and a page turner of a book. I highly recommend it with reservations noted.Further suggestions: ""Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior"" by Leonard Mlodinow, ""Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain"" by David Eagleman, ""Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard"" by Chip and Dan Heath, ""Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us"" by Daniel H.

I heard about behavioral economics and the study of human biases first in 2006 or 2007, and it blew my mind. Suddenly I found the science that explains human behaviour in terms I could understand. People are not, in fact, idiotic apes behaving randomly; we are reasonably smart apes who have very consistent biases in our thinking processes. I can honestly say that blogs such as Overcoming Bias and books such as Thinking, Fast and Slow changed the way I looked at the world. It's been over 10 years now, and I've read several books and countless blog posts on human (ir)rationality. I've even taught the subject to school age kids. That's why I'm having trouble reviewing this book: I have heard it all before. Back in 2007 this would've been a five-star book for me, but now I don't know. It doesn't help that some of the studies Ariely is referencing haven't replicated in later attempts. Indeed, the whole field of ""priming studies"" is nowadays called into question, if not dismissed outright, since so many of the seminal studies didn't replicate. ""Stereotype threat"" isn't looking so hot, either. That means that many of the conclusions Ariely draws in this book are not, in fact, reliable.But all in all, this is not a bad book. I can't really wholeheartedly recommend it, due to the prominence of those later-falsified studies I mentioned above. But if you remember that whenever Ariely talks about ""priming"" you should just skip ahead and forget about those parts, this is an okay book and a good introduction to the subject."

Israeli author and behavioral economist who in his book challenging the standard theories of economic that are around since Adam Smith and earlier. I got deeply fascinated by ingenious experiments they pulled off in an unusually broad range of topics to give a good fight to old mighty (and holy) belief of rationality.nevertheless he shows that how frequently and in many ways, weirdly we act and make decision while we think the acts and decisions are completely sane and logical. "
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17519772-jordan-shirkman,4,"The basic assumption in economic theory is that people act rationally. Unfortunately, we aren't always rational beings. Ariely provides plenty of examples of just how irrational we are, and how we can prepare for and predict our irrationality.There are a number of good practical implications for individuals and organizations.Unfortunately, there is a chapter studying arousal that is morally reprehensible. I suggest skipping that chapter entirely."
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,3,I know I'm an irrational person but I didn't realize all humans are. The author used controlled experiments to come up with this conclusion. The most surprising to me was one experiment showing humans are slightly dishonest if they know they won't be caught. At least MIT and Harvard students can be a bit dishonest (and students from other prestigious colleges) because those are the people he used in most of his studies. An amusing twist is when he had the subjects read the ten commandments before the experiment. Humans never fail to amaze me.

Ariely explodes the myth of rational thinking and how we see ourselves, backing it up with far-reaching and extensive studies. This 'revised and expanded' version also has a final chapter on the cause of the credit crunch and how behavioural science and a better look at rational economics can better safeguard, or even prevent its reoccurrence. The sort of stuff we should be teaching in our schools. 9 out of 12."

73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51673993-sarede-switzer,4,The book starts out really strong and engaging but gets weaker towards the middle. Was still overall enjoyable and moderately thought provoking. Was reminiscent of Cialdini's Influence which I think is significantly richer.
74,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91752985-jason,5,"Having now read this book among other behavioral economics books such as Freakonomics, Super Freakonomics, and Everybody Lies, I enjoyed this the most. It's actually one of my favorite reads this year. Freakonomics and Everybody Lies can feel like a bag of interesting news headlines. The information presented in those books was fascinating, yet seemed far removed. This book was personal. The situations presented were choices we as humans are faced with every day. If you are looking for an eye-opening experience to help you see the world and your own decisions more objectively, this is the book. Highly, highly recommend. "

78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393530-laura-haske,5,"Behavioral economics is the study of people and how they spend money and make decisions. This is not a spoiler: people are irrational. But we are predictable, which means we might be able to learn from our errors and make better choices. I loved the author’s voice. He was informative, personally interesting, and witty. I’d read more of this stuff."
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62188192-nadiya,5,A great book. Very well structured and concise. Very practical and interesting material. Highly recommended to anyone interested in understanding irrationally in human behavior and in figuring out how to counter it in daily life.
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20415579-marie,3,"Sometimes it's hard to read this book and even harder to read it anywhere else then on the public transportation.Some of the experiments and foundings are interesting but some are not that highly proven. For example the one of dishonesty where students were told to cheat on average but they didn't supply the average scores of the students in general and also the test was highly general consisting of all kinds of questions which doesn't prove if they actually everyone cheated or not. One study with better theme did Stephen D. Levitt with teachers and testing their dishonesty where the teachers helped with their testing in favor of benefiting the teachers and their teaching accomplishments.The ""wanking"" part of the book was.. just weird. Again, it's hardly making a point if it only takes young man and not one woman or people of different ages. What point did Ariely want to have? That young man are just really horny guys with no limits when it comes to climax? Whatever Ariely.....Overall I did enjoy the book but it had moments where it really repeated itself a lot even if pointed out made it harder to read this book."
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7628843-prasanth,3,"This book is part of my quest to read more on the topic of behavioral economics. There are some new takeaways here - such as market vs social norms (e.g., you won't offer to pay your friend for helping with your move to a new apartment), and how we like to keep our options open even if it comes at a cost (the opportunity cost of our indecisiveness).However majority of the book iterates on the basic aspects of behavioral economics such as endowment effect, loss aversion, placebo effects, etc. If I had read this book a few years ago, I would have enjoyed it better.

85,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,4,"I picked up Predictably Irrational on the strength of Trevor's review (http://apps.new.facebook.com/good_rea...), and so will go light on my usual stream of blather since I think other Goodreaders have more than said everything you need to know about this approachable summary of experiments in behavioral science. I'll limit myself to two more personal comments.First, I can't give this book the full five stars, because I think it's a bit lighter in the information department. (That said, I'm not saying that dense-packing of the book with page after page of experimental support would be an improvement.) Ariely builds his chapters around the theme that people are hardwired to make value judgements based as much on emotion (appeals to fear, excitement, perception of risk, convenience, scarcity, conformity or individuality) and willful ignorance or self-justification (will anyone notice if I take this one cookie?) as on reason, and as such, are easily and frequently manipulated or acting counter to their own (or our collective) conscious expectations. He illustrates this theme through various experimental examples, where the structure of each chapter becomes basically premise, description and results of experiment(s) to test premise, and potential extrapolation of experimental findings to other social contexts. Halfway through the book, this got (for me) a bit repetitive, as I found the descriptions of experimental methodology more longwinded than I needed (albeit written in a completely approachable style, no worries there, as I could easily imagine this being an immensely pleasurable audio book for commuters). As well, I felt his discussion of presumed experimental implications tended toward filler. So, while I could just as easily appreciated a leaner version of this book as bathroom reading -- Eight Experiments to Shock Your Friends! -- I recognize that doing so would surely deprive readers of the companionable, affable, and thoroughly delightful authorial voice.Second, because I am a bit twisted and perverse, I have to say that anyone who would subject 8 year old trick-or-treaters to an ingenious series of Monty Hall-style trades to test their risk tolerance (begging the question of what's worth more, a Kiss in the hand or a bar in the bucket?) is alright by me. Makes me snicker again just thinking about it. No question, that was my favorite moment of the book, and while I really hope those kids egg Ariely's house next year, understand that I say that in a fond, loving way."
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,3,"""If I were to distill one main lesson from the research described in this book, it is that we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend. We usually think of ourselves as sitting in the driver's seat, with ultimate control over the decisions we make and the direction our life takes; but, alas, this perception has more to do with our desires-with how we want to view ourselves-than with reality.""Awesome quote right? Yes, I agree. So why 3.5 stars? Yes, I know that I can not actually rate a book on here 3.5 stars. However, that is what I've decided to rate it nonetheless. Why? Because I will not allow the hidden administrative forces of Good Reads to force me to rate this only 3 stars. I liked this book, and the extra half star were for the great moments of brilliance scattered through out. It lost 1.5 stars for a few reasons. The Placebo Effect is old news, everyone and their grandmother knows by now what this is, so it was nothing new and proved to be one of those subjects that deserved a lot less experimentation and a lot less writing.The other reason was that at some points in the book it became overtly repetitive. It was like Ariely was amazed at having reached a conclusion and so decided to keep on repeating it over and over until I as a reader felt like I was being treated like a child.Other than those reasons which brought the book down from a perfect rating I really enjoyed the chapters on ""the effects of expectation"",""the influence of arousal"", and ""keeping doors open"". Even if some of those ideas have also been fully disclosed, (much like the Placebo effect) it was still interesting to read about the arousal experiment and the keeping doors open experiment. The main idea of the book could be summarized by the following paragraph quoted verbatim: ""Each of the chapters in this book describes a force (emotions, relativity, social norms, etc.) that influences our behavior. And while these influences exert a lot of power over our behavior, our natural tendency is to vastly underestimate or completely ignore this power. These influences have an effect on us not because we lack knowledge, lack practice, or are weak-minded. On the contrary, they repeatedly affect experts as well as novices in systematic and predictable ways. The resulting mistakes are simply how we go about our lives, how we ""do business."" They are a part of us."" Overall it was a good read (pun intended) and necessary to learn a little bit more about the interesting subject of behavioral economics. "
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18716604-murray,4,"An excellent treatise on the irrational aspects of human decision making as it pertains to supposedly rational economic theory. I think he’s has very good points and fun research that proves the point.Ariely is an Israeli working at MIT. His field is behavioral psychology and I am excited by the prospect of more and more psychology being thought of at the level of the evolutionary organization of our brains and thoughts.“When stripping away our preconceptions and our previous knowledge is not possible, perhaps we can at least acknowledge that we are all biased. If we acknowledge that we are trapped within our perspective, which partially blinds us to the truth, we may be able to accept the idea that conflicts generally require a neutral third party—who has not been tainted with our expectations—to set down the rules and regulations. Of course, accepting the word of a third party is not easy and not always possible; but when it is possible, it can yield substantial benefits. And for that reason alone, we must continue to try.”He discussed relativity of pricing, fallacy of supply and demand, the cost of zero cost, the cost of social norms (why we are happy to do things but not when we are paid to do them), The effects of sexual arousal (and by extension other highly charged emotional states) on rational thought, procrastination and self control, why we overvalue what we own, why options distract us from our objectives, the effect of expectations, the power of price, why we are dishonest, why dealing with cash makes us more honest.His experiments with students of course have a lot of selection bias built in. The numbers are small.I disagree with some of his sweeping conclusions that are permeated by his liberal bias. He extrapolates his small, isolated experiments in one small aspect of behavior in one small population to the population at large where many different factors would be simultaneously playing a role. He would grant the government powers to protect us without critically assessing what irrational forces are particular to government and why that might be deleterious to the greater society as irrational as it might be."
88,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828191-amy,3,"Predictably Irrational is written by MIT Behavior Economist Dan Ariely. The basis of his book is that while standard economic theory assumes that we all make rational decisions to maximize our personal utility in any number of situations, we don't always behave rationally and make the best decisions. Further, we not only act irrationally, but we behave irrationally in predictable patterns. In his work, Ariely collaborates with other researchers and designs social experiments to test the decisions that people will make and discover those patterns. The benefit of his work is that if we recognize the ways we behave irrationally, we have room for improvements that will increase our well-being. One of my favorite chapters was about the effect that options have on our behavior; how we are so reluctant to let any option disappear or door close that we fight to keep that option alive rather than throwing ourselves into the best, most rational option (i.e. a person continuing a romantic relationship that isn't going anywhere; buying the extra 100 GB storage for your computer ""just in case""; choosing between majors, or graduate programs, or jobs - it is often painful to see a door close). Another favorite chapter was about how powerful the placebo effect is, even in cases of surgery. There are procedures that have been done thousands of times that when later tested had similar results to a ""placebo"" surgery. I thought the social experiments Ariely wrote about were very interesting, but his writing style was lacking for me, at times a little boring. I also wished he had given a few examples in the book of when he thought standard economic theory is the best model, because I'm still a fan of classic economics and that beautiful supply and demand curve. I'm a little nerd-girl at heart."
89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,4,"I’ve always considered myself a frugal restaurant goer, always declining the most expensive entrée. Now Dan Ariely tells me I am behaving predictably – but not necessarily rationally. The less expensive meal I choose seems like a good deal because I have something to compare it to. Thus I can feel that I am making an economical choice because there is an expensive choice staring me in the face, and I turn it down. The expensive entrée is placed there as a decoy, and the clever restaurateur knows exactly what he/she is doing.Oh, well. So much for my rational mind.Ariely has made studies of human behavior, particularly as it relates to money decisions. His creative and ingenious research focuses on the myriad of decisions that we make, and the predispositions that influence those decisions.One astonishing experiment found subjects more honest if they had previously tried to recall the Ten Commandments. Another found that we feel better if we have taken an expensive pill rather than a cheap one (both placebos).It is tempting at times when reading this book to conclude that we are really not the masters of our fates, but the victims of all the things that subtly and silently influence us. Ariely argues that this is not the case. Rather, we should be aware of our biases and learn from them. We should become students of human nature and our own nature.Next time I might actually order the expensive meal if it looks like the one I really want!"
