The novel re-imagines the lives of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and German geographer Alexander von Humboldt —who was accompanied on his journeys by Aime Bonpland— and their many groundbreaking ways of taking the world's measure, as well as Humboldt's and Bonpland's travels in America and their meeting in 1828. One subplot fictionalizes the conflict between Gauss and his son Eugene; while Eugene wanted to become a linguist, his father decreed that he study law. تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی ام ماه جولای سال 2012 میلادیعنوان: اندازه‌ گیری دنیا ؛ نویسنده: دانیل کلمان؛ مترجم: ناتالی چوبینه؛ تهران، افق، 1390؛ در 367 ص؛ شابک: 9789643697587؛ چاپ سوم 1394؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان آلمانی - سده 21 ماندازه‌ گیری دنیا ؛ نام رمانی ست که توسط نویسنده ی آلمانی: «دانیل کلمان»، در سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شده است. این رمان نتیجه ی ملاقات سال 1828 میلادی، بین ریاضیدان آلمانی: «کارل فریدریش گاوس»؛ و: «الکساندر فون هومبولت»،است، که در سفرهای خویش همراه با: «آیم بن‌ پلان» در آمریکا را، شرح می‌دهد. یکی از داستان‌های فرعی کتاب، درگیری بین «گاوس»، و پسرش «اُیگن» است؛ «اُیگن» می‌خواهد زبان‌شناس شود، اما پدرش میخواهد، که او حقوق بخواند. ا. شربیانی"
1,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5," The Gene(ius) Pool In the early 19th century Germany ruled the intellectual world. Or more accurately, given that Germany didn’t yet exist, German was the globally dominant language of science, philosophy, and most other cultural pursuits.  Measuring the World  is a light-hearted docudrama of the intersecting life of two of the most important intellectual leaders of the period: The explorer and naturalist (and Prussian) Alexander von Humboldt, and the mathematical prodigy Carl Friedrich Gauss (an Hanoverian). Together they transformed human understanding of both things and symbols, as well as the connection between things and symbols. That is to say, they created a new language.The backgrounds of these two men show that genius is purely genetic. Humboldt was a member of a well-fed, well-educated, and well-connected elite. Gauss’s mother, on the other hand, was illiterate and his father was a labourer. Humboldt survived a young brother who tried to kill him, and being raised by the servants. Gauss survived the persecution of jealous teachers and a social awkwardness verging on the autistic. Both thrived because they were recognised and rewarded by monarchical rulers as contributing to German culture. One wonders what their fates might have been in the competitive academic milieu of a modern pragmatic democracy.Above all two traits/principles/character flaws unite these two men. First, for them everything is connected to everything else. Distinctions between areas of knowledge are not simply arbitrary, they are irrelevant. Both defy classification into a definite academic niche. They are quite simply interested in everything that is, a sort of openness which is astounding in its apparent lack of limits. If they had taken up painting, they would be considered today greater than Michelangelo (thus the power of visual advertising!)Second, both shared a passion for numbers. Numbers are what brought reality closer. They reduced the gap between what Kant (yes, another German) had called the thing-in-itself and our perception of it. Measurement was philosophy in action. Increasing precision in measurement meant progress, an improvement in understanding that was demonstrable. Numbers, as the ancient Greeks suggested, provided a sort of divine view of the world. Numbers were fixed in their relations to each other, unlike natural language which was fuzzy and required less than perfect translation out of the mother-tongue into barbaric dialects like English and French.What the two men did was to create a new cultural era. Measurement was a metaphor for hope. Kant’s aporias didn’t imply an intellectual dead end. And hadn’t he put religion aside into a parallel world that seemed increasingly unnecessary? Numbers could improve the world not just describe it. Numbers formed the new foundation for human salvation. They were almost magical in their power to reveal and explain how the world came to be, to simplify its apparent complexity, and to predict its further development. Numbers were the future. Numbers touched reality:“At the base of physics were rules, at the base of rules there were laws, at the base of laws there were numbers; if one looked at them intently, one could recognize relationships between them, repulsions or attractions.”  The patterns revealed by numbers allowed the telling of stories which had never been told before. Stories of intense heat in the Earth, of antiquities older than ever before dreamed of, stories of parallel lines that meet, of bizarre celestial phenomena. The language of numbers wasn’t just more reliable than any other language, it was bigger. It permitted discussion of things no other languages knew about. It pointed to things that were hidden in normal speech. It resolved paradoxes and suggested previously unthought possibilities. The world got used to being measured. The web of numbers imposed itself upon the world so thoroughly that it was taken as the world. This is what all languages do, and perhaps the language of numbers best of all. Human beings engage in this fantasy of language as reality in order to maintain hope or, more generally, to stay sane. Faith in measurement is even more intense than faith in God. As it turns out the object of the two faiths is exactly the same: language. Language is our fundamental technology and we worship it. Today, we have a new language - digital electronics - in which we have as deep a faith as Humboldt and Gauss had in theirs. Genius, it seems, even exceptional German genius is not immune to the temptation of idolatry."

That is a quite common answer if you ask a group of motivated preteen students what they want to do when they grow up. Hungry little caterpillars, they eat their way through a mixed diet of knowledge and skills over the course of their education before entering the strange teenage cocoon stage when they can't be bothered with anything but their own physical and social development.As a teacher, you look at all these potential explorers, and their diverse approaches to life, and to learning and interpretation of reality, and you think:""I have no doubt that they will explore the world, but what EXACTLY that will mean, nobody can tell until they are fully developed butterflies, with their own individual patterns and flight routes!""That is the core of the story Kehlmann tells, by using the examples of two famous adventurers of the Enlightenment. You can sit in your room and explore the abstract world of mathematics in your own isolated brain, like Gauss, or you can climb mountains, swim through rivers, march through swamps, and collect physical evidence of your journey, like Alexander von Humboldt. Either way, you will be exploring the world, according to your needs, your history, your education and your personality.Genius has many shapes, and expresses itself in various ways, is the optimistic message (a life-saving one for teachers who work with the post-caterpillar, pre-butterfly cocoon-stage). Geniuses are humans with specific talents and difficulties, and their own issues, is the realistic conclusion, and all it takes to cross the line between ordinary talent and genius may be a stubborn curious desire to move on towards an ever changing horizon.Geniuses achieve great things with ordinary bodies and minds, and extraordinary belief in the possibilities of the world.Geniuses can be grumpy and worried and arrogant and absent-minded and just plain funny, they come in all colours and shapes. What do they have in common? They use their wings!"
3,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,2,"""It was both odd and injust, said Gauss, a real example of the pitiful arbitrariness of existence, that you were born into a particular time and held prisoner there whether you wanted it or not. It gave you an indecent advantage over the past and made you a clown vis-a-vis the future.""I'm not sure what to make of this one: I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. It certainly was not what I expected. I do admire Kehlmann for trying a different angle on a historical novel about two eminent characters in their own time. The novel style and focus on what basically is a sequence of vignettes work well to bring out the character in Kehlmann's two subjects - Humboldt and Gauss.  However, this is at the expense of any historical facts (other than that the two people existed): There is one (or maybe two) references to dates in this book, and I felt this was only to give the reader a timeframe to anchor the story in. Other than this, there are very few facts in this story that could be referenced back to anything. Yet, this is not due to a lack of research on the part of the author. To draw a picture of both characters in as much detail as he does would have required a lot of research. The book just does not bring this across which makes this more a novel that featured two characters with the names of actual people and some enterprises these people may have set out to, but little else makes this book feel like a historical novel. And this is where my problem is again: If I want to read about actual people, I want facts, I want references, I want to be able to go away and read more about something they did. I do not want speculation about what they have thought or felt, or whether their brother tried to kill them when they were little. Unless I can go away and find other supporting material about any of this, I am simply not interested. The upside to the book was that there was no love triangle, which so often spoils historical fiction books.2.5*"
4,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,2,"This novel was very popular in Germany when it came out (titled Die Vermessung der Welt) and it along with another book he wrote in 2003, Ich und Kaminski [Me and Kaminski], won the Kleist Prize for literature in 2006. This is the second book I have tried by this author, and I gave Fame a ‘solid’ 3 stars. This one was a tough one to get through…I was waiting for it to finally get over which is a not a good sign. 2 stars. ☹How does one credibly review a book when one reads this on Wikipedia: His novel Die Vermessung der Welt (translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway as Measuring the World, 2006) is the best-selling book in the German language since Patrick Süskind's Perfume was released in 1985. According to The New York Times, it was the world's second best-selling novel in 2006.What the hell is wrong with me?!In this book the lives of two famous German people are depicted: Dr. Carl Friedrich Gauss, the world famous mathematician/physicist. We are told their life stories in the third person. Later on in the novel they meet. As far as I can tell this is not a work of historical fiction, although from briefly looking at Wikipedia certainly their professional actions are duly noted and described in the book. It is Kehlmann’s depiction of their personal lives and those they interacted with I did not like. Two examples then I will gracefully leave:•	Jim: Humboldt is exploring in Venezuela and came across a mission (I guess a missionary living with the natives)… “The inhabitants of the mission were turning spits over a fire with the head of a child, three tiny hands, and four little feet with what were clearly toes. Not human, explained the missionary. They stopped whatever they could. Just little monkeys from the forest. Bonpland refused to eat any. Humboldt hesitated, but took a hand and bit into it. It didn’t taste bad but he didn’t feel well. Would people be offended of he didn’t eat it all? The missionary shook his head, mouth full. Nobody would notice!”Later that evening ensues a conversation between Kehlmann and his fellow explorers debating over whether what they were eating was human flesh. The way Kehlmann presented the dialog was in a comical sort of way. I was just grossed out. One, if cannibalism had taken place, I know nothing about why cannibalism occurs…how the practice originated, why it occurs….but I don’t find it to be a laughing matter. Cannibalism occurs/occurred — don’t portray it as funny and don’t put it on the shoulders of the “natives”.•	One of Humboldt’s fellow explorers has sex with a chieftain’s daughter. Humboldt and his fellow explorers just came upon this group of people that same day. Was the sex consensual? Am I supposed to find this also cute or humorous…I know these kind of events occurred and how explorers sometimes treated those they came upon…but the way Kehlmann presented it just disturbed me. His style of writing was not dark in this novel…it was supposed to be witty…so coming across this and the way he presented it just bothered me. ...And this was less than halfway through the book. The putative cannibalism was less than halfway through the book. So these two events really disturbed me and I still had over half of a book to go through. And one of the protagonists, Gauss, was a prick…after his wife died in childbirth within that hour he was literally thinking about finding another wife (“He pushed back the chair and tried to accustom himself to the thought that he would have to marry again. He had children. He had no idea how one brought them up. He couldn’t run a household. Servants cost money""). So there. I have vented my spleen. 😕Note: this is the fifth book I have read that has been translated by Carol Brown Janeway.

5,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"Fascinating read. A scientific historical novel (first published in 2005) originally written in German by young author, Daniel Kehlmann (born 1975). It is said to be the worldwide bestselling German novel since Patrick Suskind's Perfume in 1985. This is a story of a two scientists during the time of Napoleon reign in Europe. The first scientist is Alexander von Humboldt who is a botanist, geologist and an explorer. He has an elder brother Wilhelm von Humboldt who lives a ""normal"" life, i.e., study, work, marry, raise a family and die while Humboldt pursues his dream of proving the scientific theory called ""Neptunism"" or the belief that the core of the earth is solid rock. That mountain ranges are created by the chemical precipitations left as the primordial ocean shrinks. That the fire in volcanoes doesn't come from deep in the earth but is fed by burning coalfields. This theory was championed by both churches and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.(Remember that this was during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who was a German writer and polymath, 1749-1832. By the way, as this is a historical scientific novel, both the Humboldt brothers were also real German famous personalities)The second scientist is Carl Friedrich Gauss who is a mathematician and scientist. He is also the author of the book Disquisitiones which deals with the number consolidating theory that shaped several mathematical theories known today. He is a boy genius in mathematics. I particularly enjoyed the classroom scene when his ""terror"" butt-spanking teacher asks him to add all the numbers from 1 to 100 thinking that the young Gauss will manually write and add all the numbers from 1 to 100. What he does, to the astonishment of the said teacher, is that he starts with a hundred and one. A hundred plus one equals a hundred and one. Ninety-nine plus two equals a hundred and one. Always a hundred and one. Ninety-eight plus three equals a hundred and one. You could do that fifty times. So, fifty times a hundred and one."" Answer: five thousand and fifty!Unlike Humboldt, Gauss has a family, he got married twice and has 6 children. One of his children, his son Eugen, is one of the main characters in the novel. He feels unloved because Gauss is disappointed that they do not share the same interest. Gauss is a genius while his son Eugen has an average intellect.The novel is divided into several chapters with the life and times of Gauss and Humboldt alternating until the fifth to the last chapter when they meet. The novel shows what scientist in the 18th century go through (almost spending their whole life and even their family and social life) to pursue their careers and academic passions. The book is full of anecdotes and scientific theories and explanations that Kehlmann was able to tell in a light and even funny way. Something that only gifted storytellers can successfully pull off.My favorite quote comes at the last part of the story when Humboldt was in his ""sunset"" year as a scientist and his sister-in-law, the wife of his elder brother died. This is part of his speech prior to visiting the deathbed:

What, ladies and gentlemen, is death? Fundamentally it is not extinction and those seconds when life ends, but the slow decline that precedes it, that creeping debility that extends over years: the time in which a person is still there and yet not there, in which he can still imagine that although his prime is long since past, it lingers yet. So circumspectly, ladies and gentlemen, has nature organized our death!""

In the same chapter, Gauss receives a letter from his elder brother (remember that they are both old and gray already). This is after the funeral and the elder Humboldt is thanking him for his visit and support during the death of his wife. Part of the letter is this:

Whether we see each other again or not, now once more, it is just we two, as it always was fundamentally. We were inculcated early with the lesson that life requires an audience. We both believed that the whole world was ours. Little by little the circles became smaller, and we were forced to realize that the actual goal of all our efforts was not the cosmos but merely each other. Because of you I wanted to become a minister, because of me you had to conquer the highest mountain and the deepest caverns, for you I founded the greatest university, for me you discovered South America, and only fools who fail to understand the significance of a single life in double form would describe this as a rivalry...""

For me, the message of the novel is how we will be ""measured"" in terms of how we lived our lives at the end of our stay in this world. More than financial wealth and highest position we reach in our careers, it is how we loved and how we were loved back by those who we shared our lives with. Also posted in here. "
6,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13636365-stef-smulders,2,"Don't like this book. The characters of the historical figures of Gauss and Von Humboldt are flat, like in a graphic novel. As a result it is even difficult to keep the two apart. I do not see the sense of using real people in a novel if you do not try to develop their psychology, not try to understand their motives, doubts, struggles. In this novel it remains superficial. There is some humor, yes, but again, what is this book meant to be? A satire? Of what? As a historical novel I cannot take it seriously. "
7,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177596-oceana2602,4,"Daniel Kehlmann's Measuring the World was one of my birthday presents last year, and I waited almost a year to finally read it. Even though it had been on my wishlist, when it suddenly sat there on my shelf, the idea of reading about pre-industrialization Germany, about Humboldt and Gauß, two boring old scientist, seemed rather dreadful.I should have known better. Measuring the World is not a science book. It's not about two boring old men either, though it is about two old scientist. And the way Kehlmann describes them, you feel as if you had known them forever from the first moment. Humboldt's enthusiam, his absolute NEED to measure things, to experience, not to miss anything no matter at what cost, is as palpable as Gauß's displeasure at traveling, a cranky old geezer is, I think, what one would call him (or ""ein griesgrämiger alter Kauz""). Kehlmann makes both of them exceptionally human, with all the flaws, and at the same time manages to describe their genius without forcing it on the reader. Their stories become cleverly interwoven and mixed up with Kehlmann's excellent dialogues. The book captivated me and made me laugh out loud more than once. Historical or scientific value or accuracy may have been sacrificed for entertainment in many cases, but that seems only fitting in the time we live. ;-)P.S.: I read the original German version, so I don't know if the English translation is any good. I'd be interested in opinions."
8,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Fictional account of the lives and meeting (towards the end of their lives at a scientific congress that Humboldt holds) of two great German scientists – the naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt (whose brother was also a great politician and linguist) – who explored and opened up and the mathematician and physicist Gauss. The translated English is written in a simple and slightly stilting style but is easy to read and the range of ideas and concepts covered is what makes the book.As the title suggests both are obsessed with measurement – but whereas Humboldt travels far and wide and seems to believe that the world is better understood by discovery, measurement, reporting and charting; Gauss in contrast resents the time he has to spend as a surveyor (although approaching the task with drive and mathematical rigour) and is more interested in the insights it gives him into mathematical reality – e.g. the concept that parallel lines meet in infinity and that space and time are curved. The book is also set against the background of brewing political rebellion in Germany in the mid-1800’s with both scientists not just revolutionary thinkers in their scientific thinking but both also magnificently unaware of what is going on around them – from mundane concerns to wider geo-political events such as the Napoleonic wars. Humboldt’s travels to the Americas allows Kehlmann to integrate high science and German culture with magic realism – with Humboldt still persistently seeking to explain, assess and categorise even in bizarre and surreal surroundings."
9,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47571190-beata,5,I just wanted to take a short break from two extremely serious and depressing books I'm reading at the moment and thought that plunging into the worlds of two geniuses would be perfect. Re-reading this novel is as fascinating as it was while reading it for the first time.
10,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"“Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them.” This is a delightful historical picaresque about two late-eighteenth-century German scientists: Alexander von Humboldt, who valiantly explored South America and the Russian steppes, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a misanthropic mathematician whose true genius wasn’t fully realized in his surveying and astronomical work. Both difficult in their own way, the men represent different models for how to do science: an adventurous one who goes on journeys of discovery, and one who stays at home looking at what’s right under his nose. (Gauss envisions a scientist as “A man alone at his desk. A sheet of paper in front of him, at most a telescope as well, and a clear sky outside the window.”) I especially loved Gauss’s hot-air balloon ride and Humboldt’s attempt to summit a mountain. The lack of speech marks somehow adds to the dry wit."
11,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1746401-friederike-knabe,5,"I read this back in 2007 in English, now in German for a book club. Here is my 2007 review.It is not uncommon to find fictional accounts of the lives of famous historical figures, nor of encounters between them. Kehlmann's book is unusual in its choice of personalities and in the way in which he creates an entertaining description of the two. In the late eighteenth century, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt had both embarked on the same quest: finding a new way of measuring the world. The two heroes couldn't be more different in character and approach. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist whereas von Humboldt saw him as a world traveler, collecting the evidence in the field and taking measurements wherever he went. Basing himself on the historical records of their lives and work, Kehlmann has created a tongue-in-cheek intimate portrait of these two scientific giants of their time.Gauss was a child prodigy from poor lower class background. He became known as the ""Prince of Mathematicians"" for his mathematical genius and who wrote his major scientific work at the age of 21. His name has been attached to many scientific discoveries including magnetism and astronomy. Not much is known of his private life, though, except for the bare facts of family and jobs that he had to support himself. He treated many of his scientific deductions as too easy and commonsensical to write about, only to be annoyed when somebody else published something related. Today we would say he was a curmudgeon kind of character. Count von Humboldt, on the other hand, came from a well-off aristocratic family and was spoiled for options what to do with his life. He and brother Wilhelm, a diplomat and linguist, have been a household name then and now, at least in German speaking countries. Alexander's work as a naturalist and explorer were well publicized during his lifetime. He was the first to explore the geological and botanical diversity of remote regions of Central and Latin America and wrote detailed scientific reports about his findings. He is seen as one of the fathers of biogeography. Later on, his travel bug took him all the way across Russia and almost to China. Late in life, the geniuses meet at the 1828 science congress in Berlin. However, the encounter didn't quite live up to the expectations built over many years of knowing of each other's work in the same area of science.Kehlmann brings his subjects close to the reader by focusing on a series of episodes from each of their lives, alternating between the two. Written in a lively style, he endears us to their personalities, bringing out their strengths and foibles. He introduces us to their scientific findings in a light-hearted easy-going way that capture the essence without overburdening the reader. Rather than creating long section of dialogue, he lets his protagonists express themselves in indirect dialogue. Allusions to contemporary events and issues are sprinkled throughout the narrative and add an often funny commentary. Measuring the World is a great read and highly recommended."
12,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4596610-nicola,4,"I'm a Bill Bryson fan so I'm used to reading about the quirky characters that history throws up; men (and sometimes women) of vast and fascinating eccentricity, whose contribution to science and progress is given that extra soupçon of interest by their delightful battiness. In Measuring the World we have exhibit A: Alexander von Humbold - a Prussian aristocrat with rampant OCD, determined to measure everything around him in an effort to quantify and so, understand, the world.and exhibit B: Carl Friedrich Gauss - A poor German whose gift for mathematics is the wonder of his age. And whose inability to deal with the abject stupidity of absolutely everyone around him is the despair of everyone around him...These two colossal kooks are brought to life by Daniel Kehlmann, although with what dedication to absolute veracity I do not know, always a concern of mine when dealing with Historical Fiction which purports to lean heavily on the 'Historical' rather than the 'Fiction' part. I'm rather in the dark with these two - at least with the Phillipa Gregory's of the literary world I know where they stand with regard to historical accuracy (down the road, mired in a muddy ditch - She gets the names right but for much more than that I'm not prepared to give her credit) because I'm so familiar with history of that period. For these two...? More reading is required :-)If you don't give a hoot about historical accuracy and just want a great read with an author who makes science interesting, informative and also truthful! (Jules Verne eat your heart out) then this book is great. Well, it's great anyway but it's probably greater to not have nagging thoughts of 'Just how truthful are these accounts?' Follow these two extraordinary men as they go from bright eyed youths to cantankerous old codgers, exploring and expanding the frontiers of science as they go. Von Humboldt's travels all over the globe and down the Orinoco I found especially fascinating. It was an age of exploration and he dedicated his life and a great deal of his fortune to it. Gauss by contrast hated travel; his greatest explorations are within his mind. Unlike Von Humboldt, he didn't have a personal fortune, and I hate to think how much more he would have accomplished if he hadn't been stymied by the need to work in a rather boring career during what could have been his most productive years for scientific discovery.I wasn't really expecting to find a book like this on the 1001 list, but I guess that is what makes it so great. This sort of story will expand more than your knowledge of authors and books, this will expand your knowledge of the entire world. "
13,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1,4,"So 200 years ago the world was a pretty big place. Not any bigger than it is now but it had the feel of a larger ball of rock as many humans were still scrambling about ""discovering"" places. Note - most of these places had already been discovered by the people who lived in them. They just didn't shout about it in quite the same way. It is also interesting to note that the people doing the scrambling about were, for the most part, European. Is this because all Europe-ers are massive nosy bastards? Or maybe everyone else is happy where they are, mainly because fate/god/evolution saw to it that they got a warmer and more exotic spot on the big ball of rock. Another hypothesis might be that some parts of Europe were actually quite late off the mark with regards to general international nosiness. Empires from China, Persia, Greece, Italy and the Middle East had already got a lot of wandering out of their system prior to the time many Europeans were just stretching their legs and wondering exactly what was over the next hill.The ""nosey Europe-ers"" in question in this book are Gauss and Humboldt, both of whom were real gentlemen who did lots of simultaneous wandering and pondering. At this point, I suppose it would be good to present people with some hard facts that I may have learned (or Googled) about Gauss or Humboldt but I don't have any so I am unable to pass comment on how much artistic license Kehlmann took with the main characters. Essentially they are both stupendously clever but Gauss is cleverer than Humboldt what with being your more bog-standard genius and all. Humboldt is pretty smart, incredibly observant and probably an early example of someone with undiagnosed low latent inhibition (if you watched Prison Break then you'll know what I mean). Humboldts determination to be a genius actually almost puts him on level pegging with Gauss who is a bit lazier and less inclined to travel outside of Prussia.Is there a moral to this slightly comedic tale of exploration by two men, both with issues? Not really. Doesn't make it a bad read though, just means you'll walk away thinking ""ok well that was quite nice"" rather than ""wow I am a better and more well rounded sentient entity for reading that""."

The preconditions were good: A novel about two scientists, one being Alexander von Humboldt, the other one no less a figure than Carl Gauss himself.I am the one to blame for how bad this went. I chose to read this as an audio book. As it turns out, this was a huge mistake. I realize now that I’m easily distracted when I’m listening to audio books. This is not a big problem when my audio book of choice is a light and fluffy YA book, but it just doesn’t work out when it’s a heavy Historical Fiction novel with quite some amount of inner monologue and jumping between perspectives. I found myself often confused as to who I was following at the moment and (especially with Humboldt) how he got from A to B.I loved Gauss as a character, he was my absolute favorite. He was just hilarious and lovely and incredibly interesting. He is the reason I might try this book again in its physical form.However, I also found myself wondering many times if things actually happened how they were depicted.

And you do not need any particular scientific knowledge or interest to find the book appealing. On the other hand, the story itself is not the point, it never is (at least not to me). If I had to isolate the element from which the entire beauty of this novel unfolds, it would be the style.The narrative is dynamic, fast-paced, the sentences short and often laconic. From that point of view it is charming how the oh-so-German megalomania represented in Humboldt’s and Gauß’ work is diminished by the concise presentation of it. Instead of detailed portrayals you get sketches, but they are more the sufficient to create a very human and three-dimensional image of the protagonists.The two stories are told alternately, and even though Humboldt and Gauß do not meet until the end (chronologically), there are many parallels and connections between the two of them, which creates a movie-like quality.The main feature is the exceptionally clever humour. I laughed aloud sitting alone in a room thanks to the irony and self-irony (e.g. coming from a modern-day narrator depicting the issues of 19th-century everyday life to a modern reader, yet never leaving the frame of the story). The author makes full use of every imaginable stereotype about scientists, Germans or German scientists: there is the genius reduced to a clerk, the underestimated apprentice, the life-long rivalry between ambitious brothers, aristocratic children trained for greatness from an early age, the child prodigy from a lower-class family, the ideal of creating a complete and indisputable system based on one grand idea and most of all the socially incompetent genius with a larger-than-life perception of the own persona (Hello, Sheldon) etc. A special treat are the slight but sufficient hints of intrigue and vanity in high political and intellectual circles.Intelligence, humour, sarcasm, weirdness ‒ what more could one ask for? And yes, at times it does feel like a basic version of The Big Bang Theory."

In this case, a historical novel about a German explorer named Humboldt and a German mathematician and astronomer named Gauss. Some chapters you get the explorer (more entertaining, if episodic due to the movement in the Americas) and some chapters. you get the math (eh). Brief scenes of interest, but not so gripping after all, and little investment in the characters who are anything but warm, fuzzy types. Rather the stereotypical Germans instead.

17,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34401683-bob-brinkmeyer,4,"Daniel Kehlmnn’s thoroughly engaging novel Measuring the World follows the exploits of two of history’s towering figures of mathematics and natural science in their pursuits to measure the world: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. Gauss and Humboldt stand starkly opposite in their methods and outlooks. Gauss focuses on numbers and equations (and then later on theoretical physics) while Humboldt delves wholeheartedly into the natural world. The contrast reveals itself most starkly in a conversation between the two. Science, Gauss tells Humboldt, “is a man alone at his desk. A sheet of paper in front of him, at most a telescope as well, and a clear sky outside the window.” For Humboldt, a man who has embarked on repeated quests all over the world to collect samples and measure natural phenomena, confinement in a room would be like being condemned to prison. What about journeys, he asks Gauss. “Whatever was hiding way out there in holes or volcanoes or mines was accidental, unimportant,” Gauss responds. “That wasn’t how the world would become clearer.” No doubt Humboldt is aghast. The two men, put simply, represent parallel lines of thought, parallel ways of measuring the world. Can the two ever meet in their intellectual endeavors?Parallel lines can’t by definition meet—or can they? Indeed, this is precisely a problem that Gauss ponders, coming to the stunning conclusion, in his reconfiguration of Euclidean principles (into what’s now known as non-Euclidean geometry), that they indeed can. And one can see Kehlmann drawing from Gauss’s conclusion to structure his work. The novel opens with Gauss and Humboldt meeting in Berlin in 1828, and then moves back in time providing, in alternating chapters, their histories and escapades leading up until that meeting. Once the novel is back in Berlin in 1828, the two parallel men/lines having converged (literally if not scientifically), the novel then follows their further exploits, but this time, though they diverge in terms of space and time, they somehow are still engaged psychically and intellectually, seemingly conversing across great distances and now working together on the mysteries of magnetic fields. Perhaps we should call it non-Euclidean narrative.If narrative structure is important, so too is tone and perspective, which are decidedly comic. Kehlmann takes to heart an observation he gives to Gauss: “It was both odd and unjust, said Gauss, a real example of the pitiful arbitrariness of existence, that you were born into a particular time and held prisoner there whether you wanted it or not. It gave you an indecent advantage over the past and made you a clown vis-à-vis the future.” Not that Gauss and Humboldt come off as clowns—their brilliance is everywhere evident—but they often do appear clownish, primarily because they are so absorbed in their intellectual endeavors that they remain oblivious to the demands of the everyday world and of everyday social graces. When immersed in his great work, Disquitiones Arithemeticae, Gauss remains unmindful of the Napoleonic War engulfing the continent (Napoleon? Who? What?), while Humboldt is so focused during his far-flung journeys on measuring and collecting that he loses sight not only of the beauty of the world but more importantly of the precarious, death-defying situations into which he often puts himself and his assistant. In my favorite line from the novel, Humboldt’s assistant asks in frustration: “Did one always have to be so German?”The answer, of course, is that to achieve what he did, Humboldt, as well as Gauss, indeed had to be so German—that is, entirely fixated on their work. Comic in their foibles, brilliant in their quests for knowledge, Gauss and Humboldt remain to this day towering figures in the ways we understand and measure the world."
18,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13703358-ms-smartarse,2,"Translated into English as Measuring the World.Carl Friedrich Gauß and Alexander von Humboldt were two brilliant scientists who each set out to measure the world. Humboldt decided to travel to remote places, measuring anything and everything on the way, using various devices. Gauss on the other hand, managed to do his measuring remotely, by means of complex mathematical equations.First, I don't much like biographies. With exttemely few exceptions, they all end up boring me one way or another. Granted, our two heroes led some rather interesting lives, if only due to how much they stood out in a crowd. That said, I still found myself tuning the book out quite often. I even tried reading it aloud, but then I started concentrating on my pronunciation rather than the story.Second, I read the book in German, a language in which I'm not competent enough to fully appreciate subtle nuances.Third, I couldn't see the humor, even when it hit me over the head. I really wanted at least a little reprieve from the difficulty in language comprehension, but the most I felt was mild disgust. I mean, I can definitely point out scenes that should have logically felt funny, but I could barely muster up a faint giggle.Score: 2/5 starsI hated the two main characters with a passion. Not because they lacked any modesty about their smarts, rather due to their need to patronize all those who fell short of their mile-high standards. So 99% of the world.Bottom line: if I hadn't been constantly tuning the story out, I might've given it 3 stars..."
19,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7359792-kathrin,4,"Picking up the book I knew more about Alexander von Humboldt than Carl Friedrich Gauss. My lifelong love for museums confronted me a lot with Humboldt's expeditions while the only knowledge I had of Gauss goes back to my school days. What intrigued me the most was a sole question - would the author be able to hold my interest. Reading (or listening to) a biographical novel can be frustrating when the author ventures too far into details. It's easy to be overwhelmed with too much information. In my opinion, Kehlmann did a decent job. His story follows both explorers on their quests to measure and understand their world a little better. At some point in the story, I liked Humboldt story arc more, while I enjoyed other times to read about Gauss. Despite learning a lot, I've got to admit that the story has its lengths. However, I liked the engaging way of the author's writing as well as the setting. You can probably tell the story of two explorers with the example of two other people but with setting the story in the time of Enlightenment made it all the more compelling. I love to think about the fact that people had to conquer many obstacles to see and explore the world while nowadays all you have to do is book a ticket. Makes me appreciate the times I live in a little more. All in all, 'Measuring the World' is a great read that I can recommend to fans of historical fiction. I would have also enjoyed the read when I was way younger - maybe I would have even liked school a little more. "
20,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27950748-jonathan-pool,4," Synopsis The book opens in 1828 as Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss, two luminaries of the early c.19th., both attend the German Scientists' Convention in Berlin. An imagined meeting between the two, forms the basis of Daniel Kehlmann’s fictionalisation, and he cleverly juxtaposes two men revered by their contemporaries as they sought to explore and explain the world via, respectively, observation and exploration (Humbold) and mathematical, and astronomical analysis (Gauss). The two pioneers have separate, alternating, chapters dedicated to their exploits and revelations, though the two come together in direct dialogue as the book progresses.In 1803, aged thirty three Humboldt made an expedition to South America, with (largely overlooked) partner Aime Bonpland, and as well as describing numerous adventures, mapped the natural canal connecting the Orinoco and the Amazon rivers. This trip lasted five years, and is the subject of the first half of the book as Humboldt discovered previously uncharted animals, flora, indigenous peoples, and clarified Europe’s territorial claims in New Spain (whose maps and boundaries were vague). The journey started in Spain, progressed via Tenerife, moved on to Cuba, then Venezuela, and into the Amazon region, returning to the ""City of Palaces"" (now known as Mexico City). The journey home was via Havana, Cuba, then to USA’s temporary capital, Philadelphia. Humboldt’s “measuring” skills, and his personal dedication and sometime disregard for his own safety, come through clearly in Kehlmann’s narrative. This is a story of remote Jesuit missions, cannibalism, grave robbing, and the breaking of world records (Chimborazo in the Andes where Humboldt climbed to a height of 18,690 feet altitude). Humboldt is not averse to self experimentation using Curare, a paralysing toxin.In the latter stages of the book, Humboldt’s visit in older age, to Russia, are described. The fame achieved by Humboldt preceded him, and the hangers on, and the crowds of onlookers turned these trips into a circus. What is truly apparent is that Humboldt, or his research methods, was by now outdated, and there’s a palpable sense that it’s a different world; one that has moved on (this the 1830’s).The parallel account of Gauss’s exploits is less geographically diverse, and is the stuff of fewer anecdotes and stories of great derring-do. Kehlmann concentrates more closely on Gauss’s personality, and particularly the trials and tribulations in his family life. Gauss wrote his  Disquisitiones Arithmeticae  (“Arithmetical Investigations"") in 1798, aged 21, and was recognised as a child genius. For those of us (myself included) who are not natural mathematicians, the Gauss sections of the book are harder to follow, and less colourful. Testing Euclid’s theories, and principles of Triangulation are a bit dry for the non-technical reader.It was said of Gauss “ He has been sent into the world with an intellect that rendered almost everything human impossible”  (82)Intriguingly both men had day jobs to pay the bills and in the need to secure funds to support their passions. Gauss, head of The State Boundaries Commission in Hannover, and Humboldt as the assessor in the Department of Mines in Prussia.Kehlmann’s conflation of the lives of the two men is well done, and when Gauss is aloft in a hot air balloon (a very early journey with Pilâtre), the outline of the globe is commented upon:  “all parallel lines meet”  (54) It could be an epithet to describe the lives and influence of Humboldt and Gauss as their differing interests and approaches to knowledge eventually converge in Kehlmann’s fiction. Highlights As somebody whose school history took in very little c.19th century German history, the sweep of events described was new, and fascinating. Kehlmann does enliven academic narrative with small detail and some humour. In particular• Reality of an era without ‘tooth doctors’.• Mosquitos everywhere, all the time.• The brutality (ignorance? naiveté?) of early explorers. In particular the study of the hunting behaviour of two crocodiles in Havana (141)•	The system of divided collections was invented, because of the hazardous nature of transport homewards.  Lowlights • Eugen Gauss (Carl Friedrich’s son) opens and closes the book. I am not convinced that removing Eugen from the story entirely would diminish the book.• Cavalier attitude towards women and girls. There is little of no sense that women were of any use in the period. Gauss’s response to his mothers death seems a bit unlikely.• Writing style when Humboldt and Gauss are in imagined dialogue together is confusing. This may just be the translation? Historical & LiteraryThis is a primarily a historical novel. I learned a lot about a period of time of which I was largely ignorant. Numerous emerging philosophies and inventions, in a pre-industrial world, occur throughout the book. The licence taken by Kehlmann enlivens the events rather than disrespects them.• Daguerre. The father of photography• Neptunism/ Volcanos/ Mountains (Humboldt had climbed more than anyone else on earth (178)• Humboldt’s brother, (the contrast between two talented, and different men, in an imagined fiction, would conceivably have made a more natural fit from a literary writers perspective) “ a pair of brothers in whom the whole panoply of human aspirations so manifested itself” (13)Elder brother worked with Schiller and Goethe, and he was a leading educationalist.When they left each other’s company, always asked if they would see each other again: “In this world or the next. In the flesh or in the light” (32) (226)A backdrop to the activities of the two central protagonists is the political and national changes ongoing in Western Europe.Napoleon knew of both men and jokingly, Gauss claims that Napoleon didn’t bombard Gottingen because of his presence there (160). Of Humboldt  “ Napoleon had always hated him”  (184)•  “German Gymnastics” (4) Latent nationalism apparent in causes that Gauss’s son is drawn to,• Goethe to Humboldt before his expedition-  “don’t forget where you come from  (28)Politics and PatronageHumboldt, a German, preferred Paris. He lived there for years as a representative of Prussia's Friedrich Wilhelm III.Gauss, of more humble origins- “ he knew that there would soon be no more dukes”(49). Nonetheless he was financially dependent on the Duke of Brunswick, in Hannover.The fascinating contrast between hereditary position and natural born talent and the emergence of genius from both sources is well examined in Black Oxford’s review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Humboldt in history• Humboldt inspired scientists and writers including Jules Verne and Charles Darwin (‘the reason why he boarded the Beagle’), Goethe, (who declared that spending a few days with Humboldt was like “having lived several years”.) Henry David Thoreau (poet anda naturalist). Walden  would have been a very different book without Humboldt. Walt Whitman wrote  Leaves of Grass  with a copy of one of Humboldt’s books on his desk• Humboldt’s name still widely evident, from the Humboldt Current running along the west coast of South America to the Humboldt penguin.QuestionsAccuracy of anecdotes? It’s the writers prerogative to embellish the truth when writing fiction. There are some obvious flights of fancy (behind bedroom doors, for example), and its fun to guess what is absolute truth and what is make believe.• Alexander Von Humbolt’s brother is explicitly never referred to by his name (Wilhelm ). Why is this?• Humboldt meets numerous travellers in the wild beyond (Jesuit missions were active, and governments despatched explorers in the national interest). One man (Brombacher) appears in the middle of the jungle. Its almost Monty Pythonesque. Did such a person exist?Author background & ReviewsAccording to The New York Times, Measuring the World was the world's second best-selling novel in 2006. It has sold more than 2.5 million copies in Germany alone. All his subsequent novels have reached the number one spot on Germany's Spiegel bestseller list His most recent novel  Tyll  has sold more than 600,000 copies in German alone, is due to be published in the UK in February 2020, and is being adapted into a TV series.RecommendAlways, with historical fiction, the question I ask myself is whether the use of a fictional wrap to tell of mostly factual events, adds something to a straightforward academic text, and/or a Wikipedia look up. I’m not sure that Daniel Kehlmann pulls this off from a purely literary perspective. The final third of the book, the Russian expedition for Humboldt, is messy. That said, there’s much to like and it’s a book I would recommend to many of my friends "
21,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Measuring the World reimagines the life of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and geographer Alexander von Humboldt. The book follows a fictionalised account of their journey, along with Aimé Bonpland as they measure the world. Their methods where ground-breaking and this novel entangles their lives to explore their effects on science today.This is not a book of science, this is historical fiction that explores the lives of two German scientists. While the subject matter may sound dull and fact heavy, Daniel Kehlmann handles the topic with skill. It is an impressive feat to make a subject that sounds boring come across exciting and interesting. Kehlmann’s writing skills turns the subject of science into a novel of elegance and beauty.The two plots revolving around Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt worked well together and I found myself fully immersed in the whole experience. Having said that this is a book of science and German history so I feel hesitant in going into more details because I worry I will get the information wrong. That does make for short review but all I can really say is; read it.Published in German in 2005 under the title Die Vermessung der Welt, Measuring the World turned into a huge literary sensation for the country. This book knocked bestsellers like Harry Potter and Dan Brown off the list. The only other German book that has achieved that (that I know of) was Perfume by Patrick Süskind.This was a wonderful book and I learned a little about German and Prussian history. Carl Friedrich Gauss has sometimes been referred to as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and Alexander von Humboldt as the second Columbus. Two great people of history I knew nothing about and I think the opportunity to learn something new while reading beautiful prose made for a wonderful experience.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2014/..."
22,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,1,"A huge success in Germany. For the life of me I can't figure out why. Which were more boring - the parts about Gauss, or the parts about Humboldt? Trick question - they were equally soporific. What in hell was the point of this book? if I hadn't been confined to an aeroplane, I'd never have finished it. 5 Yawns on the snoozometer."
23,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11995655-daren,4,"I don't read a lot of fiction, but this is fictionalised - and appears to contain a lot of fact related to the travel and the science (and mathematics) of the two central characters - Alexander von Humboldt & Carl Friedrich Gauss. Both German, and contemporary, it is not clear to me if they ever met or were colleagues / friends, as they are in this book.Both fascinating men, but very different in their approach to their fields. Humboldt embodies inductive science - based on observation and experience - he is the explorer - the climber, the measurer, the scientist taking samples - plants, animals, rocks. Gauss is pure deductive science an academic, at his desk performing calculations, producing formulae, viewing the stars in his telescope. Similarly both geniuses, but very much presented here as quite human - flaws well captured in the flow of the novel. The larger crossover with Humboldt and Gauss is surveying - measuring the world. They both develop technique and carry out a significant amount of surveying and cartography.The third character in the novel is Aimé Bonpland, who travels with Humboldt, and provides a lot of the wit in Humboldt's chapters.The other constant character is Gauss' son Eugen. Despite being the son of a genius, Eugen is of average intellect. Eugen is a disappointment to Gauss, and shares none of the interests of his father.This was an enjoyable novel - funny in many parts, well paced, and interesting. The first half was much stronger, and from the midpoint onwards I found myself considering how it would be resolved, or in fact what the storyline here was to resolve. I suspect the storyline is somewhat light, and we are looking at a comparison between the two characters, and their approach to their work, and their lives, rather than pure plot.In a few other reviews I read, those who read it in its original German and in English have said the humour and tone didn't always translate successfully. I found it pretty amusing, so I was pretty surprised by that.Difficult to rate, as I haven't the intimate knowledge to know how much liberty the author took with the fictionalisation. I enjoyed it enough to be between three and four stars. Rounded up."
24,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3087989-sovotchka,2,"German books that are hyped enough to get translated seem to have something in common. That something being that I don't enjoy them very much.While I do believe that a meeting between Gauß and Humboldt could lead to an interesting book, and while I do know scientists that are so far removed from life that they're socially awkward, I don't think that focussing a book on the awkwardness of said scientists is a great idea.Gauß, although annoying and arrogant, seems to have a grasp on what a normal life is; even going so far as marrying, having kids, and calling upon his own idol. Humboldt seems to lack all that, being entirely too sure of himself and almost in love with his own intellect.There is a mention of their achievements; Gauß is shown as having no idea how he ever managed to write the Disquisitiones a mere two hours after finishing, and the most eccentric, awkward moments of Humboldt's travels are described.If I tell you that neither of the characters is ever likeable, that would be an understatement. In fact, upon their meeting both are so pretentious that the reader wonders how they ever managed to ensure their status as scientists despite their work. The interesting clash of ideas falls magnificently short, as was to be expected after a few hundred pages of pure pessimism. I honestly have no idea why this book was so hyped; maybe people like to read their own idea of what might have happened into it. Not recommended. At all. "
25,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7504717-austin,2,"In this novel, we follow the Adventurers/Intellectuals Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel at times, yet at other times i literally fell asleep due to boredom. If Daniel Kehlmann would have removed some of the formulas or numbers that did not apply to grasping the concept of the novel, I would have given it a rating of 4, or possibly even a 5 out of 5. This novel did an excellent job of demonstrating the struggles, both physical and emotional that those select few who have dared to improve the fields of science and mathematics have had to face over the ages. The adventures that take place, such as traveling through a jungle, climbing a mountain, etc. were extremely intriguing. However, these interesting parts were diminished by useless information. I enjoyed seeing things from the geniuses point of view, and beginning to feel how hard it must be to be a social outcast most of your life, yet not deterring from the path you have in mind. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not mind powering through dry parts, because the overall message of this book is a good one."

Humboldt with a hands-on approach, as he climbs volcanos, sails rivers and fights himself through jungles. Gauss, on the other hand, is quite the opposite, hates to travel, stays at home, and works solely with his mind. Apart from the famous Gauss curve, he managed to prove that space is curved.Finally, the two of them meet in Berlin.Daniel Kehlmann has written a historical novel. Despite of the fact it being purely fictional, Kehlman really understands what gets science interesting. Personally, I don’t give a rat’s ass if the story is true or not. The narration is beautiful.

But how much is based on diaries, letters etc. and how much is made up? My intuition is, a lot is made up.The brilliant ""The Invention of Nature” by Andrea Wulf managed to present the characters of Humboldt, Darwin and others more vividly while keeping to the limits of a documented historical account. Andrea Wulf also did a great job of explaining the historical significance of their work. Measuring the World does none of this. As fiction it’s mediocre, as historical reference it’s unusable."

29,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649884-nadine,5,"After falling in love with Kehlmann's Tyll, I had to see if he uses the same sly voice in his other books, or if it was specific to Tyll, where the main character was so cleverly slippery himself. Kehlmann does use a version of this voice and gives us teasingly affectionate, funny, and sometimes poignant portraits of Humboldt and Gauss - their genius and their MANY absurdities. The narrative voice sounded to me like a tongue-in-cheek historian who happily sacrifices accuracy for amusement, while still sticking to the historical trail. I will definitely have to bump up The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on my TBR to see just how far afield Kehlmann has gone to make Humboldt so entertaining. And also to check on how Bonpland, Humboldt's assistant, really fared on their travels - hopefully better than in Kehlmann's version. The rest of this review is mostly quotations, since the writing is SO good.Kehlmann's Humboldt is the intrepid, world traveler who takes empirical research to extremes that baffle those around him - he has himself tied to the bow of a ship to measure the waves, drops into a volcano on a rope, and asphyxiates himself in caves, to name just a few. Here's an example of one of Humboldts early experiments at home on electrical currents that also shows Kehmann's brand of humor and the writing devices he uses to achieve it:He took off his shirt, lay down on the bed, and instructed a servant to attach two cupping glasses to his back. The servant obeyed, and Humboldt's skin produced two large blisters. And now please cut the blisters open! The servant hesitated. Humboldt had to raise his voice, the servant took up the scalpel. It was so sharp that the cut caused almost no pain. Blood dripped onto the floor. Humboldt ordered a piece of zinc to be laid on one of the wounds.The servant asked if he could stop for a moment, he wasn't feeling well.Humboldt told him not to be so stupid. As a piece of silver touched the second wound, a painful spasm shot through his back muscles and up into his head. With a shaking hand he made a note: Musculus cucullaris, ongoing prickling sensation in dorsal vertebrae. No doubt about it, this was electricity! Repeat with the silver! He counted four shocks, regularly spaced, then the objects around him lost their color.When he regained consciousness, the servant was sitting white-faced on the floor, his hands bloody.Onward, said Humboldt, and with a strange shiver of apprehension he realized that something in him was finding pleasure in this. Now for the frogs!Oh no, said the servant.Humboldt asked if he was intending to look for a new job.The servant laid four dead, meticulously cleaned frogs on Humboldt's bloodied back. But this was quite enough, he said, after all they were both good Christians.Humboldt ignored him and ordered silver again. The shocks began immediately. With each one, as he saw in the mirror, the frogs jumped as if alive. He bit down into the pillow, the cloth was wet from his tears. The servant giggled hysterically. Gauss is temperamentally the opposite of Humboldt. Whereas Humboldt took a can-do attitude to ridiculous heights, Gauss lived in a permanent funk over the idiocy of everyone whose brain didn't work as fast as his - which was literally everyone. He was equally as socially obtuse as Humboldt, but had a family to inflict it upon.His students were the stupidest people he had ever met. He spoke so slowly that he had forgotten the beginning of his sentences before he'd reached the end. It didn't do any good. He left everything difficult out, and stuck to the absolute basics. They didn't understand. He wanted to cry. He wondered if halfwits had a special idiom that one could learn like a foreign language. He gesticulated with both hands, pointed to his lips, and shaped sounds exaggeratedly, as if he were dealing with the deaf... the dean took Gauss aside after the faculty meeting and begged him not to be so strict. When Gauss got home close to tears, he found only uninvited strangers: a doctor, a midwife, and his parents-in-law.He'd missed everything, said his mother-in-law. Head in the clouds again!He didn't even have a decent telescope, he said, upset. What had happened?It was a boy.What did she mean, a boy? Only when he saw her eyes did he understand. And he knew at once that she would never forgive him."
30,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."

They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
32,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
33,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
38,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
39,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
41,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

42,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
43,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
44,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
45,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
46,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."

With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed!

60,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."

They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
62,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
63,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
68,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
69,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "
70,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56145680-ari-levine,3,"3.5 stars, rounded down. An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
71,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

72,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
73,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
74,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
75,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
76,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."

With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed!

Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"
85,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54550030-cliff-esler,3,"It held my interest, and Daniel Kehlmann is certainly a good writer, but in some ways it seemed like a kind of absurdist story of two obsessive and half-crazed geniuses who neglected others while seeking to immortalize themselves and their reputations. In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
86,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."

It is not...it is a rough history significantly embellished with fictionalized narrative. I do not enjoy this genre. I can tolerate Erik Larson, but this book does not measure to that standard.

90,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."

They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
92,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
93,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
98,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
99,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
101,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

102,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
103,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
104,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."

In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
106,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."

With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed!

They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought. What more could you want? Sex, violence, and dragons, you say? Read a different book..."

113,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4687834-eadie,4,"I found this book to be rather charming. It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."
114,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"Although I love stories about great scientists, this is a disappointment to say the least. The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"
115,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54550030-cliff-esler,3,"It held my interest, and Daniel Kehlmann is certainly a good writer, but in some ways it seemed like a kind of absurdist story of two obsessive and half-crazed geniuses who neglected others while seeking to immortalize themselves and their reputations. In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
116,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."

It is not...it is a rough history significantly embellished with fictionalized narrative. I do not enjoy this genre. I can tolerate Erik Larson, but this book does not measure to that standard.

120,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."
121,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"Measuring the World is a historical novel tracking 2 characters, Alexander von Humboldt who travels the world to discover it, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a mathematician who stays put but travels vaster distances of cosmic discovery to find that space is curved. They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
122,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
123,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
128,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
129,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
131,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

132,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
133,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
134,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
135,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
136,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."

With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

138,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1204244-karen,2,"This was a must-read for a physicist spending the year in Göttingen on a Humboldt Fellowship: the lives of Gauss and Humboldt intertwined. What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."
139,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19603487-pep-bonet,4,"Very interesting. I discovered Kehlmann recently through a review in a Swiss journal and read Les Friedland. I was disappointed. It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."
140,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/478700-kylie-sparks,3,"This was an enjoyable and mildly amusing read for me. I'm pretty sure that if I was German, or read this book in German, I would have found it even funnier. Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists. It gave me an appreciation for how we know so many of the things we know about the world--what a crazy process of discovery it was."

It was also a big deal in Germany.The story is about the explorer Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss, beginning and ending in alternating chapters, with their interaction somewhere in the middle. They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought. What more could you want? Sex, violence, and dragons, you say? Read a different book..."

It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."

The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"

In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
146,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."

150,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."
151,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"Measuring the World is a historical novel tracking 2 characters, Alexander von Humboldt who travels the world to discover it, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a mathematician who stays put but travels vaster distances of cosmic discovery to find that space is curved. They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
152,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
153,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
158,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
159,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
161,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

162,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
163,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
164,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
165,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
166,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."
167,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617964-ak,3,"A perfectly fine historical novel that I probably would have been more receptive to if I hadn't read Andrea Wulf's excellent (non-fiction) book about Alexander Humboldt, The Invention of Nature, earlier this year. With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."

It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."

I'm pretty sure that if I was German, or read this book in German, I would have found it even funnier. Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists. It gave me an appreciation for how we know so many of the things we know about the world--what a crazy process of discovery it was."

They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought.

It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."

The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"

In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
176,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."

180,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."
181,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"Measuring the World is a historical novel tracking 2 characters, Alexander von Humboldt who travels the world to discover it, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a mathematician who stays put but travels vaster distances of cosmic discovery to find that space is curved. They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
182,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
183,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
188,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
189,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
191,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

192,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
193,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."

This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
195,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
196,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."

With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."

It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."

Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists.

They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought.

It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book.

206,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot.

210,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."
211,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"Measuring the World is a historical novel tracking 2 characters, Alexander von Humboldt who travels the world to discover it, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a mathematician who stays put but travels vaster distances of cosmic discovery to find that space is curved. They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
212,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
213,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does.

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
218,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."

This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
221,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
223,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
224,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
225,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
226,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."
227,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617964-ak,3,"A perfectly fine historical novel that I probably would have been more receptive to if I hadn't read Andrea Wulf's excellent (non-fiction) book about Alexander Humboldt, The Invention of Nature, earlier this year. With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character. "
228,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1204244-karen,2,"This was a must-read for a physicist spending the year in Göttingen on a Humboldt Fellowship: the lives of Gauss and Humboldt intertwined. What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."
229,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19603487-pep-bonet,4,"Very interesting. I discovered Kehlmann recently through a review in a Swiss journal and read Les Friedland. I was disappointed. It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."
230,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/478700-kylie-sparks,3,"This was an enjoyable and mildly amusing read for me. I'm pretty sure that if I was German, or read this book in German, I would have found it even funnier. Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists. It gave me an appreciation for how we know so many of the things we know about the world--what a crazy process of discovery it was."
231,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287856-david,4,"I like books that have short chapters and don't wallow in endless description. This is one. It was also a big deal in Germany.The story is about the explorer Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss, beginning and ending in alternating chapters, with their interaction somewhere in the middle. They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought. What more could you want? Sex, violence, and dragons, you say? Read a different book..."
232,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843716-andrea,5,"this book was a fine and immensely fascinating and satisfying read!i read it in one setting last nite, even stayed up late to finish it! it's that kind of book! you learn a lot about living 200 years ago, when there were no dentists, only sailboats and berlin a small town with mostly huts and dirty streets! and at the same time you are entertained! this book was a mega-bestseller in germany, he has a new book coming out called ""fame"", which deals with the protection of privacy in parts! i have never read him, have you?"
233,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4687834-eadie,4,"I found this book to be rather charming. It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."
234,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"Although I love stories about great scientists, this is a disappointment to say the least. The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"
235,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54550030-cliff-esler,3,"It held my interest, and Daniel Kehlmann is certainly a good writer, but in some ways it seemed like a kind of absurdist story of two obsessive and half-crazed geniuses who neglected others while seeking to immortalize themselves and their reputations. In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
236,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."
237,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39720114-jamie-z,2,"Full disclosure - this book was listed under non-fiction via my local digital library. It is not...it is a rough history significantly embellished with fictionalized narrative. I do not enjoy this genre. I can tolerate Erik Larson, but this book does not measure to that standard. It was rather disjointed and I would not recommend it."
238,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1031754-jen,3,"Interesting scientific fiction, but the characters are not very likeable and overall it's a bit of a downer. It's about two 19th C. German scientists, and one of them goes on a trip to the Amazon. So-so."
239,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4668882-rachel,3,Interesting but it didn't really grip me for some reason. Both the main characters are eccentric geniuses from start to finish so there's not a lot of character development going on. There is a bit of humour though especially from the Humboldt's poor assistant who increasingly wants to kill him.
240,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."
241,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"Measuring the World is a historical novel tracking 2 characters, Alexander von Humboldt who travels the world to discover it, and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a mathematician who stays put but travels vaster distances of cosmic discovery to find that space is curved. They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
242,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
243,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Very funny and sometimes moving little historical novel loosely based on the lives and times of (mathematician) Carl Friedrich Gauss and (scientist/adventurer) Alexander von Humboldt, huge success in Germany, doesn't seem to have much love in these parts. "
248,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,3,"The book is about two scientists (who existed in reality), Alexander Von Humboldt and Carl Gauss. The former is an adventurer in the true sense while the latter is a recluse. Despite this difference the two have parallel lives. Both have discovered secrets about the world we live in and it makes them famous. When the two finally meet each other in 1828 they find out that both their talents and current situation (Germany has been annexed to France) have stopped them from continuing their mission to map out the world. Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
249,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "
250,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56145680-ari-levine,3,"3.5 stars, rounded down. An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
251,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

252,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
253,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
254,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
255,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
256,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."
257,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617964-ak,3,"A perfectly fine historical novel that I probably would have been more receptive to if I hadn't read Andrea Wulf's excellent (non-fiction) book about Alexander Humboldt, The Invention of Nature, earlier this year. With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character.

What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."

It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."

I'm pretty sure that if I was German, or read this book in German, I would have found it even funnier. Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists.

It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."

The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"

266,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."

270,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83849229-klaus,3,"(German version below) German world bestseller. Praised by critics as a sensation... but for me it's been quite a disappointment. I loved Kehlmann's Tyll but I never warmed up towards this one.  ""Measuring the World"" is a double biography of two titans of science: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Alexander von Humbold, who, however, come across in this work far from titanic. Although Kehlmann presents their genius appropriately, they apparently have no positive qualities apart from curiosity - instead they come across as comic sociopaths, egomaniacs and cholerics. Gauss makes his family's life hell, even misses the birth of his first child without even knowing about it and reacts with equanimity to the misfortune that hits his son. Alexander von Humbold, the great fighter against slavery and oppression, who with his lectures and anecdotes is said to have been the throbbing heart of every evening society, is demoted by Kehlmann to a homosexual paedophile who is completely unable to feel empathy for his fellow human beings. If one already writes about historical personalities, one should at least stick to the known facts - and in my opinion Kehlmann has not done so quite often here. Among other things, Humbold also deals with the daguerreotype, which in his lifetime was, as far as I know, not thought of yet. Another disturbing factor in this novel was the dialogues, because they are written almost continuously in indirect speech. Why the hell do you write dialogues in indirect speech? In ""Tyll"" Kehlmann has written great dialogues, here they sometimes are as boring as a used chewing gum. Apart from that, the author is still a great narrator. All the embarrassing moments of social failure of the two protagonists are underpinned with fine, subtle irony, and towards the end of his novel Kehlmann elegantly brings both narrative strands together to make it clear that the two geniuses, despite their world-changing insights, are already outdated and old-fashioned in their old age: science is merciless, it evolves. Sensational discoveries of today are the old stories of yesterday, in which no one is interested anymore.  All in all, this is still a novel worth reading, when one has overcome the difficulty with the dialogues and thus realizes that everything interpersonal does not matter in it. Kehlmann is obviously not concerned with the lives of his characters, but with what they leave behind: the measuring of the world, the further development of science and knowledge, the expansion of the human horizon. Three stars.  German: Deutschsprachiger Weltbestseller. Von Kritikern hochgelobt, als ""geniale Sensation"" verschrien...aber für mich eine ziemliche Enttäuschung. Kehlmanns ""Tyll"" habe ich geliebt, aber mit diesem hier wurde ich nie warm.""Die Vermessung der Welt"" ist eine Doppelbiografie zu zwei Titanen der Wissenschaft: Carl Friedrich Gauß und Alexander von Humbold, die in diesem Machwerk allerdings alles andere als titanisch herüberkommen. Zwar stellt Kehlmann ihr Genie angemessen dar, allerdings haben sie abgesehen von ihrer Intelligenz und ihrer Neugier keine positiven Eigenschaften - stattdessen kommen sie als überzeichnete Soziopathen, Egomanen und Choleriker daher. Gauß macht seiner Familie das Leben zur Hölle, verpasst sogar die Geburt seines ersten Kindes, ohne davon überhaupt zu wissen, und reagiert mit Gleichmut auf das Unglück, das seinen Sohn trifft. Alexander von Humbold, der große Kämpfer gegen Sklaverei und Unterdrückung, der mit seinen Vorträgen und Anekdoten das pochende Herz jeder Abendgesellschaft gewesen sein soll, wird von Kehlmann zu einem homosexuellen Pädophilen degradiert, der völlig außerstande ist, Empathie für seine Mitmenschen zu empfinden. Wenn man schon über historische Persönlichkeiten schreibt, sollte man sich wenigstens an die bekannten Fakten halten - und das hat Kehlmann hier meiner Meinung nach ziemlich oft nicht getan. Unter anderem beschäftigt sich Humbold hier auch mit der Daguerreotypie, was zu seinen Lebzeiten soweit ich weiß noch absolute Zukunftsmusik war.Ein anderer Störfaktor in diesem Roman waren die Dialoge, denn diese sind fast durchgehend in indirekter Rede verfasst. Warum zum Teufel schreibt man Dialoge in indirekter Rede? In ""Tyll"" hat Kehlmann großartige Dialoge geschrieben, hier ziehen sie sich teilweise wie Kaugummi.Davon abgesehen ist der Autor auch hier immer noch ein großartiger Erzähler. All die peinlichen Momente sozialen Versagens der beiden Protagonisten sind mit feiner, subtiler Ironie unterlegt, und zum Ende seines Romans hin führt Kehlmann beide Erzählstränge elegant zusammen um zu verdeutlichen, dass die beiden Genies trotz ihrer weltverändernden Erkenntnisse im Alter doch nur überholte Greise sind: die Wissenschaft ist gnadenlos, sie entwickelt sich immer weiter. Sensationelle Entdeckungen von heute sind die alten Geschichten von gestern, für die sich niemand mehr interessiert.Alles in allem ist das hier immer noch ein lesenswerter Roman, wenn man die Schwierigkeit mit den Dialogen überwunden hat und damit klarkommt, dass alles Zwischenmenschliche in ihm keine Rolle spielt. Kehlmann geht es hier offenbar nicht um das Leben seiner Charaktere, sondern um das, was sie hinterlassen: die Vermessung der Welt, die Weiterentwicklung von Wissenschaft und Wissen, das Erweitern des menschlichen Horizonts. Drei Sterne."

They both are driven by the thought ""Whenever things were frightening, it was a good idea to measure them."" Their 2 journeys of discovery, one by way of jungle treks, river voyages, and mountain climbing, the other by way of telescope and elegant equations calculating the movement of light and the shape of space, come together in Berlin in 1828, the predictable finale of 2 careers made into a story part adventure and part novel of ideas. It's also, given its setting during the Napoleonic age, romantic, with a generous incorporation of humor, especially in those characters around Humboldt. He was a guy who needed a sidekick."
272,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25885530-vanessa,4,"Yeah, this surprised the hell out of me. I'll be honest. This book bored me to death the first about 80 pages. I put it down for a few days, even thought I wouldn't finish it. I guess I just couldn't see the point - it seemed tons of information dump without deeper themes or interesting characterization. And sure, there was the subtle humor that has been praised about this book, but that alone can't carry the whole thing. So I thought. And then continued after all because I don't like dnf'ing books. And slowly started being a little interested. And then the last 100 pages were just - fantastic. I don't think I've ever done such a complete 180 on a book, and it kind of confuses me. But this story really builds on itself and becomes more complex and intriguing and really comes together at the end with its themes. And they are actually........really really fascinating. Okay, so I'll try to explain. I knew from the go that Kehlmann wasn't just writing an ~ode to imagination and the scientific spirit~ as you might think from the synopsis - in fact, even though the novel often seems almost like a parody, with the ridiculous dialogues where people completely talk past each other - what really characterizes it is a radical sense of realism. 'One scientist discovers something and then the next generation knows even more until it's all over', is basically what Humboldt says toward the end. The story, step by step, completely demystifies history and the heroification of historical people by depicting the real, sometimes tragic, but oftentimes ridiculous and completely random nature of human life, and the way it just goes on and doesn't really have a point or purpose and then gets replaced by the next generation which inevitably knows and dicovers more and has a wider worldview and leaves the last generation who thought THEY revolutionized the world, behind completely. It's this last idea that really stuck with me. You might disagree with me but to me this novel is ultimately about time, its inevitable movement and the resulting struggles of aging and being replaced. Both Humboldt and Gauß are depicted at the beginning as misunderstood revolutionaries who do these great things that no one has ever done before - Humboldt with his travels, Gauß with his mathematical discoveries. No one really CARES about what they're doing in the beginning, or they only care about what seems interesting to them, not what's really important. (which is still kinda how most people see science today. when it's popularized and easy, it's cool, but no one actually cares in a deeper way). They're the typical Misunderstood Genius trope (even though they both deal with it in different ways).And then the world catches up and they're famous, and they're at these meetings and gatherings with empty conversations and suddenly their image is more important than their actual actions. And when they try to work again, like Humboldt did at the end, they discover that they have effectively been replaced by the younger generation, and they're just there for representative functions, more as a myth than anything else. They've become old, and the world has moved on without them. Man, that is CHILLING. That doesn't just represent scientific biographies, it can be applied to life in general. From youthful spirit, from the wish to go wider and deeper and where no one has ever been before (in reality, or with your mind)...to the realization that what you once thought was revolutionary is now something obvious, and the world just mercilessly continues on.Of course, this topic is also interesting against the historical backdrop: coming from the period of enlightenment, where the spirit of discovery was everywhere, to the complicated political landscape that came with Napoleon, to the sort of lazy years of restauration in Germany in the early 19th century. It's all very easily built into the story and characterizes the mood in the different parts of the story. I don't think this story would've worked with these themes that I just mentioned if it took place in any different time. It fits perfectly.So, yeah. I'm almost tempted to give it 5 stars because of this thematic point of time and the ~cycle of life~, leaving me behind with a sort of wide, melancholy feeling that I just LOVE. I truly think Kehlman (whose writing I really had my beef with in the past, but it works here really well) has created something masterful here. But the fact stands that the beginning is boring as hell, and some of the details were just uninteresting. I get that it's part of the larger realism of the story. But man, if I'm almost tempted to put a book down toward the middle, it would've needed to be a little more exciting. But as it is, I'm so glad I didn't. This is a strong 4 stars. "
273,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51470171-istvan-zoltan,1,"This is a very treacherous book. It sells itself off as a historical novel, as something that presents the lives and work of two great figures of the history of science, Humboldt and Gauss. It actually does that but the account it provides is wholly fictional. It is based on shoddy understanding of their work, on misleading and inaccurate presentations of their thoughts and ideas. The book conveys entirely wrong impressions of both Humboldt's and Gauss's character and place all emphasis in wrong places thereby distorting the weight of certain events and views in their life and belittling others which would merit more attention.It is treacherous because at the same time it is decently written, it reads easily, it is in places quite entertaining and there are dramatic and emotional turns in it. The problem is that it is not true. It is hard to read a book that is supposed to be about two persons who have existed while having to remind yourself all the time during reading that you shouldn't take what is written seriously about them, it is just fiction. If I want to read good fiction there are plenty of chances for it, and I will do that. What I certainly don't want to do is to read a false, misleading account of two peoples' lives whose times, deeds and achievements are well documented and well known. I do not recommend this book.Another aspect which I haven't mentioned yet is that while the style is at the beginning entertaining it gets old before long. The jokes are repetitious, the characters are just templates of the 'mad scientist' and the 'miserable genius'. There isn't anything original, plastic, life-like about them. Kehlmann's writing is full of Hollywood-style bestseller clichés. It doesn't aid understanding of a very different age and world. Rather it caters to people who are lazy and would like to believe that Humboldt's and Gauss's day wasn't different in anything from the world of contemporary rom-coms. The lack of detail, depth and carefulness permeats everything. Descriptions of places, surroundings, interactions between people and records of their behaviour. Kehlmann tries to hide behind the claim that this is fiction. Well, this isn't fiction, this is shoddy crafstmanship.I'm including a link to a careful review that lists many of the factual inaccuracies and the harms the book does. It is written in German but includes an abstract in English and Spanish.http://www.uni-potsdam.de/romanistik/..."

The conceit is that both ""great men"" of science were fascinated with measuring the world. One, by getting out there and venturing into the hitherto unexplored hinterlands of South America; the other a homebody, who can barely tolerate leaving his home.Their differing personalities are deftly brought to life, with a healthy dose of humour. This helps, as there is plenty of philosophical and scientific meanderings on both geographical perspectives and spatial assumptions, and the Gauss sections in particular explore some heady theoretical physics.Another contender for the best I read this year, I'd wager."

Add to that guest appearances by Kant, Schiller, Thomas Jefferson and you do get quite an interesting story in your hands.As such the novel is divided into two halves. One focuses on the early life of the scientists. Humboldt’s journey through South America, which is a highpoint of the book, and Gauss’ martial problems. The second half is about the grim reality posed by a French occupied Germany and the trappings of fame. I admit that in this part the book drags a bit and loses the verve it had in the beginning. Just like it’s two protagonists I suppose.A bestseller in Germany, Measuring the World, is a page turner filled with moments of sly humour and a restless energy. Kehlmann avoids cliches so it does makes fresh reading. Not too clever but with a brain, it is one of those books that caters for all types of people and, in my case, was a pleasant surprise."
279,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644754-laurenthompson,2,"Although I did not enjoy this book, Measuring the World had good intentions. This book portrays two brilliant minds of the 18th century, Alexander Humboldt and Carl Gauss.For Humboldt and Gauss their gift is also their curse. There brilliance isolates them from the world and all those in it. It is interesting to see the world from this point of view. To think that something like knowledge, which is a highly desired trait many wish to have, can actually be a curse. Though the author brings up this interesting topic it is not enough to carry the book along. The author intended these two characters to be comical but I found them a bit dry. The most exciting parts of the book were Humboldt's adventures. All together I thought this book was a little too dull for my liking. The humor was not as apparent as other reviews made it out to be. I would not suggest this book for teenagers unless they have an interest in history. "

An extremely dry (the vermouth never comes into direct contact with the gin, but I will assume that this astringency of tone was the translator's decision) comic novel about the known unknowns of the Enlightenment project. Kehlmann turns Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss into ridiculously un-self-aware and pompous clowns who clumsily stumble through South America and German academia in their quest to quantify the world and the universe, yet have no capacity for building mental models of their fellow humans. Some bizarre magic-realist flights, too: hallucinations and delusions that undermine their cool, calm, almost inhuman rationality. Did make me somewhat curious to explore the author's later novels, such as F and the just-published Tyll."
281,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114072896-anna-a,5,"A German Sumeru ConundrumKehlmann is my new favorite author.Measuring the World is a parallel fictionalization of two great biographies, of two great (and fragile and weak and in all ways human) men for whom Kehlmann creates an opportunity to meet: C.F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. In most ways they are different: one of them hates to leave his home, the other can’t stay in the same place for too long. One explores the theoretical, the other relishes in the visible. One needs a spouse to support him in the daily needs of life; the other needs nobody but his instruments. They share one thing: their trust that the world, either abstract, or palpable, is there for them to discover.So Kehlmann embarks them on a path of discovery told in third person, with bittersweet wit that – just as in Tyll – is devoid of cynicism. The absence of dialogue punctuation marks lends the narrative a stream-of-consciousness feel, and is often a source of humor.The braided storylines first converge in the opening chapter that shows the two mighty scholars in their pathetic human frailty. After this initial entertaining junction, we are treated to their individual stories in alternating chapters. Their fictitious meeting culminates in a more dramatic, dreamlike chapter that reads both like a monologue of each of them, but also like their dialogue.The conclusion echoes the Sumeru mountain myth explored by Paolo Cognetti in The Eight Mountains, juxtaposing the two possibilities of discovery: the peregrinator’s, who has been to all the mountains, and the homebird’s, who has reached the summit of the greatest mountain.
But as the first suburbs of Berlin flew past and Humboldt imagined Gauss at that very moment staring through his telescope at heavenly bodies, whose paths he could sum up in simple formulas, all of a sudden he could no longer have said which of them had traveled afar and which of them had always stayed at home.

282,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"A brilliant writer! This is a novel in the form of a double biography--of Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss. In concept the book reminded me a bit of the double biography by Nancy Faraday: Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics or even more of Schama's book Rembrandt's Eyes about Rubens and Rembrandt. Sometimes you can understand someone best by looking at their life through the lens of someone quite different--and that is certainly the case of this novel about the adventures of two geniuses. The writing is GORGEOUS! And as my friend Brooks reminded me, very economical. I can't wait to read Tyll!"
283,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27135085-chelsea-mcgill,2,"Alexander von Humboldt is an obsessive, highly trained all-around scientist who constantly measures, observes, and records all kinds of data. He sets off for South America with the goal of discovering the inland connection between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, observing air pressures at different altitudes, and determining whether the earth is really made up of water. All of this is described in letters to his brother, a high-ranking politician in Germany, which are published in the newspapers.Carl Friedrich Gauss has an innate capacity for numbers that allows him to make the greatest mathematical discoveries since Newton, in fields ranging from algebra to geodesy to astronomy. Unfortunately, he is also an ass to those around him, especially when he feels they think too slowly to keep up with him.Alternating between the stories of these two men, Kehlmann tells an ironic, drily humorous story that is as much about science as it is about interpersonal relationships and learned German society in the early 19th century.The Man of Science as Emotionless Beast Like many other authors and television shows (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), this novel depicts these two highly intelligent men as emotionally distant, often rude jerks. Humboldt, for example, often treats his good friend and traveling companion Aime Bonpland as a servant, refusing to take breaks from their adventure even when he is ill. In fact, Humboldt shows more affection for a stray dog that he adopts than he does for any of the people around him. Like Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, this is often played for laughs - but I didn't find it amusing. I felt rather sorry for Humboldt, who seems to have several mental disorders, not to mention his seemingly repressed homosexuality.Read the rest of my review here: http://thegloballycurious.blogspot.in..."
284,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165865-manuel-batsching,3,"There was quite a hype about this book and it's author a few years ago and so I was inevitably prejudiced when I opened it.What I appreciate about this book is its sense of humor (the dialog with Kant is hilarious) and the idea to deliberately avoid direct speech in order to make the language resemble rather a travel report than a novel. This certainly adds to the athmosphere, especially of the Humboldt chapters.At the same time I find it hard to follow those people, who read this book as a character study or biography of either Humboldt or Gauß. Not only does the author declare in interviews that he deliberately took some liberties when it comes to historical accuracy, but there is also a paragraph in the book, that I take to be an ironical reference to this matter. In that paragraph Kehlmann lets Gauß display his disgust for novels, that get lost in a sea of lies, as the author attaches his own whim to the names of historical figures (""[...] Romane, die sich in Lügenmärchen verlören, weil der Verfasser seine Flausen an die Namen geschichtlicher Personen binde"" (p. 221)). I must confess, that any deeper layers of the book, like the assumed statement on ""German-ness"" or any deeper philosophical implications remained hidden to me. Where the reference to some philosophical thought was done openly (as the reference to La Mettrie's attempt of a pure mechanistic explanation of mental processes) it seemed to me rather random.Given the degree to which this book was praised in the media, I don't know if it was unwillingness or mere ignorance on my part that made me read this apparently profound piece of literature merely as a mediocre but still enjoyable historical fiction."
285,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is Daniel's most popular novel, selling more than 2 million copies world wide, and I think it is obvious why. In this novel, Daniel departs from his overly literary offerings, and wrote an enjoyable fictional biography of two eminent German men-of-letters, explorer and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt (1767-1835) and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855). I thought the novel was a joy to read, and if I assume that Daniel remained respectful to his subject, I learnt a lot about Alexander's and Carl's personalities and achievements in the process. As I said, I do not think this novel is about something, it is not a metaphor that stands for a deeper idea hiding behind the surface, and it is not a classical literary novel. But it does not have to be - indeed, I think it is almost Daniel's strongest novel to date, a bit weaker than Ich und Kaminsky perhaps, but easily more mature and readable than both Beerholm's Vorstellung and Mahler's Zeit. The only thing I thought was annoying was that Daniel kept foreshadowing the future in the thoughts of his protagonists. Both Humboldt and Gauss repeatedly are shown to have thoughts about what their future would hold, and in comparing these thoughts with our present, Daniel reveals his characters to possess intellectual powers similar to clairvoyance. I found these interjections annoying as neither Humboldt nor Gauss needs such hyperbole to represent their respective achievements as outstanding. Still, apart from this minor niggle, an excellent and enjoyable read."
286,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66891154-sage,3,"it's not the point of the book, but to me a lot of it served as a reminder of just how much of our science is rooted in colonialism and racism. it's apparent in the travels of humboldt and his team, exploring a ""wilderness"" where actual people were already living, often profiting from their knowledge without giving them credit. it becomes especially obvious in the scene where humboldt claims that he basically discovered the poison curare, even though it was obviously discovered and long widely known by the people living in the ""wilderness"" - but it doesn't count as science as long as europeans don't know about it. i suppose it's good to remember that science has never been as apolitical as it wants to be, but always arises from existing political and social structures and can't help but be influenced by them.aside from that (which isn't really a judgement of the book), i mostly liked it. the characters probably weren't historically accurate, but that's okay because that wasn't the intent of the novel. it brought up a number of interesting ideas. the dialogue was hard to read sometimes."
287,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617964-ak,3,"A perfectly fine historical novel that I probably would have been more receptive to if I hadn't read Andrea Wulf's excellent (non-fiction) book about Alexander Humboldt, The Invention of Nature, earlier this year. With her vivid and expansive account of Humboldt's life and times fresh on my mind, Kehlmann's take on Humboldt seemed thin. It's supposed to be comic, but the humor had basically two notes- ""virgins are so naive, haha!"" and ""Germans, am I right?"" The sections on Gauss had some other humorous elements, like about he's socially oblivious (mathematicians, am I right?) and also mean to his children (see previous.) The novel isn't bad, though, and it's easy to see how enjoyable it must be for German or European readers to have a little harmless fun at the expense of some national heroes and the national character. "
288,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1204244-karen,2,"This was a must-read for a physicist spending the year in Göttingen on a Humboldt Fellowship: the lives of Gauss and Humboldt intertwined. What fascinating lives, and what a clever tale to jointly spin! Unfortunately (and this may have been due to a poor translation?), I found the book to be very poorly written. Furthermore, the character development was shoddy, with colleagues and relatives popping into the story without sufficient exposition as to who/what they were. And these characters really existed! It did inspire future reading-list additions: I want to find a real biography of each, and to improve my German to the point where I can decide whether the author or the translator was at fault."
289,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19603487-pep-bonet,4,"Very interesting. I discovered Kehlmann recently through a review in a Swiss journal and read Les Friedland. I was disappointed. It was nice, but I didn't get into it. Measuring the world is another type of book. Two strong personalities alternate in a story in which both German scientists only meet at a certain point and two completely, radically different views on what measuring the world might mean, coexist: Gauss measuring from home without moving and von Humboldt travelling across the world as one of the last of his species."
290,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/478700-kylie-sparks,3,"This was an enjoyable and mildly amusing read for me. I'm pretty sure that if I was German, or read this book in German, I would have found it even funnier. Although I hate it when people say books lost in translation just because they didn't like them---but in this case, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of cultural references I didn't get. But what I got was philosophical and funny. I didn't realize until the end of the book that these characters were actually based on real scientists. It gave me an appreciation for how we know so many of the things we know about the world--what a crazy process of discovery it was."
291,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287856-david,4,"I like books that have short chapters and don't wallow in endless description. This is one. It was also a big deal in Germany.The story is about the explorer Humboldt and the mathematician Gauss, beginning and ending in alternating chapters, with their interaction somewhere in the middle. They contrast: extrovert vs introvert, aristocrat vs commoner, observer v theorizer, usw. There are other themes here: aging, the meaning of life, the succession of generations, class, absolutism and much else. It's short, moves along, and provides food for thought. What more could you want? Sex, violence, and dragons, you say? Read a different book..."
292,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843716-andrea,5,"this book was a fine and immensely fascinating and satisfying read!i read it in one setting last nite, even stayed up late to finish it! it's that kind of book! you learn a lot about living 200 years ago, when there were no dentists, only sailboats and berlin a small town with mostly huts and dirty streets! and at the same time you are entertained! this book was a mega-bestseller in germany, he has a new book coming out called ""fame"", which deals with the protection of privacy in parts! i have never read him, have you?"
293,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4687834-eadie,4,"I found this book to be rather charming. It's a double biography of two not very well known scientists, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is an adventure tale as Humboldt did a lot of travel while measuring the world. Gauss believed that ""a man alone at his desk"" represented the real scientist. There is a lot of inside German jokes which adds some humor to the book. I would highly recommend this book to those who love science and love to travel."
294,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"Although I love stories about great scientists, this is a disappointment to say the least. The story itself is pretty unremarkable, which is ok if they are true. But if you read some of the analysis out there, most of the stuff is completely made up. For instance Gauss is portrayed as a grumpy old man. And there is significant doubt about that. It is a surprise that the original German version is a bit hit. Maybe compared to Kant, this seems a lot funnier?"
295,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54550030-cliff-esler,3,"It held my interest, and Daniel Kehlmann is certainly a good writer, but in some ways it seemed like a kind of absurdist story of two obsessive and half-crazed geniuses who neglected others while seeking to immortalize themselves and their reputations. In other words, a good read, but not necessarily so deserving of all the grandiloquent review blurbs that appeared on the cover."
296,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth,3,"I found this book interesting but not riveting. This may be because the structure of telling the parallel stories of two German scientists from the 19th century is maintained at the expense of a satisfying plot. Or perhaps the use of reported speech rather than dialogue became tiresome. I think perhaps the novelty made this a best seller, but that wasn't enough for me."
297,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39720114-jamie-z,2,"Full disclosure - this book was listed under non-fiction via my local digital library. It is not...it is a rough history significantly embellished with fictionalized narrative. I do not enjoy this genre. I can tolerate Erik Larson, but this book does not measure to that standard. It was rather disjointed and I would not recommend it."
298,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1031754-jen,3,"Interesting scientific fiction, but the characters are not very likeable and overall it's a bit of a downer. It's about two 19th C. German scientists, and one of them goes on a trip to the Amazon. So-so."
299,0375424466,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4668882-rachel,3,Interesting but it didn't really grip me for some reason. Both the main characters are eccentric geniuses from start to finish so there's not a lot of character development going on. There is a bit of humour though especially from the Humboldt's poor assistant who increasingly wants to kill him.
