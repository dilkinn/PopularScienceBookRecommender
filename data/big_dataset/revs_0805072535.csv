0,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,2,"People make positive statements more often than negative ones and want to clearly distinguish between the two; therefore, it makes sense for a language to have a ""not"" morpheme. A language usually has 10 to 100 phonemes; even if there are some languages that go outside these bounds, no human language has a million phonemes: no one could ever learn it. Latin had three grammatical genders; most Latin-derived Romance languages have two, with the neuter merging into the masculine, and Romanian retains all three, but no Romance language has developed twenty-some gender-number combinations like Bantu languages have, including the plant gender and the abstract nouns gender. Living Indo-European languages are much more grammatically diverse than Romance languages, but they still retain some vestiges of Proto-Indo-European grammar; none of them are like Chinese grammatically. It is possible that likewise, all human languages have shared features that remain from the last shared human languages. If we look at linguistic universal and near-universals, some of them will be adaptive, some will follow from human biology, and some will be ""frozen accidents"". The same will be true not just for language but for any complex adaptive system such as life. That life is built of carbon and not silicon probably follows from the chemistry of these elements; that all life uses a particular genetic code with extremely minor variations is probably a frozen accident; that most mutations are either neutral or only slightly detrimental to the organism, and may be beneficial in changed circumstances is probably adaptive. Now, how do you distinguish between these cases?Gell-Mann is an elementary particle physicist who did pioneering work in the theory of strong and weak interaction, most famously coining the term ""quark"", and received the 1969 physics Nobel prize. While traveling in South America, he saw a jaguarundi, which is a small wild cat, and was struck by how different it is from the quark. The jaguarundi is an animal that consists of organs, which consist of tissues, which consist of cells, which consist of organelles, which consist of molecules, which consist of atoms, which consist of electrons and nuclei, which consist of nucleons, which consist of quarks. Modulo a few quantum numbers, all quarks are the same; each jaguarundi is a different individual. The behavior of the quark is predictable as much as anything is predictable in quantum physics; that of the jaguarundi is unpredictable. The jaguarundi adapts to its environment; the quark doesn't. Somehow when you travel up the ladder of levels of abstraction, these properties emerge. In order to tackle this mystery, Gell-Mann tries to run through all of science in less than 400 pages, mentioning things like Bell's inequalities from quantum physics, the ecology of different desert biomes, grammatical universals and near-universals from linguistics, spontaneous symmetry breaking from quantum field theory, and more. I don't know who this book is written for. In order to understand the physics part, you need a Ph.D. in high-energy physics, but then you'll know this material already; I doubt that an average biophysicist knows what Gell-Mann is talking about when he says, ""Quantum flavor dynamics and quantum chromodynamics [...] belong to the same class of theories - so-called gauge theories of Yang-Mills theories (as generalized by Shelly Glashow and me long ago.)"" and does not give any further explanations. A reader who is not a physicist certainly won't know what Gell-Mann is talking about. This book mentions in passing Joseph Greenberg's theory of linguistic universals, and says that some universals may be adaptive, some are basic consequences of human biology, and some may be ""frozen accidents"" remaining from the first human language that no generation of speakers could ever alter, but no examples are given. So this is basically an ego trip in book form. We already know that a Physics Nobel laureate must be smart, and know a lot; why write a book about it?"

Thanks Dorian!"
2,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,2,"Gell-Mann is a very intelligent man with wide-ranging interests but his attempts to treat so many of these interests at once really hinder ‘The Quark and The Jaguar’.At times, this book presents fascinating and powerful new ways of looking at the world. Gell-Mann shines when he’s in his element. His introduction to complexity & randomness and complex adaptive systems is excellent and has given me a new lens to view the world through. Also, his introduction to modern physics (Gell-Mann is a Nobel Prize winner who basically built QCD, an essential piece of the current standard model) is one of the clearest I have encountered and debunks the pop culture misinterpretations of quantum mechanics that pervade most discussions.At other times, I felt like I was in one of those dreams where you’re sitting in class minding your own business and, suddenly… your pants are gone! In trying to jump from interest to interest so often, Gell-Mann has to drop introductions to the fundamental background needed to understand what he’s discussing, leading to confusing situations in which the reader has no idea where they are and how they got there.There are certainly interesting nuggets here but this book could do with some editing.Note: 2 stars doesn’t mean I thought this book was “bad”. I follow Goodreads convention and 2 stars means “it was ok”. If I believed in inflated scores for every book, it’d be on Amazon right now.Book Notes * Defining Complexity o coarse/fine grain - level of detail o length of description - possible measure o context dependent - f(vocab, shared knowledge) o algorithmic info content (AIC) - shortest program that produces a string + compressibility - inverse of randomness + AIC = measure of randomness, not complexity  * Meaning of Random 1. incompressible (defined by result) 2. generated by chance (defined by process)  o let’s call 1 random and 2 stochastic o pseudorandom - generated using chaotic or messy process to imitate chance  * Complex Adaptive Systems o Method + old data –> construct theory + present data –> predict + new data –> test & revise  o compress regularities in observation into schema o revise defn. of complexity by length of schema (since only regularities produce schema) o external complexity - book description (good approximation but subject to academic tone, audience experience, etc) o internal effective complexity - brain representation [in native speaker] (better approximation as it is truer to the source) o usefulness = f(observer skill & size of observed set) o regularities identified by class (no algorithm can identify all regularities - Godel?) o high complexity = balance between order & disorder and simple & random (mid-range AIC) o species learning - mutations (variation) present before challenge o brain learning - ideas (variation) created in response to challenge  * More on Complexity & Randomness o self-organized criticality - natural attraction of a system to a critical value o depth - difficulty of moving from compressed program/schema –> full description of result o crypticity - difficulty of moving from full description of result –> compressed program/schema o individuality - bits to describe object > bits to enumerate group  * Intro to Modern Physics o bootstrap principle - assume particles are already there and they give rise to and sustain themselves (*like recursive programming in Scheme!) o QCD differs from QED because gluons are electrically charged and interact with each other unlike photons (so color force doesn’t die with distance and traps quarks) o photons/gravitons transfer energy/motion while W+- bosons seem only to transform particles into their antiparticles o charged particles interact through photons o colored particles interact through gluons o flavored particles interact through W bosons o weak force (W bosons) change flavor AND charge (since W bosons are electrically charged) o renormalization - isolating a portion of a theory to stand on its own as a good approximation (can lead to arbitrary constants dependent upon rest of theory) o superpartners - fermions for bosons & bosons for fermions o supergap - mass difference between superpartners caused by SSB o force unity - extrapolate experiments and gluonic, EM, and weak interactions almost converse at high energies (early BB perhaps?) o action [=] energy * time  * Time o frozen accident - chance events with many long-term consequences + more of universe’s AIC and effective complexity results from accidents than laws + can lead to SSB when chance occurrence is one among a symmetrical set of possibilities + provide regularity –> higher effective complexity + responsible for many environmental & biological conditions  o coarse-grained history - class of all fine-grained histories that meet its class reqs (equivalence of properties in focus, set of all possible alternatives for properties ignored) + ignored properties are ’summed over’ + when interference terms disappear, histories ‘decohere’ + asymmetry between past & future: # radiation (energy flows out) # records (only of past) # entropy (energy of macrostate = bits to represent a microstate)  * Biology, Evolution, and Fitness o evolution (intermingling of species & environment) can be modeled as a movement toward equilibrium of information (like the intermingling of hot & cold gases) o gateway events - dramatic biological events that open new options (photosynthesis, eukaryotes, etc) o fitness landscape - topological representation of biological fitness (as depth) + local minima similar to potential wells (false optimization) + noisy, random path allows movement in/out of wells + basin of attraction - watershed for a well  o inclusive fitness - factors in survival/reproduction of related organisms, weighting the most related most heavily (related to the selfish gene)  Questions * How does the nuclear force arise from the color force? * How does gluon interaction result in the color force not dying with distance? * Do W bosons transfer a ‘force’ or just transform particles to antiparticles? * What makes the fundamental units fundamental? (i.e. fundamental length, mass, etc) * What is Hawking’s ‘initial condition of the universe’ that Gell-Mann repeatedly refers to? * Has anyone made a program that evolves its strategy intelligently based on a predictive brain algorithm? * What about a system that meta-evolves its strategy (i.e. evolves it process for evolving)? Perhaps it shifts from neural net to genetic algorithm, etc. Conclusions * I’m still rooting for Einstein’s ‘hidden variables’ alternative to QM * Complexity is not a well-defined idea but its a very alluring topic and this offers a nice framework to begin thinking about it * ‘Fitness landscapes’ are an incredibly fun way to look at biology through the lens of someone trained in physics but show how reliant we are on space for our models and analogies. This may be a fault for certain problems but heck, I’m a sucker for geometric interpretations. * The deeper you go, the simpler & more elegant physics gets * I still don’t understand entropy nor am I convinced of the second law. I will (skeptically) read more. * Frozen accidents are ubiquitous mysteries peppered throughout our world (and identifying them is a great way to entertain yourself). * Complex adaptive schema are very powerful and should be a fun thing to toy with when I improve my programming. * Coarse-graining is another ubiquitous principle that I’ve overlooked. Graining is a built-in assumption that we make at all times and must be considered in any analysis. "
3,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12006755-paul-brogan,3,"Unless you're a whiz at maths and physics, the first part of this book will be heavy going for you. Fortunately, I have always had a fascination for quarks and quantum theory, Einstein and Heisenberg, calculus and statistical theory, so I found great reward from getting inside the methodical brain of a man such as Gell-Mann, winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize for Physics. (Indeed, it was he who coined the term 'quark', among others.)By the time he moves onto to a discussion of the complex (biological evolution, creativity, superstition, environmental protection, and world futures), however, I suspect that even the technical maladroit would find something of immense value from his thorough and analytical musings on the state of both humankind and our planet. This said, I was glad I took the trouble to plough through those early chapters, without which I may have missed the precision that he uses to describe terms such as order and disorder, randomness, simple and complex, depth, and entropy, and without which I think I may have lost much of the beautiful logic of his conclusions.This is an ideal book to lend to your favourite scientist or engineer friend. When finished, invite him or her for dinner, drinks, and plenty of debate over Gell-Mann's ideas. It would be animated, I'm sure, but stimulating. While the universe is in essence quite simple, humans and our society are complex, and that's worth celebrating."
4,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,2,"""The Quark and the Jaguar"" is an engaging account of the life-long intellectual pilgrimage of Murray Gell-man , winner of 1969 Nobel Prize for Physics. Gell-mann was the first person to postulate the existence of Quarks and ranks as one of the all-time greats in the field of quantum mechanics. In 1984, he co-founded the Santa Fe institute which is dedicated to the physical, computational, biological, linguistic and social components of complex adaptive systems. The jury is still out on the accomplishments of this initiative which unfortunately occupy most of the this book.Above-all, ""The Quark and the Jaguar"" seems dated. Gell-mann wrote the book at a time when the discipline of quantum mechanics had arrived at plateau. In the last 50 years, the scientific community has come a long way in explaining quantum mechanics to high school students and members of the general public. The general reader can now find better explanations elsewhere. The passages on complex adaptive systems suffer from the inverse problem. The discipline was in its infancy at the time Gell-mann was writing and his comments in this area are not terribly enlightening at this point in time twenty-five years after the publication of the ""The Quark and the Jaguar."" ""The Quark and the Jaguar"" is a ghastly muddle for any lay reader wishing to educate himself or herself about either quantum mechanics or complex adaptive systems. What it does offer the reader interested in the history of quantum mechanics is access to the personality, charm and thinking processes of one the great physicists of the 20th century."
5,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/640661-brian-godsey,5,"I got this book as a prize from the math department of my college when I was a freshman or a sophomore. Though I liked the idea of learning more about quarks, I had a habit of not reading anything that wasn't required of me. So, The Quark and the Jaguar sat on my shelf for almost a decade before I took it seriously, and I'm glad for that---both that I took it seriously and that I waited so long.I'm glad that I [finally] took the book seriously because there's a ton of good information and ideas in there. I'm glad that I waited because I think that even a couple of years ago I would not have fully understood or appreciated most of it. Four years ago, I had only basic knowledge of physics, biology, genetics, evolution, machine learning, probability, and political science, all of which are discussed in this Nobel Prize winner's book. In these last four years, I've learned a lot about all of these topics, not that it's really necessary for understanding the book; it definitely helps appreciate its importance, though.Strictly speaking, The Quark and the Jaguar is about learning, albeit three distinct types of learning: (1) humans learning about our world and universe, (2) our world and universe learning what laws, rules, and configurations can function in the long run, and (3) computers designed by humans learning from data. Learning type (1) is obviously what Gell-Mann has done for most of his lifetime as a theoretical physicist and general applied scientist. Learning type (2) is what Gell-Mann has discovered in his lifetime as a scientist: that every system in our universe---from quantum physics to genetic evolution to economics---is an example or result of that system having tried many possibilities and settling on the few that work. The theory and literature on learning type (3) provide the necessary framework and terminology with which we can discuss learning types (1) and (2), since, in essence, all three types are one and the same, but with different physical objects at the center. Gell-Mann calls these objects ""complex adaptive systems"" and demonstrates how a machine learning algorithm can be very much like the process of evolution, the training of a dog, or even the settling of our cosmos into the physical laws we know and accept today.The breadth of this book is incredible---especially since it's less than 400 pages---and what's even more amazing is that my only complaint about this book is that it was sometimes redundant and written at a level below my current scientific knowledge. It's clearly a book written for people who are not experts in any of the aforementioned fields, but Gell-Mann manages to make it relevant also for them. The only scientifically difficult subject matter is on information theory or quantum physics, and these pages are by no means necessary to the rest of the book.The best aspect of the book, though, which is referenced throughout but becomes clear near the end, is that Gell-Mann tells people in no uncertain terms to look at the big picture, an action that seems incredibly uncommon in the world at large. Not only does he stress this for science, but he tells us how to do it in our everyday lives---work, community, environment, and politics included. There's even a concise summary chapter at the end in case you missed the message in between the examples throughout the book.What I'm left with in the end is a strong feeling that the world and universe are largely a product of learning and chance, the two aspects of every valuable complex adaptive system. I am a product of this universe, and I operate the same way. If I learn how to learn and convince others to do the same, I can be successful or change the world, or both, whichever I prefer."
6,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578536-ty,2,"i picked up this book by Murray Gell-Mann because i thought i would get some interesting discussions on particle physics...after all, Gell-Mann won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969...he named the ""quark""...and maybe the middle 3rd of the book did discuss this sort of thing, along with cosmology, astrophysics and such. the 1st third focused mainly on Gell-Mann's theories about complex adaptive systems and his attempts to show that self-organizing structures, like galaxies, stars, planets, etc. are really similar to cells, ants, mammals, societies and economies. an interesting thesis, but somewhat beat to death over the course of 100+ pages.Gell-Mann uses the final 3rd of the book to muse on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from the debunking of paranormal activities, to environmentalism, to evoloution, to learning computing models, ad infinitum. basically, this was a tough read...kind of like getting your fiber by eating the Cheerios...and the box. not recommended unless you are looking to improve your sleeping habits."
7,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"Gell-Mann has a Nobel Prize in physics. He’s the co-discoverer of quarks, and the one who named them quarks. Quarks and jaguars represent simplicity and complexity, respectively. The book claims to be about the connection between the simplicity of the fundamental laws of physics and the complexity of the natural word – but I didn’t quite get the purported connection. The book, however, is full of interesting musings on a widely diverse set of subjects – from quantum physics to the preservation of cultural diversity. I saw this poem by John Updike about neutrinos in the book. Neutrinos are elementary particles with no electric charge and almost no mass. They almost don’t interact with anything and thus pass through ordinary matter undetected. The thermonuclear reactions in the center of the sun produce neutrinos that rain down upon us during the day. During the night, with the sun behind our planet, these neutrinos pass straight through the earth and rain up upon us from below. Neutrinos, they are very small.They have no charge and have no massAnd do not interact at all.The earth is just a silly ballTo them, through which they simply pass,Like dustmaids down a drafty hallOr photons through a sheet of glass.They snub the most exquisite gas,Ignore the most substantial wall,Cold shoulder steel and sounding brass,Insult the stallion in his stall,And, scorning barriers of class,Infiltrate you and me. Like tallAnd painless guillotines they fallDown through our heads into the grass.At night, they enter at NepalAnd pierce the lover and his lassFrom underneath the bed — you callIt wonderful; I call it crass."
8,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1690774-carol,4,"I am re-reading this after about 10 years. Why hasn't anyone else checked it out of the library during that time. It is very provocative. Murray Gell-Mann is a theoretical physicist who won the Nobel Prize for predicting the quark. He also has a strong interest in biology, evolution, conservation, natural history, and anthropology. This book is linking all of these interests together. He centers on ""complex adaptive systems"", which can be bacteria developing immunity to antibiotics, a person learning from experience, cultures evolving, etc. How does life emerge from non-life? How do species differentiate? How does intellegence emerge when life evolves to a certain level of complexity? All these things are made of quarks, a few simple particles, yet look what variety and complexity comes out of this! It is OK to skim certain chapters if you find them too technical (for instance, he spends a lot of words formulating a technical definition of ""complex""), but don't give up on the book: Just skip these parts and look for the main ideas. It is awesome! "
9,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3036083-steve,4,"In the spirit of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle I'm not sure whether to give this book a 3 or a 5. Gell-Mann covers a lot of ground. He begins with adaptive complex systems veers to quantum theory QED and QCD and then to most other things in the universe language, creative thinking, rain forests and more.In reading this book, it would be put to best use by trying to think in broad sweeps of the mind and see where Gell-Manns general concepts could be applied to your own discipline or complex problems you are working on. Your mind can not be a passive acquirer of factoids while reading this book, but needs to be an active participant in the creative thinking process."
10,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,5,"This is the book that goes the farthest to disprove John Wheeler’s quote “if you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it.” Accessible and yet profound, Mr. Gell-Mann takes the ‘mystic’ out of quan*t*u*m* ph*ysic*s."
11,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475030-iancu-s,2,"Many interesting individual chapters, but this particular jaguar has bitten off more than he can chew. An erudite author with far-reaching interests, but who does not fully tie them all together coherently in the book. Some of the technical discussions on quantum mechanics are too hard for a lay reader (and, I would venture a guess, too easy for the specialist). One example: we're being told that it's the *heterotic* variety of string theory that is a good candidate for a grand unified theory, before we're being told what string theory is. Similar for other presumably deep theoretical points (bootstrap principle, Hawking-Hartle no boundary condition etc) - one gets a sense that they do heavy lifting in certain theories, but I wasn't able to get easily behind the key intuitions, at least as explained here."
12,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22173481-buddy-don,3,"I found this fascinating reading until the final two chapters, when Gell-Mann attempts to describe what should be done to maintain a stable world for complex adaptive systems to thrive. It took me weeks to get through those chapters. The others were truly fascinating, creating an amazing world-view.I wish this book had notes and a bibliography. It would have benefited greatly."

19,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53379887-tim-sharp,3,"I encountered this book after reading Daniel Dennett's offhand reference to it as one of the clearest explanations of the quantum world. Having finished it I would have to agree, but with some qualifiers. You can't deny Murray Gell-Man's unimpeachable knowledge of quantum physics and the structures of the cosmos, nor his overwhelming appetites as an intellectual omnivore. Throughout the book we zigzag through dozens of disparate fields, from linguistics to computer science to logic to history to mathematics to biology, sometimes within the space of a couple of pages. You get the sense that Gell-Mann is a man for whom complexity has become a kind of great siphon, sucking in everything it encounters and spinning it into a vast galactic web of interconnected disciplines. The basic premise, that complex structures influence and repeat one another from the micro to the macro in a kind of fractal patterning, is interesting, but at times Gell-Mann seems so invested in exploring his personal opinions on a specific topic that you kind of lose the forest for the trees. Perhaps that's just a simple consequence of the vast overarching hyper-structure that this book is positing, essentially impossible to grasp all in one go.This was slow going for me, and perhaps this was a personal failing on my part, but I felt that, like Penrose's Neutron-Star-Dense tome, ""The Road To Reality"", Gell-Mann had spent so long in the fields of advanced mathematics that he assumed a level of understanding that very few of the general public truly possesses. This is a roundabout way of saying that although his explanations of the quantum world were indeed far clearer than almost any other I have encountered, outside of that field I found myself having to supplement the book with a range of texts just so I was sure he and I were speaking the same language.I also feel, if this book had one large problem, it was that there was no real engagement with epistemology or any genuinely meaningful metaphysical concerns, outside of a few references at the tail end, which is an all-too common problem in most of these popular physics books. The scientist shows you a bunch of shiny conceptual rocks, but then fails to tie them together into a pattern that means anything beyond ""this is like this"". Maybe I'm just not an intuitive fan of hardcore materialism, but I much prefer it when scientists are willing to embrace possibilities outside of their internal frames. This is perhaps an unfair criticism, but it was something that I kept stumbling on. Gell-Mann is so firmly tied to the stone of materialism that he doesn't leave a lot of room for anything else. I don't mean I wanted him to start having a Feyerbandesque breakdown, but just a bit more engagement with ideas outside of strict rationalism, if even to dismiss them, would have been appreciated.All in all, I'm glad I read it. Gell-Mann's passion for the cosmos and the natural world is admirable, and I truly appreciated that in the final section you can really feel his deep love of the environment dock almost perfectly with his more abstract ideas about complexity."
20,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44370058-nathaniel,4,"Upon publishing ""Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,"" Hofstadter found that many readers were failing to appreciate the unifying theme of the book, instead viewing it as several quite disparate topics all slapped together in a desultory way. While I didn't get that AT ALL from G.E.B., I do feel this way about ""The Quark and the Jaguar."" Gell-Mann, far-famed physicist and quantum theory pioneer, presents many wonderful ideas here; he emphasizes the fact that biological evolution is just one of many manifestations of complex adaptive systems at work, pointing out (much as Skinner did in his 1981 article ""Selection by Consequences"") that learning is essentially the selection of 'adaptive' schemata during one's lifetime and that evolutionary processes are mirrored by more microcosmic ones like the immune response. He also successfully illustrates how ideas from sundry fields can cross-pollinate to great effect (a line of thought not unexpected from a Santa Fe Institute founder). In particular, I was taken with his application of Sewall Wright's ""adaptive landscapes"" to other domains; here's to hoping humanity can discover ever-greater local maxima! Throughout the book his use of language is precise, and his expository chapter on quantum mechanics/elementary particles is one of the most compact and accessible layman break-downs of that notoriously rarefied subject.The discussion of complexity, chaos, complex systems, etc., I felt was seriously wanting (esp. from a leading bullhorn of the SFI!). Gell-Mann touches on power laws a bit, but falls short of really integrating our understanding of complex systems into the other subject matter. He writes at length about ""algorithmic information content"" and how the complexity of a system is bound up in the length of its complete description, but I feel that introducing complex systems with these concepts can easily stymie the understanding of readers who aren't already familiar with complexity. The ""adaptive"" aspect of his ""complex adaptive systems"" was thoroughly presented, but the ""complex"" part could've done with a bit more fleshing out.Granted, the breadth of Gell-Mann's text necessitates forgoing many niceties to achieve a readable, salable popular-science synthesis. The Q & J is an amazing book by an amazing human being; the worldview he presents in his later chapters and the concerns that he raises therein are incredibly insightful and completely correct (like our need to, erm, internalize externalities). All told, I warmly recommend this book because, topical divergence or disunity notwithstanding, there is absolutely something here for everyone, something enlightening, something improving."
21,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976229-joshua,1,"I love to read science books. The kind that are written for non-scientists, like myself, in plain language with no, or very simple, mathematics. I do not profess to understand all that I read but over the years I have found that each author brings to his or her subject, whether it be quantum physics, cosmology, astronomy, or the biological sciences, a unique explanation which has allowed me to fill in, with each new book, a more complete understanding of that particular science. It was, therefore, a great disappointment to finish Murray Gell-Mann's ambitious opus to realize that it had added absolutely nothing to my knowledge of the cosmos.I think the problem was twofold: First the organization of the chapters and even the writing within the chapters seemed chaotic; jumping about as if he couldn't quite pin his thoughts down long enough to explain the subject with coherence. This made it very difficult to follow. The second problem is that Dr. Gell-Mann does not speak plain. There are many brilliant scientists, some of them Nobel Laureates like Gell-Mann, who are quite able to explain very complex and highly technical subjects with clarity, in an easy, non-vexing style. Gell-Mann's CalTech colleague, the late Richard Feynman, comes immediately to mind. Gell-Mann, with an admitted love of language and its proper use, seemed just too formal, a bit snooty and not very general reader friendly. Concise understanding is fine, but constantly referring to life forms as ""complex adaptive systems"" and humans as IGUS (information gathering and utilizing systems), to name just the most glaring examples, gets quite tiring.This was not a pleasant read; and for all its scope and grandeur, it left me unable to say that I had learned anything new or gained a clearer understanding of what I did know. As I said, most disappointing. "
22,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5294324-franc,4,"I read this book because it was referrenced in an interview with Cormac McCarthy. The author, Murray Gell-Mann is the founder and grand poobah of the Santa Fe Institute where McCarthy is sort of writer in residence and where he's been composing his next novel. I scribbled a lot in the margins and did a lot of underlining and I will be interested to see if any of the themes from this book find their way into McCarthy's ""The Passenger"" whenever it is finally released. For the most part (the quantum theory chapters aside which I'd have been better to have heeded the author's advice and skipped) Gell-Mann does an excellent job of making the complex science accessible to the lay reader. For us English Majors he brings in examples from other fields such as Shakespeare and the proverbial monkeys with typewriters in discussing current theory on randomness; to explain context-dependence, he cites a great line from the James Thurber story “The Glass in the Field” in which one goldfinch gives a concise account to other birds of a collision with a pane of glass: “I was flying across a meadow when all of a sudden the air crystallized on me;” he also spends some time discussing Jorge Luis Borges magnificent story ""The Garden of Forking Paths in his chapter on decoherent histories and other current thinking about the nature of time.He ends with a very interesting perspective on the future of sustainability which could stand alone as a strong essay and is worthwhile reading even if one bogs down in the previous 329p. of science.

23,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5092531-georgia-roybal,3,"This book is an interesting book discussing lots of physics concepts. One particular concept emphasized was the distinction between simple and complex systems. This gave me another framework to define what I look at in the world. He repeatedly emphasizes that the tendency is toward complex systems. At times the book was a little difficult, but not often enough to stop reading it. Here are some quotes I particularly liked from the book:""The rich lore, as well as institutions and ways of life, of indigenous peoples around the world constitute a treasure house of information about the possibilities of human organization and modes of thought. Many of them also possess precious knowledge of how to live as part of a tropical ecological community.""""Imagine, though, the knowledge of the properties of plants in the minds of certain tribal shamans."" ""Unfortunately that information explosion is in great part a misinformation explosion.""""It is hard to see how quality of life can be sustainable in the long run if it is very inequitably shared....""""...we know that cultural evolution, which is much more rapid, can modify biological propensities.""""...evolution toward planetary consciousness must accommodate cultural diversity.""""...the importance of bottom-upas opposed to top-down initiatives. If local people are deeply involved in a process, if they help to organize it, and if they have a perceived stake, especially an economic stake, in the outcome, then the process often has a better chance of success..."""
24,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4263334-jan,3,"A very good book on quantum physics, evolution and - above all - Complex Adaptive Systems, however, in need of better editor. But, what do you want of a book from the early '90's, when sustainability (and writing for the internet - he is talking about ""electronic mail"", like we did in the beginning) was still a long way out. Because he is a genial scientist as well as a perfectionist, he makes himself hard to understand. He will not cut corners to make it easy understandable. For instance his remark on Feynman Diagrams, a great mnemonic tool: ""funny little pictures, giving the illusion of understanding what is going on"" (p 178). It is a pity that such a brilliant man will never be as popular as Einstein of Feynman, just because he wants to be general, simple and accurate at the same time. Sacrificing simplicity. You can just skip or browse the quantum part and read how he develops the theme of Complex Adaptive Systems. "
25,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,3,"Murray Gell-Mann is a hero of mine - he was one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century - or any century. However while I agree with the basic ideas - sometimes you need to take a crude look at everything around you and not just focus on the details. He makes this point mostly through physics - with a basic, but poorly worded, description of quantum mechanics (circa 1994)I also enjoyed how the last section dealt with humanity and how we need to look at the big picture; pulling in people from many different disciplines and work together to find a solution (or solutions).However the writing wasn't quite up to snuff. Arguments and discussions were repeated and areas outside of physics were very high level gloss. "
26,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028300-glen-engel-cox,2,"I picked this up because I thought it was going to have some information about Ecuador (the Jaguar section) in it. It does--about one whole pages worth. The rest of the pages concern Gell-Mann's ideas on the inter-connectedness of things. Gell-Mann, for those of you who don't buy the Nobel prize-winning scientist collector cards, was the identifier of the Quark, that object that is smaller than what had previously been thought of as the smallest element (electrons are made up of a collection of quarks). This book is interesting but rough slogging at times as Gell-Mann tries to give you an instant understanding of the last ten years of modern physics. This should appeal to fans of Richard Feynman and Douglas Hofstadter, although the style isn't as smooth as either of them."
27,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42769150-sparowhawke,3,"Too long ago, when I was still a student, I was an admirer of Dr. Gell-Mann's work. Not too long ago, after reading his paper, ""The Origin and Evolution of Word Order,"" I was reminded that I had not yet read this book. I meant to do so when it first came out, but I was then going through a career change, so I put off reading the book. The paper brought about an intersection of careers that prompted me to remedy my neglect. Now, almost twenty years after its original publication, the book seems a little dated. Had I read it earlier, I doubtless would have rated it higher. Its descriptions of research, then at the frontiers of various fields and still in progress, left this reader wishing for a sequel."
28,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8364288-tom-bane,4,"I'd like to blow the trumpet for this book as it is not very well known, it's an awesome discussion of quantum theory for the intelligent layman, with good coverage of quantum decoherence. This book is not easy-peasy physics for dummies but it needs to be experienced as it is accessible and comes from a different perspective to other popular science books, by delving deeper and exploring the mystery that is quantum physics.Best read over the course of a couple of days with a good cup of coffee, as too much to take in all at once! and that is The Quark and the Jaguar's only weakness, is that in trying to embrace too much the book loses a little bit of focus in the process. "
29,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9655464-steven-allat,3,"Reading this has just reinforced within me the knowing that we will not ever truly 'science' the world of quantum mechanics . . . nor do we need to.While not being completely for the layman, even though the author asserts it to be more accessible than other texts on the subject, it really isn't. Even then, the important bits for me are the philosophical ones, because the math will never be achieved in the realm of how the micro works and relates to the macro.Still, I am glad to have digested this work so that I can move forward in my own work in writing about reconciling exactly how this thing we call life works. "
30,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52339370-georg-hohbach,4,"Deep and profound thoughts about the interconnection of simplicity and complexity by one of the leading phycisists. Written with passion and love for the subject: physics and systematic thinking to understand how simplicity serves as the premise of processes that generate complex, wonderful outcomes - like our marvelously structured universe, which we are part of to analyse this very question. Gell-Mann elegantly converges different fields into his framework, unifying these different aspects of reality in a systematic vision based on physics that contains the most fundamental laws in purely mathematical form. "
31,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8032118-phoebe,5,"After a raft of popular physics books made connections between quantum physics and eastern philosophy, it was becoming difficult for the lay-physicist to see anything else. This book came as a welcome relief from that particular quasi religious angle, while still adopting an ideological tone.I enjoy Gell-Mann's writing very much. He makes you feel very ""close"" to the subject, by not underrating his audience's ability for comprehension. Leaving room for inspiration, this book resonated for weeks after reading."
32,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366630-eal,4,"Excellent book. Covers a lot of interesting ground: complexity, chaos theory, quantum mechanics, string theory, thermodynamics, diversity, sustainability. I moved through the middle section about quantum physics more slowly than the other sections, which was strange because I like particle physics, so be aware if you've read Brian Greene books that the phys writing here is not *quite* as engaging. The rest of the book was, however, remarkably well-executed.Personal note: I'm glad that Gell-Mann's critiques of Caltech culture further assured me that my college choice is on solid ground."
33,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10692276-kai-pak,3,"An interesting read that broaches several complex topics with some splashes of brilliance and insight. It was perhaps a little too ambitious (even for a genius like Gell-Man) to try to describe so many disparate topics (quantum mechanics, particle physics, economics, linguistics, evolutionary biology, sociology, and more) within a single < 400 page book. As a result, the effort sometimes comes across as muddled and watered down--especially the end, where it meanders into social and ecological issues and the human structures meant to deal with them. "
34,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25687639-mark,3,"Readability 5. Rating 5. The subtitle “Adventures in the Simple and the Complex” doesn’t add much to an enigmatic title. Probably just what the publisher intended. The book rambled through Gell-Mann’s expertise as well as areas that were clearly more a discussion of his view of homo sapiens and the how they impact the world. Although this was interesting at times, he tended to range from the obscure to the opinionated without any particularly stunning insights. Overall, his personal philosophy seemed very thoughtful, but I guess I felt I needed more from the book."
35,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745489-joshua-smith,3,Never really finished it. Now that I'm like a scientist I want to re-read it. A quark is like a sub-sub-atomic particle (quark - proton/neutron - atom - molecule - organism/matter). It's a good book to help you realize that much of what you know/believe is based on the point at which you stopped looking deeper. Helpful if you're still deciding on whether or not issues like stem cell research are moral. 
36,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259137-mia,5,"Okay, so anybody's who's ever seen my LJ interest list knows I'm predisposed to like this book, ""chaos, order, simplicity, complexity"", plus a healthy dose of systems theory, quantum physics, an understanding for the need to not treat all subjects as reductive, as well as an awareness of the need to engage with the real world... The book is definitely not easy going for sections, but it nevr felt like a chore to read."
37,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4812756-jishnu-bhattacharya,3,"This is a good book, no doubt. Murray Gell-Mann knows what he is talking about, and it's always a pleasure to hear a noble laureate speak about his favorite topic. The parts about coarse graining were really illuminating. However, some parts did seem like a bit of a drag, maybe because I have read Dawkins and others speaking about the same things over and over again.Nonetheless, if you're a popular science enthusiast, you should read this."
38,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2458054-frank,3,"The quality here is uneven. MGM isn't an experienced writer and he may be trying to cover too much ground. I valued most of all the early chapters, with their thought provoking discussion of complexity and randomness. The final section, on policy issues related to conservation is obviously out of place."

42,0805072535,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7037785-david,5,"A profound book. Gell-Mann writes simple sentences that are like compressed zip files, you read a line or two then you sit back and let what you have read unfold. A book like this can take months to read, not recommended for light readers."
