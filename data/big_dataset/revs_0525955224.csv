The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: If we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible.
Who knew a book about numbers could be so entertaining? Weaponized Lies is written for the average person, those of us who aren't statisticians or scientists. It introduces fundamental critical thinking skills that will assist the reader in making logical decisions and analyzing claims made in the news. The spread of misinformation is not a new problem, but the internet has made it more pervasive. Some people and publications are more likely to be right than others, but no one is infallible. Bad information can be spread by people with an agenda or people who don't know any better. Regardless of motive, it's our job to think critically about information before we spread it or form opinions. By knowing what questions to ask, we can better assess the validity of claims. Levitin reminds us to be critical of information that confirms our biases too. I liked his method of asking the reader to question a previous statement in the book. It reminded me to remain alert and critical, even of Levitin's claims.
Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without.
This edition is a repackaging of A Field Guide to Lies (pub. 9/6/16). The biggest (only?) difference is the introduction. In the updated introduction, Levitin argues that euphemisms, such as ""fake news"" or ""extreme views,"" are doing a disservice to us all. It makes falsehoods sound less insidious than they are. False statements should be called what they actually are--lies.This book is divided into three sections:
EVALUATING NUMBERS

Biases, inaccuracies, and honest mistakes can enter at any stage. Part of evaluating claims includes asking the questions “Can we really know that?” and “How do they know that?”
Numbers seem so objective and definitive, but they shouldn't be taken at face value. Statistics and infographics can be manipulated to lead you to a conclusion that doesn't hold up upon closer look. Sometimes our basic knowledge of the world can weed out the bad information immediately, but other times the deception is more obscured. We should always question how the numbers were collected and interpreted. Visual representations of statistics make a powerful impact and most people only give them a passing glance. Levitin explains the methods used to deceive with infographics. He uses real-world examples to reinforce the points. One example shown is the misleading chart shown at the Planned Parenthood hearing in 2015.What is the likelihood of something occurring or being true? Probability gives us a much broader view than anecdotes and helps us make better decisions. Make sure you understand the ""Probabilities"" chapter, especially Bayesian probability, because it comes up in other chapters!  I was especially interested in probability in the medical industry, because understanding how probability works can make you a more empowered patient. If you get a positive result on a mammogram, what is the actual chance of having breast cancer? Under 10%, because the disease is relatively rare and the test is not perfect. There are also times when doctors have recommended unnecessary, intrusive operations based on faulty understanding of probability.
EVALUATING WORDS
This section includes tools to evaluate the information we encounter every day. We depend on experts to provide information, but does everything they say hold the same weight? No! For example, just because someone is world-renowned neurosurgeon* doesn't make them an expert in other fields, even other medical fields. Sometimes experts engage in speculation like the rest of us and it's important to be able to differentiate between opinions and evidenced-based claims. Levitin also lists the telltale signs of bias or deception. He explains different techniques used to deceive people, such as burying fallacious arguments in a cluster of facts. Does a website's claims to reveal ""truth"" actually indicate the opposite? Before we blindly accept a claim, we should also ask if there are any alternative explanations that weren't considered or revealed.
EVALUATING THE WORLD
The inner workings of the scientific community are a mystery to many and charlatans take advantage of this. In this section, Levitin explains the scientific method and the rigorous process through which scientists come to a consensus. He addresses the myths about science: (1) scientists never disagree and (2) a single experiment tells us all we need to know. He also explains common logical fallacies, so that we can better evaluate scientific claims. The autism/vaccines controversy is used to illustrate four logical fallacies in action.The information presented in this book is not just helpful for evaluating the news. Bayesian thinking can help with a legal defense, making an important medical decision, or even evaluating salesperson's claims. The last chapter includes four case studies that apply the previous lessons in critical thinking to the real world. My favorite of the four was Levitin's personal story about his dog's illness. He and his wife were able to logically think through every option and choose the path that was best for their dog. They were able to be a peace knowing they had done everything they could for their dog, while also causing the least harm.
There are not two sides to a story when one side is a lie. .... Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence, and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinion. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them.
My only complaint is the ""Numbers"" chapter felt more fleshed out than the ""Words"" and ""World"" chapters. The last two sections went so fast and I was so disappointed when the content ended 2/3s of the way through. I wasn't ready for it to end yet! Maybe that's more of a compliment than a complaint! The remainder of the pages are filled with a glossary, supporting documentation, and an index.
We’re far better off knowing a moderate number of things with certainty than a large number of things that might not be so.
Weaponized Lies is about understanding the limits of our knowledge and not being ashamed to admit that we don't know everything. This book encourages people to think scientifically and suppress the temptation to automatically discount dissenting evidence. It's easy to submit to lazy thinking when we're bombarded with so much information and we're so busy with our everyday lives. None of us are logically perfect human beings, so it's important to be aware of our flaws.  This book is an excellent refresher course in thinking critically. It's helped me better articulate why I find some information manipulative or misleading. The best part of the book is that it gave me an upper hand in an ongoing argument with my husband (he was essentially ""truncating the y-axis"" to make a misleading point). Thanks, Daniel Levitin! ;D
NOTES:
* I used a neurosurgeon as an example because of Ben Carson's recent claims about memory: Washington Post, Wired.* I read this book around the same time I watched Denial, a movie about a woman who was sued by a Holocaust denier for libel (a real-life case: Irving v Penguin Books). In the movie, the woman is frustrated with the defense's refusal to allow witness testimony and the lawyer's heartless questions. The defense maintains that they need to prove the case more objectively if they're going to win in a definitive way. Richard Rampton:""They're a strange thing, consciences. Trouble is, what feels best isn't necessarily what works best.""* Purple America Has All But Disappeared: This article on FiveThirtyEight terrified me more than anything else I've read recently: ""In an increasing number of communities .... an entire generation of youth will grow up without much exposure to alternative political points of view. If you think our political climate is toxic now, think for a moment about how nasty politics could be 20 or 30 years from now.""* ""The longer I live, the more I read, the more patiently I think, and the more anxiously I inquire, the less I seem to know...Do justly. Love mercy. Walk humbly. This is enough.” - John Adams*Popular comic about the science news cycle.*Important concepts to remember: belief perseverance (""once we form a belief or accept a claim, it's very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary"") & perception of risk (""overestimating the relative risks of things that receive media attention"") __________________I received this book for free from Netgalley and PENGUIN GROUP Dutton.

1,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"Oh, boy, I wish every one of my fellow citizens had the information shared in this book as part of their reading regime. On one hand, it would make it much harder to convince people with statistics. On the other hand, it would be much harder to convince people with statistics. Come to think of it, I think nowadays most people mistrust statistics, unless the statistics back up their own opinion. How many times I received end-of-quarter reports from some mutual fund company showing showing growth and profits exceeding other companies’ but their graphs do not have the axes on their bar charts or line graphs labelled. Even one so discrepant in the moneymaking arts as I know this for a sham report.Levitin does a couple of things in this book: he describes common ways to use statistics to disguise facts. He points out common errors the best-intentioned of us make (like doctors determining probabilities in positive cancer screens) and leads us to the way to find answers. He demystifies “expert testimony” by pointing out that expertise is typically narrow.Donald Trump features in this book, both quoted directly and by implication:  “Truth is the default position and we assume others are being truthful with us. An old joke goes, “How do you know that some is lying to you? Because they begin with the phrase to be perfectly honest. Honest people do not need to preface their remarks this way.” In the last third of the book, Levitin runs through how to think straight: deduction and induction, logical fallacies, framing risk, and belief perseverance, ending with a separate chapter on Bayesian probability. Finally, he gives four case studies to see if you managed to understand what he’d been telling you all along. He ends with a physicist’s explanation of new ideas and what we really don’t know for sure.Levitin is very good. The material in his book parallels an earlier book I’d reviewed, Psy-Q by Ben Ambridge, which takes a fun look at the ways we can deceive or stun our friends. And truthfully (?!), I found Ambridge's explanation of Bayesian probabilities a little more understandable and applicable. But if you are like me, you need to review those proofs again and again every which way before you can explain it yourself. Psy-Q is a Penguin Paperback Original.Both these books would be very useful for high school or college students or educators. These experts (now I wonder if I can use that term ever again) try to make it easy for us whose expertise lies elsewhere. It seems that most Americans may have learned only half of what they needed to from this book, so learning what we didn’t the first time around will be useful for the rest of our lives.On my blog is a short video of Levitin explaining logical fallacy which will give you some idea of the audience to whom he is speaking."
2,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"If someone told me I would read a book about numbers and enjoy it as much as a good novel, I suspect I would snort with laughter. Not that I'm number phobic or a math hater, but reading about numbers seems like an awfully dull way to spend precious reading time. But Trish's review of A field Guide to Lies piqued my interest, so I decided to give it a try. And, in fairness, the title doesn't suggest that this is mostly a book about numbers. But it didn't make for dull reading. In a very matter of fact manner -- almost conversational -- Daniel Levitin walked me through different ways numbers and various forms of logic can be presented to look like facts for the purpose of manipulating opinions. His focus wasn't just on numbers, but the first half was very much focused on numbers while the second half was focused on word use and logical reasoning. It wasn't all news to me, but it was a good crisp survey and reminder. A Field Guide to Lies is definitely a good read for anyone who wants to approach news and information with a heavy dose of informed scepticism. In fact, it should really be required reading for all high school students -- not to mention all supporters of a particularly troublesome candidate in the upcoming election. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."
3,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions - critical skills that we need today since we're blasted with information in a society based on conspicuous consumption. Everyone wants our support or to sell us something & many are skilled at leveraging our inherent flaws in reasoning to this end. Reading this should be a prerequisite for posting on Facebook.The flaws inherent in our reasoning are manifold. We're a story-loving species & try to find patterns in everything. Both of these are methods for simplifying the reasoning process by giving us hooks on which to hang all the data. We tend toward beliefs, often snap judgements based on previous experience. Once we believe in something, it is much harder to shake our thinking process into a different pattern. A newspaper headline can be a complete lie & shown so in the story that follows, but people remember the lie.The book is broken into 3 sections. Each teaches methods for evaluating data & then contains real world examples, many taken from the current press.Evaluating Numbers: starts off with a quote attributed to Mark Twain It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.- Plausibility: There are lies, damn lies, & statistics, so the latter are a conundrum today. We're aware they can be used to lie convincingly, but they look so good to us. What we fail to consider is how they are figured & he gives some great examples of common errors in them, probability, & percentages.- Fun With Averages: Summary statistics (the mean, median, & mode) are all useful IF they are used correctly. They can be downright deceiving if used incorrectly, though. The mean (what we usually think of as the 'average') is very sensitive to outliers while the median & mode are far less so. Again, he does a great job of putting this into real world examples of when each should be used, when avoided, & what we should watch for.- Axis Shenanigans: Graphs are another great way to condense information in a way that makes more sense, but they can also easily be misleading by not labeling or creatively labeling the axes.- Hijinks With How Numbers Are Reported: This section builds on the preceding sections to show how the underlying numbers can be manipulated & why it is often profitable to do so. He also mentions the fallacy of correlation versus causation, a very common trap. - How Numbers Are Collected:""Just because there’s a number on it, it doesn’t mean that the number was arrived at properly."" Wow. Again, great examples.- Probabilities allow us to quantify future events and are an important aid to rational decision making. Without them, we can become seduced by anecdotes and stories. While Levitin does a great job of simplifying it, there are some terms that I needed to get very comfortable with. This is the main section where the text really helps since he gets into Fourfold tables which help make sense of the actual odds. This is not always intuitive. In fact, our brains are wired to see them incorrectly much of the time. The rest of the book refers back to this section regularly, so it's important to understand it.Classic probability is what we typically think of, but it is based on symmetry & equal likelihood such in the case of a coin toss. All the possibilities are known & discreet, but this is often not the case in real world problems such as how well a drug works, AKA Frequentist Probability. There is also Subjective Probability, such as when someone expresses an opinion on the likelihood of a future event. To confuse the issue further, we often combine them. We also need to consider conditional probability when an event is informed by another event (e.g., most car accidents happen during rush hour) & remember that these do not work backward (Just because it is rush hour does not mean you are likely be in an accident if another condition changes, such as not driving.) but we often forget the conditions & think that way.Evaluating Words: Language is slippery & defines how we think about things. Half truths are often the worst lies.- How Do We Know? We rely on experts, certifications, licenses, encyclopedias, and textbooks. AKA, secondhand knowledge, so we need to evaluate the the source & the claims. Who is the source & how likely is it that they're right? Experts can be wrong, they're just less likely to be IN THEIR AREA OF EXPERTISE (next section) than a random person. If the claim is a good one, we should be able to evaluate the evidence & it should be well documented. The content of footnotes are especially important & should be fully explored.- Identifying Expertise: People are generally only experts in a narrow field, especially today when everything is so complicated. My doctor's opinion on what ails my car shouldn't weigh as heavily as my mechanic's, but we're often swayed by degrees or popularity. Levitin outlines some great ways to identify snow jobs including looking at the URL domain & other handy tips for using the Internet wisely & avoiding common terminology pitfalls.- Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanations: This goes back to our beliefs & love of stories. When we're given a likely story, it's often difficult to think of another, but the preceding sections have given us great tools for spotting inaccurate statistics/probabilities, missing factors such as a control group, &/or cherry-picked data.-CounterKnowledge...is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people have begun to believe. Generally conspiracy theories & pseudoscience. They often rely on open questions & anomalies which are then whipped into a likely story.“If you thought that science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part.” - Richard Feynman""The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.” – Bertrand RussellEvaluating the World: deals with critical thinking overall & there is some repetition of previous material, but here he pulls all the skills he's outlined together & shows them in a variety of situations.How Science Works: He explains deduction & induction in scientific reasoning, where & how each should be used. Again, there are several excellent real-world examples & common pitfalls outlined, such as the reversal of logical statements.Logical Fallacies: Correlation confused with causation comes up again along with common framing & prior belief issues.Knowing What You Don't Know“There are things we know, things we are aware that we do not know, and some things we aren’t even aware that we don’t know.” There’s a fourth possibility, of course—things we know that we aren’t aware we know. It seems a bit confusing at first read, but read it over a bit & it makes perfect sense. Evaluating our own knowledge is really important & sometimes that means digging back into the foundations of that knowledge & laying out the problem properly. He does a great job of sorting it all out.Bayesian Thinking in Science & Court: Unlikely claims require more proof than likely ones, but this relies on understanding probability properly & that's something our court system often gets wrong. It's so well known that it is called The Prosecutor's Fallacy.Four Case Studies are great examples of weighing probabilities in real world situations. In the first, he decided on how to handle cancer in his dog. This book is worth reading for this one example alone.There is a great conclusion to sum it up. In the print version, there is also an appendix that outlines & applies Baye's Rule, & a glossary. While this is very well read & great as an audio book for the most part, I'd suggest getting a text copy since there are some tables and logic equations that were helpful to look at. I highly recommend this to everyone. If my kids were still in the house, I'd make it required reading & I'd test them on it. We're deluged with information constantly. This is a wonderful book on how to evaluate & make sense out of the flood."
4,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"One of the most dangerous bits of confusion out there is the idea that ""we live longer"". I was very happy that Levitin addresses this early on (p.20), explaining that AVERAGE life expectancy is up a lot mainly because children don't die, not because there used to be no old people. 4* at that point. :-)So why 1* for the book? Because on p.175, he makes an argument based on the statement that ""people are living longer."" For crying out loud, did he not read his own @#$%^& book?!There's a bigger population of old people in America. That's true, but not because we all live to 100 now. It's because: 1. Fewer kids die (see above) and 2. People have fewer kids (so as a % more of the populace is old) and 3. The total population is bigger. Life expectancy at age 80 has barely changed (something you can verify even on the commercial website Levitin uses as a reference). I get it that it's hard to think in terms of averages and populations. Unfortunately what this shambolic example illustrates is the utter hopelessness of Levitin's central premise, i.e. trying to teach the entire population to think critically/scientifically/statistically. And anyway, that premise is just not fair. There are gatekeepers of information, like professional writers, book reviewers, editors and such who do NEED to know this stuff if they're going to talk about it; it's their responsibility. It matters. Oy.Better books for assorted audiences:

5,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"A good mix of Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't and Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, with original ideas thrown in as well.It makes me sad to think that people actually need to be told some of the information in this book, like “Check the y-axis on any chart presented by a politician”, or that snopes.com and Consumer Reports are good places to check the veracity of claims. However, it seems like people need to be told (again), so I'm glad that somebody's doing the telling. Still, will the happy time ever come where grown-ups don't need to be told this, like they don't need to be told not to stick their finger in an electrical outlet?To be fair, there were moments when I needed to read things two or three times, moving my lips, and not (I flatter myself) because I am dumber than the average clam, but because my whiskey-addled brain shot predictably to the “intuitive” – but wrong – answer. Example: a con artist has three cards. One is red on both sides, one is white on both sides, the third is red on one side and white on the other. He shows you the card that is red on both sides. Then he shows you one side of a card – it is white. Is it an even-money bet that the other side is red? It seemed like it was to me, even though I knew this is a book largely about deceptive practices. So I was happy to be schooled on my (embarrassingly obvious in retrospect) mistake, which was not considering that the con artist could be showing me either of two sides of the white card, meaning the chance of the other side being red is one in three, not one in two.Similarly, the author's, and Nate Silver's, best efforts notwithstanding, I'm having a hard time getting my mind around Bayesian analysis. As the author puts it (Kindle location 1117), Bayesian tools “… are so powerful, it's surprising they're not taught to us in high school.” I'm still super cheesed-off that we spent all that time learning trigonometry but I didn't find out about Bayesian analysis until my dotage. My understanding was also obstructed by the lack, in my electronic galley copy, of graphic aid in the form of the 2x2 Bayesian squares to accompany the author's examples. (Instead, my copy just had clumps of numbers in gaps in the text. The intended graphic could be reconstructed with a pencil and paper, using clues from the number clumps and the narrative, if you move your lips slowly enough.) I think and hope the publisher will clean this up for the commercial release of the book. Also, I hope someone will check the arithmetic on the Bayesian squares, for example, the one at location 1111, but also squares closer to the end of the book, because I think some of the figures are in error and don't add up – perhaps a typographic error.BTW, what's the difference between an ebook and an “enhanced” ebook, besides the $2 price that is in evidence at the publisher's web page. Is an enhanced ebook like the “premium” version of smartphone apps, meaning, one where all the features actually work correctly, more or less?Thanks to those nice people at Penguin Random House and Netgalley for a free electronic copy of this book."

There’s the missed potential to have more fun with this but it instead, seriously and perhaps appropriately given the nature of the book, resorts to cold hard logical truths and talks of bimodal distributions and Bayesian probability.Still, 3 out of 4 dentists agree that this is better than 50% of the books out there.

The style is simple and the tone is sometimes colloquial. From what I understood by looking at previous reviews, some people found this book eye-opening, others felt that we should already know how to go about misinformation and counterknowledge and it seems like they didn't get much value out of it. To me, even people who are ""questioners"" or work in science and research can find lots of value into this book, as I did (and pass it to others that might benefit from this read even more!). How did the Field guide change me? It made me more inquisitive and also made me feel truly responsible for the outcome of the decisions I made according to the information I have handy."

It sits squarely in the area of books that are not good enough to be praised, but not bad enough to be ridiculed either.The title was what drew me to the book, because the sheer amount of content that I consume in an average day is higher than average, making the chances that I am exposed to false claims also higher than most people. To separate the wheat from the chaff, quickly and efficiently and to use fancy terms to beat the crap out of people who use bad logic(I'm referring to all those idiots who've forwarded a whatsapp message without checking the facts), I thought this book would be a handy supplement.Unfortunately the book does not live up to it's claims. The fundamental problem with writing a book like this is that it's a fine line to walk. In this case, the author was not able to toe that line well enough. A book like this needs to either be entertaining enough for the average person to read, or enlightening enough for the average scientist or technical reader to relish. This book does neither of those things, since the writing style is mostly dry and the analyses are mundane. It's nothing that would impress a technical reader, and an average person would get bored and give up at the ten percent mark.That being said, I did learn some new things from the book, and it's not a complete disaster, but it doesn't live up to the title of being a field guide to lies.The same book if written by a more experienced author, might be a lot more engaging.Summary: Don't read it."

Some in-text sourcing might help resolve this issue... now that I think about it, I think Levitin could benefit from a good newswriting class himself.Meh, I lack the energy to detail the ways I think this could be better. For me, it was not a very valuable read. But it's concerning to think there may be a lot of people who don't know or trust these things. So perhaps it is a valuable book for a different audience."

This book is a good introduction into critical reading and judging the information presented to you. It’s not the most in-depth book, and I have to say that I didn’t really learn too much from it, yet it’s a wonderful concise summary of the most important things to consider.Looking critically at the world around us is a skill I would wish for everybody and i think many people would benefit greatly from the stepping stone this book presents.

As a skill set, it is absolutely essential, especially nowadays. When I went to library school, I was dumbfounded that people don't recognize when information is unreliably sourced, and gobsmacked that they will trust obviously biased sources over others. This hasn't changed at all. Sometimes Levitin can't conceal his disgust with certain ""lying weasels"" (e.g., the vaccines-cause-autism wackos), but I found myself carrying much more outrage than Levitin communicates. I think maybe he feared a lawsuit.We all need to know to distrust glib statistics, fudged information, and outright lies. Ask your librarian.

If you have taken a stats class, I highly recommend  Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide. It has more of a focus on scientific studies, but it applies to everyday life as well.

27,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15798988-gary,4,"This is the kind of book that should be distributed to high school juniors and seniors, and upon which tests should be composed which would determine whether or not students were to be issued diplomas. Maybe not this particular text. Levitin is writing for a broader market and more general audience than the average or below average high schooler whose mental powers need some sort of hammering into shape. But if not this one then one very similar.As for adults, Levitin's target audience, all I can say is that if the majority of lessons in this book aren't ones that they've already absorbed, then reading this book alone might not be enough to penetrate. It's remedial, but not so remedial that it can trick out an old dog. I'm increasingly finding a cold comfort in the words of the dearly departed George Carlin who said, My point being, it might be too late for a lot of 'em. If you consider for a moment (using some of the mathematical probability ideas expressed in this book, or just some simple math) the lower half of that bottom half, then look around at the world in which we find ourselves, George's axiom becomes pretty clear. We live in an age of unprecedented access to information. A vast amount of the knowledge of the human race is at our very fingertips. Yet, even with access to the World Library, tens of millions of Americans are unable to make a simple binary decision without being influenced by the most shallow and obvious lies. Now, we could argue that that is due to an equally unprecedented amount of disinformation to go along with it, and while that's true, I think it ignores the basic problem. Even with access to knowledge, there is an unimaginably large number of people unwilling or unable to understand basic facts. They aren't just Luddites who reject progress; they reject any value of truth itself. Think of the lower half of Carlin's bottom half--the people upon whom that ""average"" person thinks, ""Wow, what a dummy..."" and reflect that such a person represents the top edge of the bottom 25% percent of the population. That's well over 75,000,000 people in this country alone, the nominal democratic leader of the Western world.With that in mind, I'm not so confident that the idealistic basis of this book can actually happen. The liars are in business for good, and they are thriving. What's worse is that at this point, their audience is effectively insane. People who believe in chemtrails and that we faked the moon landing are almost quaintly idiosyncratic now. There's a huge swath of the population who cannot entertain reality even when confronted with it in favor of a fantasy construct in which it is truly they who are the smart ones. Oh, sure, they don't read books, or understand the math, or know anything about art, or history, or SAT vocabulary words, or science, or engineering, or how to compose a grammatical sentence, or cook without a microwave, but really THEY are the intelligent ones. Because all those things are for the smarty-pants, who are really dumb. Being smart isn't about knowing things, or knowing how to do things, or what things are, or how they work. There's a core center of instinctive intelligence that is much, much more importanter... importantly? importantism? Whatevah. You know whaddImean. Words are for those smarty-pants anyway.How is a book that relates the basic workings of statistics going to compete with that mindset? These people would take their cues from The Real Housewives of Narnia before factoring the probability of life saving medical procedures to be performed on their relatives.If we were to break up the population into thirds rather than halves as does Saint George, then I suppose it's possible that a book like this one might be able to help some of the folks in that middle third... maybe the middle third of that middle third. Much to either side of that and you start running into people for whom it is a repetition of the stats class they took as an AP course in high school on one side and the people who think the layaway program at TJ Maxx is a really good deal on the other.Still, it might be a good idea to start walking around with a few copies of this book under your arm to hand out to people who confront you with the latest round of, say, Russian-Collusion-with-the-White-House-by-way-of-Fox-News Hillary Clinton propaganda at the counter of your local diner while you're just minding your own business trying to eat a fucking tuna melt. (That's a true story, BTW.) Just slip a copy of this book across the counter towards them and see if they cringe away, hissing like Gollum. ""Bookses! It readses bookses!

I really enjoyed the first third of the book, but, then it started to run out of steam for me merely because I took a statistics class just a few years ago and have read other articles/books on critical thinking in the last few years. If it's been more than a few years since you've done either, than this will probably be a really enjoyable read. As it was, I still liked the book quite a bit. "
30,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20768655-maggie-gordon,4,"I am an academic by trade. Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone. This book is a breath of fresh air in lungs filled with social media, news and secondary information with no real context."
32,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
33,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."
34,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43250467-tim-shortt,2,"The case studies at the end most soured me on this book, left me wondering what I was meant to take from it. Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV? Apparently I'm supposed to run four-fold probability charts to arrive at the truth."

Unfortunately, this book was not that. It's incredibly dry and none of the examples are particularly engaging. If you've taken a college statistics class, there's nothing new here. If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
36,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
37,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
39,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."

A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth.

The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

62,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
63,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."

Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV?

What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume.

67,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "
68,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"As if I need any more book suggestions, I have a couple of feeds I've voluntarily signed up for and this popped up on one of them some time ago and I've just now gotten around to reading it. I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
69,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."

A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."

Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

92,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
93,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."

Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV?

97,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
99,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."

A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."

The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

105,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19710738-h-ctor-iv-n-patricio-moreno,4,"This book gives you clear advise about how to avoid being fooled by incompetents and liars. The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
123,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work.

But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians?

Unfortunately, this book was not that. It's incredibly dry and none of the examples are particularly engaging. If you've taken a college statistics class, there's nothing new here. If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
126,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
127,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
129,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."
131,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,4,"An extraordinarily useful and highly readable book that romps through the kind of logical processes (some of them mathematical, though nothing too testing) that we should go through when evaluating our information sources. A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."

Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone. This book is a breath of fresh air in lungs filled with social media, news and secondary information with no real context."

Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
153,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."
154,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43250467-tim-shortt,2,"The case studies at the end most soured me on this book, left me wondering what I was meant to take from it. Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV? Apparently I'm supposed to run four-fold probability charts to arrive at the truth."

Unfortunately, this book was not that. It's incredibly dry and none of the examples are particularly engaging. If you've taken a college statistics class, there's nothing new here. If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
156,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
157,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
159,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."
161,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,4,"An extraordinarily useful and highly readable book that romps through the kind of logical processes (some of them mathematical, though nothing too testing) that we should go through when evaluating our information sources. A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."
162,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50969968-alfie-yee,2,"This by all accounts was a tough read. Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."

Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource. "

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone. This book is a breath of fresh air in lungs filled with social media, news and secondary information with no real context."
182,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
183,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."
184,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43250467-tim-shortt,2,"The case studies at the end most soured me on this book, left me wondering what I was meant to take from it. Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV? Apparently I'm supposed to run four-fold probability charts to arrive at the truth."
185,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31879014-minal,2,"Numbers and statistics are incredibly easy to manipulate. They're not the source of truth we often believe they are, and I would have loved to read something that truly showcased the many times we've been misled by poorly conducted surveys and duplicitous graphs. Unfortunately, this book was not that. It's incredibly dry and none of the examples are particularly engaging. If you've taken a college statistics class, there's nothing new here. If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
186,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
187,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
189,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."

A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."

Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

211,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46730728-stuart,5,"I love it when I come across well rounded and informative non-fiction as I get the opportunity to talk about it non-stop. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone. This book is a breath of fresh air in lungs filled with social media, news and secondary information with no real context."

Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
213,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."
214,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43250467-tim-shortt,2,"The case studies at the end most soured me on this book, left me wondering what I was meant to take from it. Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV? Apparently I'm supposed to run four-fold probability charts to arrive at the truth."

If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
216,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
217,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
219,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though.

The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."
222,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50969968-alfie-yee,2,"This by all accounts was a tough read. Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."
223,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2948709-nico,4,"The first part (evaluating numbers) of this book is the one I enjoyed the most. Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

242,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
243,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work. This is a great chapter."
244,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43250467-tim-shortt,2,"The case studies at the end most soured me on this book, left me wondering what I was meant to take from it. Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV? Apparently I'm supposed to run four-fold probability charts to arrive at the truth."

If not, I can't imagine this would be an enjoyable read. "
246,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume. I'd love to see this book as part of a high school curriculum - the primer on Bayesian thinking is something everyone should understand.
247,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
249,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"

The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."

A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."

Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth.

The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "

The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "

Methods and I are good friends at this point as I have spent ten years learning how to construct and evaluate arguments and data. I recognise this is not an accurate reflection of most people's lives. However, critical thinking and the ability to understand and parse statistics is a required skill for being a good citizen in today's world, and for living an optimum life. Unfortunately, these skills are undervalued, leading to a lot of misinformation being propagated and bad choices being made. Take, for example, the recent study about birth control and depression. The Guardian article on this and its related spinoffs were read and discussed by hundreds of thousands of people, yet the journalist who was reporting on the study fundamentally misunderstood the methods used in the research, and therefore presented an incredibly inaccurate reflection of the results. There was no discussion of the sampling, intervening variables, or even generalisability. Additionally, the numbers discussed in the article were stripped of the numerical context that gave them meaning. In the end, there was panic and outrage over results that were overstated at best and completely misstated at worst. But if The Guardian, a well respected news source, doesn't always get its facts right, who can you trust?This is where Danual Levitin comes in. A Field Guide to Lies is a book that teaches people how to think critically and determine what out of the wash of information of modern life is worth believing. He carefully walks through common logical pitfalls, and gives people a road map for how to accurately judge various claims without needing to enroll in ten years of post secondary education. Of particular importance is his conversation about statistics and numerical literary. He breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is understandable and easy to use. From abduction to scatter plots, A Field Guide to Lies demystifies information and encourages people to take an active roll in being critical about what we are told. From the end of the book: ""Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks not takes just seconds. We've saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our question. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification... Counterknowledge and misinformation can be costly, in terms of lives and happiness, and in terms of the time spent trying to undo things that didn't go the way we thought they would. True knowledge simplifies our lives, helping us to make choices that increase our happiness and save time."" If you have ever felt like you needed more instruction on judging the quality of information, or you need ideas for how to talk about complex concepts without using too many academic words, this book is an invaluable resource.

A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics is exactly what it says on the tin. Daniel Levitin has spent his career learning about the mind; social/economic sciences and writing books about how to understand the modern world we live in today. Along the way he has crafted an entertaining, digestible and objective writing style that gives the reader an unbiased view of his content while spending time and effort on informing the reader about some hidden truths.Daniel Levitin is clear, concise and open about his aims with A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics. The first line sums up the idea behind the book nicely. (Quote, page ix)""This is a book about how to spot problems with the facts you encounter, problems that may lead you to draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes the people giving you the facts are hoping you'll draw the wrong conclusion; sometimes they don't know the difference themselves.""DL is focused, driven and animated, his main focus with the content is evaluation, plausibility and critical thinking. Taking the reader the extra mile past common sense and explaining how to really listen to you inner red flag that is telling you that something is not right. A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics takes us through the perplexing gauntlet of numbers, words and how they can skew our image of the world around us.Using succinct arguments and backing them up with plenty of evidence, DL works his way through the many different techniques and pitfalls that people can use to warp information in their favour. From averages, extrapolation; the numerous fallacies and biases, diagrams, variables and so much more. Levitin gives us a helping hand to work our way through the information and find out what is true and what is not. I am so glad I read this book, it is important now more than ever (in this high speed information age) that we slow down and really think about the information we are being fed day in and day out.I recommend A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics to all readers. Here we get a straightforward, clear cut path through the mess of language and numbers that make up modern media. This book will only a few hours out of your life, but it will give you so much more in return. There are so many great quotes in this book, I am concerned about including too many as I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. DL is full of pithy insights that I jotted down throughout my time reading this book, from 'Science and Life are not static' (p155) to 'we are the story telling species' (p157).Overall, I have given A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics 5/5 because I learned so much, I enjoyed myself while I did so and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

272,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72916632-bobi,2,"This book joins a growing list of 'skeptic' sites/books/authors and as such is deeply skewed to orthodox anti-conspiratorial explanations. Being an academic, the author is beholden to the system that puts bread on his table. He skips from topic to topic too quickly and doesn't delve into enough details to put conspiracy theories to bed - he simply dismisses them with some form of simplistic analysis. A good example would be his too-brief treatment of 911 is which he places great weight on so-called experts - experts that only seemed to cast doubt on whether the fuel available could raise the temperature of steel enough and then asks us to consider all the extra fuel pre-existing in the building (paper, carpets, etc). He forgot that oxygen was the limiting factor, not the fuel. Thus he dismisses the supposedly unlikely (but popular) explanation of controlled demolition. He rejects the unlikely possibility of it being undertaken by The government without considering that it could be ANOTHER governments or other organizations with sophisticated (enough) resources. Inexplicably he also completely ignores building 7!!! Maybe he'll get to it later in the book, if i can last that long. In the meantime, several towers have burned quite nicely without falling down! His treatment of climate deniers and medicine is similarly skewed toward orthodoxy, with no probing of the the herd effect within his sacred ivory tower in supporting answers preferred by (political) funding agencies. Thus was Galileo found guilty, and while he does acknowledge such possibilities, he steers clear of deep analysis. Being an expert of course, he can and does outline many genuine statistical problems and sleights of hand that we should indeed become more aware of and for this he deserves praise. But the gullible will fall for such expertise and fail to think critically about which side he might be on.  "
273,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"I removed 1 star, only because I don't think the author offers any kind of framework for critical thinking in the Information Age such that you could use this as a guide. In this regard, the book is less a field guide and more a list of top tricks that people employ to wrongly present an argument.The book is quite a good read, particularly if you are not already very knowledgable about the topic. He goes through common mathematical concepts that are often manipulated to make one believe something other than the truth, lies related to the way data is displayed.I did love the chapter on Identifying Expertise. This chapter offers many good resources to double check information on the internet. I had no idea how easy it was to pull up common links or sites like Politifact.com and how they work.

Before then it just felt like a survey course for aspiring researchers given a popular gloss. Didn't see how many of its lessons might help me deal with a world where auditors are in on the game (Enron), or bond ratings agencies aren't doing the job (2008), or companies are fudging the data through software (VW), a world where CNN fills its schedule with competing insiders or a generation's most trusted news source is comedy shows. But then those case studies. To critically determine if a magician is pulling an actual magic trick I need to interview a couple doctors and four magicians? How do the evidence standards of PHDs working the world's most expensive science project relate to how we should determine if people are shitting us on the Internet or on TV?

276,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,Levitin's premise is simple: the world today offers an abundance of information. What used to take hours or days to dig up using traditional research now takes moments. We need to reinvest a bit of that time saved into thinking critically about the information we consume.

277,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,4,"Introduction: Thinking, Criticallyp.xi – What has happened to our language? The Oxford Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2016 was post-truth, which they define as an adjective “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” It was selected because its usage skyrocketed during that year. I believe we need to get back to using plain old “truth” again – and fast. And we need to reject the idea that truth doesn’t exist anymore. We are all being more than a bit too careful in how we refer to falsehoods. Perhaps in an effort to avoid personal confrontations, an effort to “just get along,” we have started to use euphemisms to refer to things that are just plain whack-a-do crazy. p.xiv – Other euphemisms for lies are counter-knowledge, half-truths, extreme views, alt truth, conspiracy theories, and, the more recent appellation, “fake news.” p.xiv – There are not tow sides to a story when one side is a lie. Journalists – and the rest of us – must stop giving equal time to things that don’t have a fact-based opposing side. Two sides to a story exist when evidence exists on both sides of a position. Then, reasonable people may disagree about how to weigh that evidence and what conclusion to form from it. Everyone, of course, is entitled to their own opinions. But they are not entitled to their own facts. Lies are an absence of facts and, in many cases, a direct contradiction of them. Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of will full irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Maybe journalists don’t want to call “fake news” what it is, a lie, because they don’t wasn’t to offend the liars. But I say offend them! Call them on the carpet. p.xv – Perhaps a better formulation is: What has been happening to our educational systems and institutions in the run-up to this post-truth era? The number of books students read on average declines steadily every single year after second grade. Already fifteen years ago, the U.S. Department of Education found that more than one in five adult Americans were not even able to locate information in text or “make low-level inferences using printed materials.” We have apparently failed to teach our children what constitutes evidence and how to evaluate it. This is worthy of our outrage. p.xvi – Facebook is making an effort to live up to its social responsibility as a source of information by “making it easier for its 1.8 billion members to report fake news.” In other words, to call a lie a lie. Perhaps other social media sites will take an increasingly curatorial role in the future. At the very least, we can hope that their role in weaponizing lies will decrease.p.xviii – There is no “news” in fake news. Belief in lies can be harmless, such as belief in Santa Clause or that these new jeans make me look thin. What weaponizes the lies is not the media nor Facebook. The danger is in the intensity of that belief – the unquestioning overconfidence that it is true. Critical thinking trains us to take a step back, to evaluate facts and form evidence-based conclusion. What got Welch into a situation of discharging a firearm in a DC pizza parlor was a complete inability to understand that a view he held might be wrong. The most important component of the best critical thinking that is lacking in our society today is humility. It is a simple yet profound notion: if we realize we don’t know everything, we can learn. If we think we know everything, learning is impossible. Somehow, our educational system and our reliance on the Internet has led to a generation of kids who do not know what they don’t know. If we can accept that truth, we can educate the American mind, restore civility, and disarm the plethora of weaponized lies threatening our world. It is the only way democracy can prosper. p.xx – We’ve created more human-made information in the past five years than in all of human history before them. Found alongside things that are true is an enormous number of things that are not, in websites, videos, books, and on social media. This is not just a new problem. Misinformation has been a fixture of human life for thousands of years and was documented in biblical times and classical Greece. The unique problem we face today is that misinformation has proliferated and lies can be weaponized to produce social and political ends we would otherwise be safeguarded against. p.xxi – Critical thinking doesn’t mean we disparage everything; it means that we try to distinguish between claims with evidence and those without. p.xxii – Info-literacy means being able to recognize that there are hierarchies in source quality, that pseudo-facts can easily masquerade as facts, and biases can distort the information we are being asked to consider, leading us to bad decisions and bad results. Sometimes the evidence consists of numbers and we have to ask, “Where did those numbers come from? How were they collected?” Part One – Evaluating NumbersPlausibilityp.3 – Statistics, because they are numbers, appear to us to be cold, hard facts. It seems that they represent facts given to us by nature and it’s just a matter of finding them. But it’s important to remember that people gather statistics. People choose what to count, how to go about counting, which of the resulting numbers they will share with us, and which words they will use to describe and interpret those numbers. Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations. And your interpretation may be just as good as, or better than, that of the person reporting them to you. Even if the numbers pass plausibility, three kinds of errors can lead you to believe things that aren’t so: how the numbers were collected, how they were interpreted, and how they were presented graphically. Part Two – Evaluating WordsHow Do We Know?p.123 – We are a storytelling species, and a social species, easily swayed by the opinions of others. We have three ways to acquire information: We can discover it ourselves, we can absorb it implicitly, or we can be told it explicitly. Much of what we know about the world falls in this last category – somewhere along the line, someone told us a fact or we read about it, and so we know it only secondhand. We rely on people with expertise to tell us. I’ve never seen an atom of oxygen or a molecule of water, but there is body of literature describing meticulously conducted experiments that lead me to believe these exist. We rely on experts, certifications, licences, encyclopedias, and textbooks. But we also need to rely on ourselves, on our own wits and powers of reasoning. p.124 – Suppose someone points you to a website that claims that listening to Mozart music for twenty minutes a day will make us smarter. Another website says it’s not true. A big part of the problem here is that the human brain often makes up its mind based on emotional considerations, and then seeks to justify them. And the brain is a very powerful self-justifying machine. It would be nice to believe that all you have to do is listen to beautiful music for twenty minutes to suddenly take your place at the head of the IQ line. It takes efforts to evaluate claims like this, probably more time than it would take to listen to Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Even the smartest of us can be fooled. Steve Jobs delayed treatment for his pancreatic cancer while he followed the advice (given in books and websites) that a change in diet could provide a cure. By the time he realized the diet wasn’t working, the cancer had progressed too far to be treated. Overlooked, Undervalued Alternative Explanationsp.161 – Cherry-picking – Our brains are built to make stories as they take in the vastness of the world with billions of events happening every second. There are apt to be some coincidences that don’t really mean anything. Counter-knowledgep.168 – Counter-knowledge, a term coined by the U.K. journalist Damian Thompson, is misinformation packaged to look like fact and that some critical mass of people believes. A recent US president-elect, having won the electoral college, claimed to have won the popular vote as well, when there was strong and documented evidence that that was not the case. The counter-knowledge was repeated. Shortly thereafter, a survey revealed that 52 percent of the president-elect’s supporters. Tens of millions of people, believed this falsity. It’s not just in politics that counter-knowledge propagates. Examples come from science, current affairs, celebrity gossip, and pseudo-history. Sometimes vast conspiracies are alleged, such as in the claims that the Holocaust, moon landings, and attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, never happened. Sometimes it is the outlandish claim that a pizza parlor is a front for a child sex ring run by the former U.S. Secretary of State. The intrigue of imagining “what if it were true” helps the fake story spread. Again, humans are a storytelling species. We love a good tale. Counterknowledge initially attracts us with the patina of knowledge and authority, but further examination shows that these have no basis in fact – the purveyors of counterknowledge are hoping you’ll be sufficiently impressed (or intimidated) by the presence of gritty assertions and numbers that you’ll blindly accept them. p.172 – The burden of proof for news articles and scientific articles is different, but without an explanation, even a tentative one, we don’t have much of a story. And newspapers, magazines, books – people – need stories. This is a core reason why rumors, counterknowledge, and pseudo-facts can be so easily propagated by the media, as when Giraldo Rivera contributed to a national panic about Satanists taking over America in 1987. There have been similar media scares about alien abduction and repressed memories. As Damian Thompson notes, “For a hard-pressed news editor, anguished testimony trumps dry and possibly inconclusive statistics every time.” Absolute certainty in most news stories and scientific findings doesn’t exist. But as humans, we seek certainty. Demagogies, dictators, cults, and even some religions offer it – a false certainty – that many find irreversible. p.177 – In New York City, Montreal; Flint, Michigan; and many other older cities, the municipal water supply is carried by lead pipes and the lead can leech into the tap water and cause lead poisoning. Periodic treatment-plant problems have caused city governments to impose a temporary advisory on tap water. Part Three – Evaluating the WorldLogical Fallaciesp.198 – The brain is a giant pattern detector, and it seeks to extract order and structure from what often appear to be random configurations. We see Orion the Hunter in the night sky not because the stars were organized that way but because our brains can project patterns onto randomness. p.201 – Framing Risk – A related problem in framing probabilities is the failure to frame risks logically. Even counting the airplane fatalities of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, air travel remained (and continues to remain) the safest transportation mode, followed closely by rail transportation. p.205 – Belief Perseverance – An odd feature of human cognition is that once we form a belief or accept a claim, it’s very hard for us to let go, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and scientific proof to the contrary. Conclusion – Discovering Your Ownp.251 – In George Orwell’s 1984, the Ministry of Truth was the country’s official propaganda agency, charged with falsifying historical records and other documents to reflect the administration’s agenda. The Ministry also advanced counterknowledge when it served their purposes, such as 2 + 2 = 5. 1984 was published in 1949, half a century before the Internet became our de facto information source. Today, like in 1984, websites can be altered so that the average person doesn’t know that they have been; every trace of an old piece of information can be rewritten, or kept out of reach. Today, it can be very difficult for the average Web surfer to know if a site is reporting genuine knowledge or counter-knowledge. Unfortunately, sites that advertise that they are telling the truth are often the ones that aren’t. in many cases, the word “truth” has been co-opted by people who are propagating counterknowledge or fringe viewpoints that go against what is conventionally accepted as truth. Even site names can be deceptive. p.253 – Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It’s an active and ongoing process. It requires that we all update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent, it should be considered part of an implicit bargain we’ve all made. Information gathering and research that used to take anywhere from hours to weeks now takes just seconds. We’ve saved incalculable numbers of hours of trips to libraries and far-flung archives, of hunting through thick books for the one passage that will answer our questions. The implicit bargain that we all need to make explicit is that we will use just some of that time we saved in information acquisition to perform proper information verification. Glossary:p.258 – Cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because two things co-occur, one must have caused the other. Correlation doe not imply causation. p.260 – Post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this, therefore because of this) – a logical fallacy that arises from thinking that just because one thing (Y) occurs after another (X), that x caused Y. X and Y might be correlated, but that does not mean a causative relation exists. "

I eat up the good stuff on critical thinking and this just appealed. Sure, there were few revelations for me, but the composition was refreshing and even though Levitin seems to churn out variations on a theme, this is my first by him, so gets a good nod from me. It gets an extra star because I like his coverage.Levitin covers a lot. And he covers it well. His writing makes for easy reading and easier digesting if you've never read anything on the subject. for those who have, it's a nicely packaged compendium with quotable sound bites. He addresses the usual numbers game, ... and also words. Lies, damn lies and...Statistics are not facts. They are interpretations.All right. Important safety tip. (and spot on). And when he talks about infographics? (""...often used by lying weasels to shape public opinion"" [my emphasis]) He's also spot on that ""they [the weasels] rely on the fact that most people won't study what they've done too carefully."" Rather disparaging to the much maligned weasels, similizing the ilk to them. Advising the reader, wisely, when encountering just about any claim: ""...ask yourself: How could anyone know such a thing?"" Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer? Well, of course, but equally obvious...advise so needed and ignored.On authority, he also advises (obviously) sagely:The first thing to do when evaluating a claim by some authority is to ask who or what established their authority. If the authority comes from having been a witness to some event, how credible a witness are they?And in a discussion later in the book he notes that ""Experience is Typically Narrow"" I recalled a discourse I had on The Petition Project...appeals to an ""authority"" beg the question as to the source of the authority; does the authprity have any pedigree at all on the subject in question? (Great pop culture reference in mind is the television show West Wing's character President Bartlet eviscerating a sham talk radio host for masquerading her PhD in English as some authority in divinity or psychology...) On things like Academy Awards - something I question when I actually take an interest - he makes a very good observation thatThe award system is generally biased toward ensuring that every winner is deserving, which is not the same as saying that every deserving person is a winner.Important distinction. There's a lot more here. I made a lot of electronic highlights and notes (that I should remember to save in event of another device glitch...) and though I like James Morrow's ""Science has all the answers. We just don't have all the science"", Levitin notes, ""Science doesn’t present us with certainty, only probabilities."" I might need to adjust my thinking. Highly recommended for the beginner and veteran. "
279,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23932589-christopher,4,"Levitin provides here a pretty straightforward treatise on the importance and how-tos of critical thinking. In three sections (numbers, words, the world), he breaks down some of the most common ways people manipulate information to lie straight to your face. He gets real creative, especially in the statistics areas, showing the many ways people can fudge numbers themselves or visually to say and mean almost anything they want. He also spends time discussing what it means to be an expert, what sources of information are most trustworthy, and some of the common logical fallacies one may come across. He spends a bit of time on some specific topics like anti-vaccination and David Blaine's breath-holding on Oprah, but it is otherwise pretty general, Levitin hopping from one example to the next rather rapidly.For some people, this is nothing more than a refresher or plainly redundant information. For a lot of others, it might be an important read. I am not sure if this is the best or even one of the better books on the topic, but I found it readable and understandable.Four/Five"
280,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27493200-joel-murray,4,"It was a good read and interesting book that details what to look out for when viewing/reading news and information.Much of it, particularly the statistics and graphs side, I already knew but it was a good reminder. The only issue with the book is that it's somewhere between preaching to the converted and a nice pat on the back. I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference. The people that need to know this stuff aren't the ones who are going to search out this book and those who do read the book probably think that everything that they're doing is okay. If you say to someone ""you really need to read this"" then they're not going to, let's face it, and if they do then it's bit rude on your part because you're implying they're wrong and need to be more like you.That's not really a flaw with the book though. The actual book is well written, has useful info and is quite short and easy to read."
281,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,4,"An extraordinarily useful and highly readable book that romps through the kind of logical processes (some of them mathematical, though nothing too testing) that we should go through when evaluating our information sources. A copy of this book certainly ought to be in every school library, but really it's we adults who need to read it -- especially at the moment, in a time when many people seem to think it's okay to subscribe to ""alternative facts"" and ""post-truth."" The trouble is that, as others have pointed out here on Goodreads (and I'm sure elsewhere), the very people who need most to read A Field Guide to Lies are the ones who're probably least likely to do so.Levitin's prose has an appealing conversational tone that can make even quite complex topics very approachable and certainly, for me, kept the pages turning."
282,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50969968-alfie-yee,2,"This by all accounts was a tough read. Whilst logically put together through arguments and case study, it presents information through probability models and thinking methodologies that I believe that are beyond what is capable on an average day without slowing or impeding how you live life. The book presents that the informational world that we live in today is a minefield of deceptions and lies put out by individuals knowingly or unknowingly serving a purpose. It is up to the average man/woman to navigate through this minefield with logical thinking tools and Bayesian probability model to guide him in the quest for truth. It is a battlefield guide of fighting through lies and counter knowledge. Interesting read but I doubt that I will remember anything."
283,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2948709-nico,4,"The first part (evaluating numbers) of this book is the one I enjoyed the most. Learning how the human brains work, how we process data e how we get mislead by them. It pushed me to implement a critical thinking towards number and not just news or what people say. The second part (evaluating words) was a bit more boring, I personally knew most of the things already but I can see how you can be or very interested or quite overwhelmed by it. The last part was again very surprising and I learned a lot from it, especially thanks to all the practical case scenario used to explain the different theories. "
284,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821447-betule-sairafi,3,"Kind of like an extension of Darrell Huff's How to Lie with Statistics (elibrary link), which is definitely required reading for anyone who feels like a naïve idiot and some people who feel like the opposite.If you want more of that, or if you have a statistics quiz coming up and your regular time-wasting activities feel too much like wasting time, try this book. It'll be like watching House to prepare for a medical test on ""things that are not Lupus."""
285,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19710738-h-ctor-iv-n-patricio-moreno,4,"This book gives you clear advise about how to avoid being fooled by incompetents and liars. The first part talking about statistics, graphical representation of data and methods of presenting and obtaining the information makes one wary of believing anything and puts the information on perspective, making you think what you REALLY now for sure and what have you heard and not verified. The doubts it implants in your mind are a great way of developing a more critical point of view and hardening your skills against being fooled. It has another part less mathematical but more analytical. It explains how it that science really don’t is about certainties but about possibilities, how to avoid believing in stupid theories and teach you a great deal about how to test an affirmation in its plausibility. I liked very much the advice it gives about the techniques used by bad guys in order to deceive you, for example attacking you with questions. If I could choose one part of the book as my favorite it would be the part about how it is far worse knowing something that isn’t true than not knowing anything about that. That stops us from searching the truth. As conclusion: Great advise about hoy to avoid COUNTERKNOWLEDGE. "
286,0525955224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9953567-jim-reaugh,5,"Having been raised in a religious cult, my powers of critical thinking have been sadly lacking. For many years, I had a difficult time differentiating between fact & fiction...That being said, I am glad to have read this book! It has given me some valuable tools to evaluate claims and get to the truth of the matter. From statistics & words to logical fallacies, this book was a real treat! A crash course in Skepticism 101, this book will be helpful to many. "
