0,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Interpersonal skills are especially important in Information Technology, because purely technical skills are easily outsourced. I've become increasingly aware of this since I launched my technology services company, OptimWise, because although many aspects of IT are based online, real business is still mostly done ""IRL"" (in real life); where face-to-face conversations and other social skills are much more important.A local entrepreneur recommended this book for its insights into the ""soft"" personal skills that become more important as they become rarer in the digital world. I didn't find a lot of practical information here. I don't disagree with Goleman's studies or analysis, but I rate non-fiction books based on the measurable value I get out of them, and I found his below average. The best non-fiction books are those that leave me with a long to-do list of improvements I can start on right away; this mostly confirmed that I need to continue developing my social skills. Although I didn't learn anything life-altering, it does present a powerful case for how important interpersonal skills are to success.According to Goleman,""Emotional Intelligence"" refers to your capacity to recognize your own feelings and those of others, for motivating yourself, and for managing emotions well in yourself and in your relationships. It describes abilities distinct from, but complementary to, academic intelligence, the purely cognitive capabilities measured by IQ. Many people who are book smart but lack emotional intelligence end up working for people who have lower IQs than they but who excel in emotional intelligence skills.""Why EI is more important than IQ- IQ only accounts for 25% of your career success, at most. - ""Soft"" skills matter even more in ""hard"" (technical) fields than other fields, because they make you stand out even more. - Emotional competencies are twice as important as technical/cognitive competencies. - The higher up or more advanced the job, the less important technical skills become, and the more important the interpersonal/emotional skills become. - At the highest levels of leadership, 90% of the skills required are emotional.- IQ is genetic, and doesn't change much after your teens, but EI is learned and can be improved throughout life. - Technical skills can be taught relatively easily in the classroom, but emotional skills must be obtained more difficultly through life experiences.Goleman fills the book with statistical data, firsthand reports, and dozens of examples of individuals and companies. He also includes several comparisons of people who began with similar skills and backgrounds, but one person developed their emotional competencies while the other focused on technical skills. Fast-forward a few decades, and those who concentrated on the emotional skills were more successful.Most of the book deals with EI at the individual level, but the later chapters talk about organizational intelligence. He suggests ways to train employees by focusing on honesty, openness, communication, and teamwork. Rather than each individual trying to be a star, they should instead help everyone else be a star.The 5 basic emotional and social competenciesSelf-awareness: Knowing what we are feeling in the moment, and using those preferences to guide our decision making; having a realistic assessment of our own abilities and a well grounded sense of self confidence.Self-regulation: Having control over our emotions so that they facilitate rather then interfere with the task in hand; being conscientious and delaying gratification to pursue goals; recovering well from emotional distress.Motivation: Using our deepest preferences to move and guide us towards our goals, to help us take initiative and strive to improve, and to persevere in the face of setbacks and frustrations.Empathy: Sensing what people are feeling, being able to take their perspective, and cultivating rapport and attunement with a broad diversity of people.Social skills: Handling emotions in relationships well and accurately reading social situations and networks; interacting smoothly; using these skills to persuade and lead, negotiate and settle disputes, for cooperation and teamwork. NotesTake time out to do nothing and reflect on your values and passions.Having skills isn't enough; you must believe in them to promote yourself.Train yourself to withstand ""amygdala hijacks"": when your brain responds to an emotional event by going into crisis mode, which halts complex thought and triggers knee-jerk responses.Balance the competencies. For example, too much self-control limits innovation.The most rewarding parts of work are the creative challenge and stimulation, and the chance to keep learning.Find your ""flow"": the state of mind where you're so engaged that you get lost in your work, enjoy the challenge, do your best work, and have fun.Set your goals so high that you only hit 50% of them.Declarative knowledge (knowing a concept and its technical details) isn't as valuable as procedural knowledge (being able to put the concept and details into action)."

The book develops a conscience in the readers to achieve something greater. As it suggests it is a really groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart.

My coworkers generally didn't know what hit them - using Goleman's analytic framework allowed me to maneuver project teams into win-win outcomes.Teaches you how to recognize impediments, how to understand what drives the other party's position (or at least how to figure out what that is), and best of all, how to use that knowledge. GREAT read for anyone who regularly negotiates."
3,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/599339-dmitry,1,"This book discusses a rather important issue, but it is really, really badly written. I was especially underimpressed by it against the backdrop of the recently read ""Thinking, fast and slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. The book is EXTREMELY long-winded. Long after it made its (perfectly convincing) point, it goes on and on piling one example on top of another in the style of chain letters, for further persuasion value adding a bunch of meaningless numbers: such and such billions of dollars of financial loss, so and so raise in the profits. Why would I care?The book is simply not interesting enough, and lacks cohesion. I probably wouldn't have thought so, wouldn't it be for ""Thinking: fast and slow"": I probably would have attributed my inability to become engaged by the book to my own lack of focus and attention.The book keeps quoting people from a firm called Hay/McBer where quotes are not called for - author could have stated the same obvious observation as coming from himself just as well. One wonders where that comes from - until one discovers that the author happens to work for Hay/McBer. Self-advertisement in a book pertaining to present scientific findings? Hm...The book is at times so badly edited, as to be simply unintelligible. See, for example, the end of page 25 and the beginning of page 28. I just couldn't figure this out, and I read it a bunch of times.And finally, the book makes some rather strong claims, that seem to be in contradiction to both the common sense and the scientific consensus. For example, it claims that intuition is all the rage, and we must all get attuned to our intuition. That in opposition to Daniel's Kahneman's book, which claims (with much more conviction) that intuition may, indeed, be useful (and correct) when it is a manifestation of a deep and prolonged experience, and can be spectacularly wrong when it is not (no forewarning is coming from Goleman). This makes the book outright dangerous for those who might take it's advice at face value (provided they make it through the whole book, which, I must admit, I didn't)."
4,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18619741-nga-dao-quynh,2,"First printed nearly 20 years ago, this book's content can deliver around 50% relevance now I guess, given the mushroom-ing of ""emotional intelligence"" and other buzzwords that come with it for the last two decades. We heard too much of them nowadays that the first half can be a  freaking  long and tiring read with many info we probably grow tired of hearing. Though I believe many ideas here are original, they're no longer new, even horribly lack update for recent developments, considering that many extensively increase research in this topic nowadays. Goleman did a thorough job in breaking down each competency involved with EQ - each accompanied by a quick anecdote. He had a lot of anecdotes in fact - nearly 40 pages of them summarized styled similarly to a reference section of a typical academic report - but I doubt I remember much of it, coz each was elaborated too swiftly and bear much resemblance to each other. So I'll assume this first half will better serve as a reference if you want a summary of what constitutes the whole term EQ, rather than how you would go about developing it. However I think the first step to understand something fully is to learn categorically what's in it. The second half is more interesting in how companies  (again 20 years ago, not nowadays)  trained their workers and their lack thereof in assessing the training outcomes. The author presented a syllabus of sorts to better the training and its assessment. To be honest I don't think it'll help me feasibly in a foreseeable future given that I'm an employee and have nothing to do with how to conduct or evaluate a training. It just emphasizes that I should read more up-to-date book to see if there are any improvements for the deficiency that was mentioned here. Goleman was lauded as a pioneer in proving the importance of EQ in organizations methodologically, academically and anecdotally. This book successfully illustrates just that."

Today's business atmosphere is changing rapidly, and anyone without emotional intelligence will likely find moving upward in their company very difficult. "
9,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7156523-c-g-fewston,1,"Working with Emotional Intelligence (1998) by Daniel Goleman is the sequel to the hit self-help book Emotional Intelligence first published in 1995, and the book is also a prime example of “professional nepotism” and “self-prohibited research.” Another alumnus of Harvard we far too often see on the bookshelves for no better reason than they attended Harvard, Daniel Goleman begins the book with an acknowledgments section which basically sets out an extended thanks to those he will later primarily use to quote as the main support for his thesis and ideas. As a result, the very experts he uses to support his claims of emotional intelligence are in fact his close friends and fellow colleagues from Harvard, which questions the very validity of his findings and claims in the book. If this were a PhD thesis, it would be rejected immediately. But it’s not. It’s a self-help book published to make profits for the publishing company.A few examples of the “professional nepotism” mentioned earlier, Goleman writes of Richard Boyatzis: “A colleague of David McClelland, and a good friend since our graduate school days at Harvard” (p ix). Goleman writes of David McClelland: “another main taproot of the thinking reflected here is my late friend David C. McClelland, formerly my professor at Harvard University” (p ix). Another interesting note: Richard Boyatzis was “a past president at Hay/McBer.” This might not mean anything on its own but Goleman adds about the company often cited on every other page or so throughout the 330-page book: “I was helped by many friends at the Boston office of Hay/McBer (the company David [McClelland] founded with David Berlew, a trusted advisor)” (p ix). So, David McClelland, co-founder of Hay/McBer, is also good friends with the author Daniel Goleman and Richard Boyatzis. Goleman goes on to cite many associates from Hay/McBer throughout the book as experts to support his claims on “emotional intelligence”: “Lyle Spencer Jr., director of research and technology worldwide and cofounder of what is now Hay/McBer, the consulting firm McClelland started” (p 19); “Ruth Jacobs, a senior consultant at Hay/McBer in Boston” (p 21); “So I again commissioned Hay/McBer to reanalyze their database” (p 33); “McClelland protégé, Lyle Spencer Jr., director of research and technology worldwide at Hay/McBer in Boston” (p 36); and, “Mary Fontaine of Hay/McBer” (p 38). The research cited and quoted gets to the point when you see the name Hay/McBer so often throughout the book you quickly realize the research is not extensive but cursory at best. Daniel Goleman even openly confesses he needed his data and facts checked and rechecked. So, who does he get to help double-check his research? Does he get an independent, unbiased company to audit his findings (as most professionals would)? No. Here’s Goleman in his own words: “To make sure my findings weren’t a fluke, I turned to Hay/McBer and commissioned them to do an independent study” (p 31). That’s right. Daniel Goleman used his friends and fellow Harvard graduates and colleagues to help check his all-important data and research. As you read Working with Emotional Intelligence, the educated mind begins noticing the trend of “professional nepotism” and “self-prohibited research,” which calls in to question the very research which is supposed to convince the educated reader the ideas of “emotional intelligence” from the 1990s are legitimate and trustworthy.In addition (because that’s not all), Daniel Goleman further confesses that his company is also in alliance with Hay/McBer: “I’m delighted to be working together with him [Richard Boyatzis] in my new venture, Emotional Intelligence Services, in an alliance with Hay/McBer” (p ix). What’s also interesting to note is that the Hay Group* (the company that owns Hay/McBer) takes credit for doing the initial research for this particular book: “In 1999, Daniel Goleman published Working With Emotional Intelligence with research conducted by the Hay Group” (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay_Group).*Note: “Hay Group is a global management consulting firm that works with leaders to transform strategy into reality. [They] develop talent, organize people to be more effective and motivate them to perform at their best. [Their] focus is on making change happen and helping people and organizations realize their potential.” (link: http://www.haygroup.com/us/about)You can also read more about Hay/McBer at the following website (which at the time of this review the site looks to be outdated and forgotten from the age of the 1990s) here: http://www.humandimension.org/haymcbe... Moving forward, Goleman further confesses that “professional nepotism” is vital for the success of “emotional intelligence” to even work. Lyle Spencer Jr., a former student of McClelland and director at Hay/McBer, boldly states:“But these stars spent lots of time with [their clients], wooing them, going out drinking, telling them about new technologies and product possibilities that would improve their clients’ products—so they didn’t just keep the account steady, but made more sales. What mattered was relationship building, sensing the client’s hot buttons and enthusiasms and knowing how to play to them” (p 37). By any intelligent indication from the above passage, “emotional intelligence” has nothing to do with the success of the “star performers” with their clients, but the fact that “wining and dining,” a now archaic form of doing business which remains for those who prefer to bribe clients with “money under the table.” Furthermore, the success of the star performers has more to do with “professional nepotism” and hours outside the office getting drunk and going to strip clubs and spending large amounts of money on clients, which has now become highly illegal in many countries around the world, including China, Vietnam and Japan. Goleman even cites an example on “favoritism” and how detrimental it can be to business:“Brought in to head a privately owned airline in a small Latin American country, he found the business a quagmire. The falling revenues were due to a legacy of cronyism and favoritism: The main sales agent for the airline was a close friend of the owner, and his contract was far more favorable than his competitors’, though his agency was weak in sales” (p 68).Oh, the irony is rich, isn’t it? To learn more about “cronyism and favoritism” in Harvard University and Harvard Business School, you can read What They Teach You at Harvard Business School: My Two Years Inside the Cauldron of Capitalism (2008) by Philip Delves Broughton, another alumnus of Harvard. Probably the most alarming piece of information is the indirect mention and explanation on how governments and the elites keep the “working class” people running in circles and running the usual rat race. Here’s Goleman explaining how the mental process works:“The prefrontal area is the site of ‘working memory,’ the capacity to pay attention and keep in mind whatever information is salient. Working memory is vital for comprehension and understanding, planning and decision making, reasoning and learning.“When the mind is calm, working memory functions at its best. But when there is an emergency, the brain shifts into a self-protective mode, stealing resources from working memory and shunting them to other brain sites in order to keep the senses hyperalert—a mental stance tailored to survival. “During the emergency, the brain falls back on simple, highly familiar routines and responses and puts aside complex thought, creative insight, and long-term planning. The focus is the urgent present—or the crisis of the day” (p 74).In sum, by keeping the “working class” people (basically the working majority) on a mental high alert created by subsistence living (paying people the least amount possible to survive and not thrive), the people will be too mentally exhausted to do anything other than to handle the problems of the day at hand: which would usually include paying bills or dealing with relationship and/or job issues. Later in the book, Goleman does mention some “secrets of success” and they are: “rapport, empathy, persuasion, cooperation, and consensus building” (p 229), and the secrets of “emotional competence” included are “astute political awareness, the ability to make arguments with emotional impact, and high levels of interpersonal influence” (p 259). Nevertheless, there does remain some useful tips, most likely repeated from the first book, that provide the usual and mundane characteristics of successful managers (p 40-41):•	Self-control: The successful stayed composed under stress •	Conscientiousness: The successful took responsibility by admitting their mistakes and failures•	Trustworthiness: The successes had high integrity•	Social skills: The successes were empathic and sensitive•	Building bonds and leveraging diversity: The successes were more appreciative of diversityOne of the single greatest insights in this book is probably the one that disrupts Goleman’s “emotional intelligence” logic and research the most, and it is “Systems Theory,” explained thus:“Systems theory tells us that in an environment of turbulent change and competition, the entity that can take in information most widely, learn from it most thoroughly, and respond most nimbly, creatively, and flexibly will be the most adaptive” (p 298). Furthermore, what’s truly interesting to note about all this research done by Goleman and/or the Hay Group is that it all boils down to “Gut Feelings” (p 50):“When it comes to decisions like these, our gut feelings—our deepest sense of what feels right and what is “off”—provide critical information that we must not ignore, lest we regret our choices.”In conclusion, regarding a recommendation for Working with Emotional Intelligence (1998) by Daniel Goleman, I’m going to have to trust my “gut” on this one and advise you to go ahead and skip this book. Goleman’s sequel to Emotional Intelligence (1995) doesn’t offer anything new, nor anything enlightening, and the whole book with its “self-prohibited research” and its blatant and open admission of “professional nepotism” just feels, in the words of Goleman, “off.” The book is “off” because its dated (published in 1998), it’s no longer valid in the real working world, it offers limited research (other than Harvard friends helping Harvard friends—which goes against the very principles of scholarly research), and it offers very little new light or new research (since the 1990s) on the twenty-first century work-life relationship. Let’s face it: people have changed since 1998 and this book should be officially retired from the bookshelves. Go ahead and skip this book.   "

This reservoir of emotional information can guide the individual in judgment-makingSelf-awareness encompasses three personal competencies: emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment, and self-confidenceThe brain’s working memory executes complex thought, long-term planning, reasoning, and comprehension. When individuals experience stress, the emotional centers of the brain tend to override the working memory, resulting in feelings such as anxiety, panic, or rageSelf-regulation requires the emotional and executive brain centers to operate jointly, vital for appropriately managing impulses and adverse circumstances. It is central to five personal competencies: self-control, trustworthiness, conscientiousness, adaptability, and innovationThe most powerful motivators are internal, not externalExciting or enjoyable work inspires people to do their best, but enjoyment derives from a state of mind called flow, not from the work itselfFlow occurs when a task engages all of the individual’s skills – or even requires learning new ones – and it is the ultimate motivatorThree personal competencies that most outstanding performers exhibit depend on motivation: achievement drive, commitment, and initiative/optimism (twin competencies)People gravitate to what gives them meaning, to what engages their commitment, talent, energy and skill. That can mean changing jobs to get a better fit with what matters to usPeople Skills– thirteen emotional competencies that fall into the social categories of empathy and social skillsUnderstanding others, service orientation, leveraging diversity, and political awareness are four important social competencies that build upon basic empathyThe classic mistake is assuming that if someone has a special expertise, it necessarily means they also have the ability to leadThe most effective leaders and performers in the workplace use empathy, or emotional radar, to gauge the reactions of others, and then, artfully respond in a manner that steers the interaction toward the desired outcomeSuch social skills are fundamental to five social competencies: influence, communication, conflict management, leadership, and change catalystThe four social competencies that typify star performers – building bonds, collaboration, cooperation, and team capabilities – rely on skills in social coordinationTeam performance can far surpass the sum of each member’s talents when the relationships among members create a synergy that maximizes everyone’s potential.

Understand what affects your moodEmotional strength enhances decision makingYour feelings add dimension to your choicesKeep a journal of behaviors you want to change, so you can analyze them later for clues about what sets off your ingrained emotional patternsYou must cultivate the space for emotional awareness, tune into it and explore it to get to know it. That requires downtime for quiet contemplation of your emotional reactionsFocus on one realistic goal at a time. To measure your progress, develop a plan that includes feedback"
11,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1136598-brian-rast,5,"The author, Goleman, explains how competencies of emotional intelligence (EI) can be applied to work life. Referred to as “the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships,” EI can be traced to 1983 when Howard Gardner proposed a model for “multiple intelligence.” Of Gardners seven, he included verbal and math, but he also had two that characterize and are consistent with Goleman’s book: 1) knowing one’s inner world and 2) social adeptness. Two other psychologists strengthened a comprehensive theory on EI in 1990 by defining it in terms of being able to monitor and regulate feelings, both one’s own and others’, to guide thought and action. The two main categories have five basic emotional and social competencies between them: I.	Personal Competencies that determine how we manage ourselvesa.	Self-Awareness- knowing one’s internal state, preference, resources, and intuitions (including emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment, and self-confidence)b.	Self-Regulation- managing one’s internal states, impulses, and resources (including self-control, trustworthiness, conscientiousness, adaptability, innovation)c.	Motivation- emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals (including achievement drive, commitment, initiative, optimism)II.	Social Competencies that determine how we handle relationshipsa.	Empathy- awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns (including understanding others, developing others, service orientation, leveraging diversity, political awareness)b.	Social Skills- adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others (including influence, communication, conflict management, leadership, change catalyst, building bonds, collaboration & cooperation, team capabilities)The book does a good job of emphasizing that at work, emotional incompetence can reduce everyone’s performance. Our work, and our careers, are only half dependent on technical skills. IQ may be as small as a third of what is really necessary: softer skills of EI. The electronic age with email and mobile connections, does not give people in work environments what they really need; they are desperate for a connection, for empathy, and for open communication. As an engineer/planner, EI competencies can help me interact with those outside my discipline and get things done more efficiently, because of the higher level of understanding that comes with the relationships. As a project manager, this is extremely important, especially when motivating a team is important. Developing competencies in each of the five areas, or being able to tap the full-spectrum of EI, allows project managers to perform in the top third of performance. Organizations, like the Corps, that are going through significant change, are those who need EI.(I have cut out much of my review because this website limits us to 10000 characters, and I had 12000...oh well) In summary, this is a book I hold up and believe is very good, on par with another good one by Covey, Seven Habits. The EI competencies shed light on some of the weaknesses I identified in taking the LLQ assessment during the PA program. I like how Goleman points out that these new understandings of the brain’s workings are important and need to be part of training. Although I hoped the book would have more information on techniques to implement or make these changes in myself. At least the book helps us understand what training is a waste- one being that people will change when they’re ready. The book helped me see where improvements at the Corps are needed. I liked when Goleman said, “Systems theory tells us that in an environment of turbulent change and competition, the entity that can take in information most widely, learn from It most thoroughly, and respond most nimbly, creatively, and flexibly will be the most adaptive.” This book fits well with the current events of the Corps and our Nation. I agree with him that having these competencies as skills will help each of us at the Corps survive with our humanity and sanity intact. As work changes, these human skills can help us improve ourselves and the capacity for pleasure, even joy, in the work we are doing in the Planning Branch and the rest of the district, even Corps-wide.

It seems that everyone I mention this to says he same thing.....There is a lot of emotional in the work place, but not very much intelligence! This is not a self help book, but one that explains what emotional intelligence is and how companies are beginning to realize that their bussiness can be effected by the emotions of their workers. My favorite quote is ""The ultimae act of personal responsibility at work may be in taking control of our own state of mind. Moods exert a powerful pull on thought, memory, and perception. When we are angry, we more readily remember incidents that support our ire, our thoughts become preoccpied with the object of our anger, and irritability so skews our world view that an otherwise benign comment might so strike us hostile. Resisting this despotic quality of moods is essential to our ability to work productively."" Many companies are now providing training in emotional intelligence. I wonder if it will ever be available in state government!Reading this over, I think I need to take a vacation, lighten up a little, get out the hammock and dive into my fiction stack!."

The organization of the book is a bit frustrating, with no clear direction of where Goleman is headed.The first book definitely had a greater impact on me.

Our age old beleif that one can only survive in this world with a brain high in IQ and competence inherent by birth was shattered for good. It provided deep insights into why people are how they are.In this book, Goleman delves deeper into how emotional competence makes people a better leader at the work place and in a social setting. Through studies and researches conducted across thousands of men and women, he has provided a good measure of clarity on how empathy, understanding and the many emotional capabilitles plays a major role at par with the technical and cognitive abilities. While becoming self-aware is the crucial factor for the development of the emotional quotient, it could be a lenghty process for some, but certainly achievable.The book is not an easy and fast paced read. It has to be chewed piece by piece and each chapter can have ideas overlapping from the previous chapter. "

While ""Emotional Intelligence"" is about how to understand emotional intelligence, this book is about how to practice it. Although Daniel Goleman mainly addresses the workplace and professional life in this book, still the knowledge provided can be effectively applied on the personal level and in dealing with the family."

28,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10372606-james,4,"I completed a Master's in Industrial / Organizational Psychology 7 years ago, and yet this is the first I/O Psych kind of book I read for fun.So. Emotional Intelligence. What is it, exactly? It's having an awareness of your own feelings, being able to recognize those feelings, and then knowing how to constructively handle those feelings. But wait there's more!Emotional Intelligence also involves being able to empathize with others, to understand the feelings that they experience, how to handle their actions, and how to motivate them to perform their best.""Ugh. Feelings. What does that have to do with work and getting the job done?""A lot. Organizations are full of people. People have feelings. Inside and outside of work. And surprise surprise!, the feelings individuals experience can greatly affect their own work and the work of others. So mayyyyyybe they're worth paying attention to. Until all of our jobs are taken over by soul-less robots. But I think we still have some time before that happens. At least a couple of years.So IQ, Intelligent Quotient, is the standard measure of intelligence. Even though the original concept and tests behind IQ were originally developed to determine if children had special needs, we seem to apply it to everything. In general, the higher the IQ, the better you are likely to be at school, your job, etc.However, it seems that IQ doesn't predict leadership skills. In fact, folks with higher IQ tend to be a liiiiitle more narcissistic and have a stronger desire to prove others wrong more than they do to get a cohesive team working together to accomplish goals. So... people with high IQ often find themselves working for, and making less than, those with lower IQs. Those leaders with higher EQs are better able to identify the needs of the members of their team and provide solutions. Neat!The alternative and often common scenario is that those with higher IQs do a great job at their assigned tasks to the point where they get promoted, and suddenly find themselves no longer working on the things they were before but instead managing a department. And hoo boy, that's a different beast. If you ever wondered why you had an incompetent jerk boss, it's probably because they were really good at their job once upon a time but moved up into a position they were never trained for. Behold, 
The Peter Principle
.The author gave the example that this would be like Michael Jordan, after winning the NBA championship game, was immediately promoted to coach of the Chicago Bulls. Just because the man is really really good at playing basketball does not mean he would do just as great a job coaching a team.I'd also like to point out that I'm pretty sure that's what happened to Michael Scott's character in The Office. The show implies he was a great paper salesman back in the day, and he eventually got promoted to the position of buffoon.So smart organizations realize there is a difference between work skills and leadership.There's a lot of other stuff in this book that makes you go ""well, duh"", but it's nice that it's scientifically backed up by case studies and laboratory experiments. Things like, hey, people in general are happier and more motivated and willing to take a pay cut to work somewhere that's more fun and laid back than somewhere tight-laced and more stressful, yet the work output is often the same.There are other neat tidbits like we expect women to be more empathetic that men, and while that's true in the sense that women are generally able to feel what other people are feeling, they are not necessarily more likely to know how to constructively handle the feelings of others, and do not have any sort of secret-feelings-detector in the workplace when their co-workers are trying to hide their emotions, whatever those may be. Statistically, women only have a teeny slight edge on men when it comes to Emotional Intelligence.Oh, and there's stuff in there about emotional contagion. People are able to feel what others feel although they may not always understand why. And of course, people may react to those not-understood feelings non-constructively. Be careful letting negativity and toxicity spread in the workplace.Overall a mildly interesting book to read. Nothing wow, earth-shaking, but you get a sense of feeling like a potentially better person after having read it."
29,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"When I first heard about emotional intelligence a number of years ago, it was described as a better predictor of success than IQ. In this book, Dr. Goleman repeats that claim and explains what it means. In professional fields, there is an IQ threshold for entry into the field, but once that threshold is met, emotional intelligence is a larger contributor to success than is IQ. I am really glad he made this clarification because the earlier formulation I had heard almost implied that someone with the IQ of Forrest Gump and a high level of emotional intelligence could be a more successful physicist than Albert Einstein, a completely nonsensical claim. The clarification makes much more sense.There are additional points made by Dr. Goleman that made a lot of sense and are very encouraging:•	Emotional intelligence is a learned behavior and can be taught. It is closely related to social skills, and I have noticed improvement in my own when people with better skills than my own have drawn my attention to weaknesses in my skills. For example, my ability to read non-verbal communication improved when certain signals were pointed out to me and their meanings explained. Prior to that, I had been clueless. So, with this history, I find very credible Dr. Goleman’s claims that emotional intelligence can be taught and learned.•	The ability to learn emotional intelligence improves with age, especially after one’s twenties. Based on my memories of high school and the Navy after high school, I think it is safe that the average emotional intelligence of my peers and myself was on par with that of a lab rat, and I think I dealt with a few individuals that had less emotional intelligence than a garden snake. My own history of social awkwardness in my younger days and improvement in social skills with maturity helps to validate this claim.•	While women tend to have higher levels of emotional intelligence than men, with training, men can be just as competent as women in this area. Very encouraging words, indeed.While reading this book, I learned something that has nothing to do with emotional intelligence but I would like to share anyway. In a note, Dr. Goleman quotes a statement made by Nobel laureate Ernest O. Lawrence and passed on to him by Alvin M. Weinberg, a former director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). It turns out that Weinberg was Dr. Goleman’s uncle. When I was a nuclear engineering student at the University of Tennessee in the mid-90’s, Dr. Weinberg would come to the Nuclear Engineering Department or to American Nuclear Society meetings and reminisce about the Manhattan Project or days gone by at ORNL. If Dr. Goleman reads this review, I want him to know that I enjoyed listening to his uncle’s stories, especially one about Leo Szilard and an arranged date."
30,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15874991-rehmat,4,"Leadership and emotional intelligenceA review by Remat Chinggisi 	While exchanging views on books with my boss, he suggested me to go through Siimon Reynold’s Why People Fail. It was winter-2013, in January. Later that year, I found hard copy of the book, Why People Fail, and read it. The book devotes one entire chapter on emotional intelligence, famously known today as EQ, which causes failure if a person fails to diagnose what cause to stir up his emotions and how to regulate his emotions. This chapter of the book further motivates me to read a separate book on emotional intelligence in entirety. This idea remained in my subconscious until recent past, and I got a copy of Working with Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. Quoting New York Time’s review on the title, “Anyone interested in leadership should get a copy of this book”, caught my attention to read it. 	The book comprises five chapters consisting of several sub-headings which explain different aspects of EQ quoting practical examples happening in daily life. The first chapter “The New Yardstick” starts with shift in organizational approach towards concept of “job”, being replaced by “portable skill” making us employable. Previously known as “character”, “soft skills”, “personality” and “competence”, a new name for these human talents is known as “emotional intelligence”. 	The framework of emotional competence is primarily personal. This personal competence determines how we manage our emotions and subsequently ourselves. “Self-awareness” is the most important ingredient of the competence. This enables to diagnose and recognize one’s emotions. “Accurate self-assessment” makes known one’s strengths and limits while “self-confidence” gives one’s self-worth and capabilities. Second stage of the framework explains “self-regulation”. How a person manages one’s internal feelings, impulses and resources. “Self-control” is the most essential element of self-regulation through which one keeps check on emotions and impulses. Exhibiting “adaptability” to handling change and flexibility with innovative ideas and new information are parts of the self-regulation. Social competence comes within the outline of emotional competence. Empathy and awareness of others’ feelings, needs, concerns, political awareness with emotional currents and power relationships are factors defining social competence we need to be equipped with. Leadership with guiding, conflict management with negotiating and resolving disagreements, communication linked with art of listening, and collaboration with cooperation towards shared goals are those social skills connected squarely within the boundaries of emotional competence. 	Goleman argues that emotional competence is particularly central to leadership, a role whose essence enables to do jobs more effectively. A leader’s strengths and weaknesses in EQ can be easily measured in the gain or loss of an organization. The absence of emotional competence results in lowering performance of team, wastes time, creates acrimony corrodes motivation and commitment, and builds hostility and apathy. 	Another detailed chapter of the book is devoted on “self-mastery”. Recognizing one’s emotions and their effects is basic part of emotional awareness, being pillar of self-mastery. People equipped with this competence know which emotions they are feeling and why. They realize the links between their feelings and what thoughts pass through their minds. They further realize that how their feelings affect their performance. Excelling with this competence makes aware one’s emotions at any given time. This competence never let emotional drag or stirring feelings hinder and sabotage efforts. Self-mastery with emotional competency boosts self-confidence despite obvious uncertainties and pressures. Any lack of self-confidence confirms lack of emotional competency. The absence of self-confidence manifests itself in feelings of helplessness, powerlessness and crippling self-doubt. However, extreme self-confidence should also be shunt likewise its absence as it, on the other hand, makes look arrogance if the person lacks social skills. 	Elaborating EQ with scientific reasoning, Goleman refers to brain studies. Brain secretes cortisol hormone also known as stress/emotional hormone when a person under stress, emotional feelings, sadness, anger, panic, mood disorder, provocation, crisis, anxiety, worry, upset. Once brain secretes cortisol hormone it stays in body for hours. Successive upsetting incidents add more this hormone in the body already there. The secretion of stress hormone shots ups heart beat, shunts away blood from the brain to other parts of the body, jumps blood sugar, and climbs hreat rates preparing body to fight and run. Cortisol steals energy resources from working intellect of memory, makes people more errors, more distracted and more loss of memory. For this reason, it makes mandatory for a person with self-control and impulse-control.	The third chapter is titled as “people skills”. This chapter covers social skills in details. Goleman explains in this part of his book the social radar, diversity, handling stereotypes’ outlooks, social trends, political awareness, handling others’ emotions, communication, resolving conflicts, leadership skills, accepting change and change catalyst, cooperative working relationships, building social networks and team work. Yet, the second last chapter elaborates a new model of learning, understanding emotional training, avoiding emotional blunders and practices with emotional intelligence/competency with presenting numerous examples. Yet, the final chapter is “the emotionally intelligent organization”. This chapter is most relevant to managerial leadership with emotional competence in an organization. How EQ is linked to performance, efficiency and effectiveness of an organization. How to maximize organizational EQ. How getting things done with stress-free productivity in an organization.	Though, the book guides us that we are being seen and judged with new yardstick i.e. emotional intelligence. It shows dark side of human emotions resulting to failure and serious consequences to bear if we fail to develop self-awareness of our emotions. The book makes its reader ennui at many stages when repetitions occur or cites lengthy examples unnecessarily. However, what make this book distinctive are the hidden aspects of human emotions everyone needs to know. The author has made tireless efforts in collecting facts, data and examples related to emotional intelligence. It is essential read, to re-quote New York Times, “Anyone interested in leadership should get a copy of this book”, and read it in its entirety. Complement it with Why People Fail by Siimon Reynolds.  "
31,0553378589,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39569485-eugenie,3,"This book taught me that EQ is really important and the author gave many examples of how one person is chosen for the job although he is not as competent but has the highest EQ. Or how a culture in a company that really cares for the people like family has high productivity. How people will stay for the job if they feel like their boss cares. How the stress of a boss relationship can affect your help and make you more prone to being sick. (Agreed)How the merger of 2 companies when the CEO says something along the lines of we will sort through all the people contributions over the years and make a fair decision who will stay and who will go. People will feel less hostile than the CEO saying something along the lines of we will fire people because of double roles in the company so everyone better produce more results.About how a company got a new CEO and pushed the employees too hard no one had work life balance. In the end the culture of the company was totally messed up and no one want to work for the company anymore.All in all the author puts that EQ is important, and I have to agree with this that it plays quite a big role in society and should be given more weight. I want to find a book about bettering my EQ right now. 3 stars because I learnt that EQ is important in many areas but I have no idea how to improve it after reading this book. It has left me in the same spot, leaving me confounded and unsatiated. Why? My fear of an impending doom and failure in life because of my lack of EQ multiple areas of my life and multiple past mistakes >.< ouch! One good thing is that EQ can be learnt according to the author.Skills:Self motivation Self regulation Motivation EmpathySocial skillsThreshold competencyDistinguished competency"

Goleman’s work Emotional Intelligence is a must read. His follow up work Working with Emotional Intelligence is a big skip. You do not get any new information here.

Well, because I now think these ""self-help"" books are no longer worth my time reading cover to cover and so I made notes on the first few chapters, which will hopefully be useful, but found that the latter parts of the book do not apply to me - they seem like the backbone to running an ""emotional intelligence"" course. Perhaps I should actually read/skim Goleman's original book instead and my harsh rating isn't wholly justified, but that's my reasoning anyway."
