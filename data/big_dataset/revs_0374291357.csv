0,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"What the author was going on about and what I particularly liked here is that there is nothing simple about human mind. A verifiable psychopath can have a bunch of traits that anyone can have (probably not all at the same time, still, a bunch of those). A healthy person can have exactly same things.For example, if you meditate, theta waves will be more often appearing on your EEG. Psychopaths (according to this researcher) have theta waves more often as well. Does meditation make you psychopathic? I doubt it. Another interesting tidbit to consider: we can't diagnose psychopathy reliably. We can't even diagnose depression or bipolar or OCD or ADHD or pretty much anything else reliably. Fore more on this one can refer to the Rosenhan experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenha.... Yes, it's old. Have things gotten better? Why should they have? I don't think so. We just won't see any today's experiments of this eloquence: the medical industry is not going to let such things happen, anymore. The industry is lucrative and foolproof (try proving you aren't insane, ADHD, depressive, etc... ). Spoiler: you can't prove a negative. And to prove a positive you just have to check a bunch of inane questions, like: have you been feeling restless? do you often feel distracted? Even the way such questionnaires are built can affect our responses (positive/negative questions, the order of questions, priming... ), so if you are to be considered ill, you will be, whatever you do.For one thing, it's dreadfully easy to go about our respective lives sticking labels at people: - You are feeling restless? ADHD is your problem, have some prescription drugs and be gone! You'll be stoned but you won't be distracted...- You want to be a surgeon/spy/policeman/priest? Psychopath, that's what you are - here are some handcuffs and obligatory therapy (and a surgery, maybe?) and a ban from some jobs and... whatever our society comes up with next...We have somehow gotten prone to villainizing or glorifying conditions. Bipolar becomes a trademark of creativity, psychopathy of evilness... It's no good, since there is no absolute normality. Everyone is abnormal in some way and medicating everyone into uniformity is not the best way to go about building a healthy society.Q:Theta waves are associated with drowsy, meditative, or sleeping states. Yet in psychopaths, they occur during normal waking states, even sometimes during states of increased arousal. (c)Q:Traits that are common among psychopathic serial killers, Kouri observes—a grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others—are also shared by politicians and world leaders: individuals running not from the police, but for office. Such a profile... allows those who present with it to do what they like when they like, completely unfazed by the social, moral, or legal consequences of their actions. (c)Q:Psychopathy is like sunlight. Overexposure can hasten one’s demise in grotesque, carcinogenic fashion. But regulated exposure at controlled and optimal levels can have a significant positive impact on well-being and quality of life. (c)Q:I think the problem is that people spend so much time worrying about what might happen, what might go wrong, that they completely lose sight of the present. They completely overlook the fact that, actually, right now, everything's fine. You can see that quite clearly in your interrogation exercise. What was it that chap told you? It's not the violence that breaks you. It's the threat of it. So why not just stay in the moment? (c)Q:I realised from quite early on in my childhood that I saw things differently from other people,' he wrote. 'But, more than not, it's helped me in my life. Psychopathy(if that's what you call it) is like a medicine for modern times. If you take it in moderation it can prove extremely beneficial. It can alleviate a lot of existential ailments that we would otherwise fall victim to because our fragile psychological immune systems just aren't up to the job of protecting us. But if you take too much of it, if you overdose on it, then there can, as is the case with all medicines, be some rather unpleasant side effects. (с)Q:These eight independent satellite states of the psychopathic personality--Machiavellian Egocentricity, Impulsive Nonconformity, Blame Externalization, Carefree Nonplanfulness, Fearlessness, Social Potency, Stress Immunity, and Coldheartedness. (c)Q:... Psychopaths are shadowmancers', the agent tells me, a large-scale map of the US dotted with timelines, hotspots and murderous crimson trajectories plastered across the wall behind his desk. 'They survive by moving around. They don't have the same need for close relationships that normal people do. So they live in an orbit of perpetual drift, in which the chances of running into their victims again is minimised. (c)Q:Because of these exaggerated dopamine responses, once they focus on the chance to get a reward, psychopaths are unable to alter their attention until they get what they're after. (c)Q:The results were extraordinary. Over 70 percent of those who scored high on the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale correctly picked out the handkerchief-smuggling associate, compared to just 30 percent of the low scorers. Zeroing in on weakness may well be part of a serial killer’s toolkit. But it may also come in handy at the airport. (c)"
1,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1297258-e,3,"So, this was disappointing.In sum, this book is about how some psychopathic qualities are actually really helpful and positive and incorporating them into your life can make you succeed. They can reduce anxiety and depression, make you more productive, and even make your more empathetic (although if you're a true psychopath with sadistic tendencies, the empathy payout is getting to enjoy the suffering of your victims more ... so, this isn't a heartwarming ""hope for psychopaths"" book).Look, I'll be honest. I was kind of jealous of psychopaths after reading this book. I mean, I'd love to react to all situations in a cold and calculating manner, with a accompanying drop in blood pressure and heartrate. I'd love to be able to never take things personally, see projects through doggedly to the end, and keep myself from fearing by staying strictly in the ""now."" (And as far as getting that message across, it was more effective in this medium for me than those crunchy feely Eckhert Tolle books). I was actually approaching this book as a kind of self-help manual, because lawyers are really high on the psychopath list and if you can't beat them, join them. (Well, only for working hours, that is.)What annoyed me is after all the promising studies, Dutton doesn't really tell us HOW to make the more positive traits of the psychopath into our own. While I understand part of the premise is that they're jsut ""wired that way"" (the author himself has part of his brain treated to feel like a psychopath for an afternoon). What I would've liked is something in the cognitive behavioral realm to get there. (There was also a mention of the dopamine-inhancing properties of amphetamines so I guess if all else fails ...) Instead, he wasted pages boycrushing on Special Forces agents, cops, and his childhood psychopathic friend who I'm unclear why he kept. Nope, he punted that to TIBETAN MONKS MEDITATING. Look, Tibetan monks have been doing that for a while. How about something more approachable?At the very least, it would've been considerate of him to include the questionnaire used to measure the index of one's own psychopathic tendencies, even if I was just a little morbidly curious after discovering I have not issues whatsoever shoving fat guys in front of streetcars to save other people. Since most of the studies use this as a basis to pick their subjects and control group, it would've been helpful.That said, I still learned enough from this book not to make it a tossup, but in the realm of essays on weird psychological phenomenon and its relevance, this had nothing on other books and lacked a real tongue-in-cheek (his OWN tongue, mind you) feel that probably would've made it roll a bit better. Instead, I felt like the author got too absorbed in exhibiting his comfort level around those tough manly manly psychopaths. The lack of female psychopaths in this book was also a real problem, even though he did point out they are the minority a contrast would've been nice since I think dealing with psychopathic females always has its own issues. In fact, given that he was targeting the ""most successful psychopaths"" and singing their praises to high heaven, some rep of the fairer sex would've been much appreciated. I mean, we're allowed to be lawyers now - even CEOs, the number ONE profession where you have a tendency to be a psychopath.Stil, a quick read to break in my new Kindle. Not bad if you want to learn that a psychological label doesn't turn you into Hannibal Lecter, not so great when you'd prefer to learn how to serve the other side its own kidneys at trial. "
2,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,0,"Mostly, this book was too technical for my personal reading-taste....but I think I got the basic point: WE ARE ALL A LITTLE BIT CRAZY! Everyone can be a psychopath: Business leaders, CEO's, sales people, traders, athletes, soldiers, TV & Radio workers, journalists, lawyers, surgeons, etc. Also---its more nature than a nurture thing.The author spends a good time in this book talking about 'Functional Psychopaths' --(in other words not all psychopaths are damaging to society). I couldn't help but wonder....""Yeah, but did the author spend times with their families""? How were those 'families' functioning? I wasn't sure what to make of the Quizes in this book....(self analysis) --The purpose of the quizzes was to have readers see (once again) that we all have psychopath tendencies. ----[""Functional""] Some basic characteristics of these psychopaths are: They may be charming, have an acute ability to read emotions in other people without being moved themselves, ruthlessness, intense capacity to focus, confident, mental resilience, antisocial traits, persuasiveness, lack of empathy, superficial charm, egocentricity, etc. One little detail I did find interesting (was the difference between the inner physical chemistry of a psychopath and a person who is not). For example: In times of stress, most people's heart rate goes UP ---but in a psychopath it drops. The BIG QUESTION I'm left with --(which still did NOT really get answered for me is -- ""WHERE"" is the 'WISDOM"" in the psychopath? I have a hard time putting those two words in the SAME sentence myself! NOTE: My local book club will discuss this book together next week ---(I'm sure I'll come away with feeling a little more 'enlighten' with the support of our group talk) "
3,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13080935-simon-fay,1,"In so far as dishing out some interesting facts on psychopathy this was a decent read. I'm all for learning the on/off switches that control what we define as our personalities and the book delivers on that front.In terms of pointing out worthwhile lessons to be taken from the personality disorder it was oddly biased (the author claims his father and best friend are psychopaths) and even more muddled. It makes a case that there are some instances where having a 'me me me' philosophy is beneficial to yourself (duh) but makes absolutely no coherent case for how it's beneficial for society as a whole. It's an instruction manual on how to come out on top when the ship is sinking, rather than a book on how to fix the damn hole in the boat.The author uses the game of 'chicken' to illustrate a possible instance where being a psychopath is a good thing, that the man who keeps his foot down on the pedal wins over the man who swerves out of the way. In terms of stats, I'm sure this plays out often enough for it to be a fun thought. In terms of applying it to international politics, I think one Cuban missile crisis is enough for the next millennium. Thanks anyway. I think I'd like some dudes in charge who don't get us into that game in the first place.It's rare that I'm bothered to write a review and having done so now I'm second guessing myself - maybe the book was pure satire? A Ferenghi's guide to surviving humanity? In any case, I doubt many readers would take it that way."
4,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8112718-kare-anderson,5,"Ironically, both psychopaths and Tibetan monks detect deep emotions that are invisible to others. Psychopaths are much better at recognizing “those telltale signs in the gait of traumatized assault victims” notes The Wisdom of Psychopaths author, Kevin Dutton. Tibetan monks, steeped in meditative practice, are also especially adept at reading feelings that are hidden from the rest of us, Paul Ekman discovered. Ekman, is the preeminent expert on lying and on the six universally expressed emotions in the face — anger, sadness, happiness, fear, disgust and surprise. Scarily, psychopaths score especially high on the Hare Self-Report Scale of psychopathy in seeing those core expressions, especially the ones that make us most vulnerable, fear and sadness, according to Sabrina Demetrioff.Another astounding finding was that, in lab tests, a Tibetan monk had no startle reflex reaction to “a gun being fired just centimeters away from the ear: the maximal threshold of human acoustical tolerance,” reports Dutton - yet others despite that finding. Ekman, and his co-researchers, Robert Levenson and Richard Davidson, concluded, according to Dutton, that “practicing a relaxed state of mind” is conducive to “keeping a cool head at one time or another.” Yet it appears that psychopaths don’t need that meditative practice to stay calm under pressure and or to be inordinately observant, especially of weaknesses in others. Psychopaths feel little or none of the arousal reactions (heart beat, sweat, blood pressure, etc.) that others have when viewing “a series of horrific, nauseating and erotic images,” found Dutton. Like the monks, psychopaths have greater self-mastery of their emotions. Unlike the monks, however, they seem to be born with this capacity to not feel nor react.That may not be the most surprising conclusion from Dutton’s book however.Unlike our common impression of psychopaths as dangerous serial killers, and some are, others use their high-performing capacity to remain calm in stressful times to conduct surgery, lead soldiers or become sought-after CEOs. After all, as Dutton suggests, if you’re having brain surgery, wouldn’t you want someone who is not distracted by feelings and completely in control and concentrating on the operation? If your life were in danger on the battlefield, wouldn’t you want someone who could coolly survey the situation and deeply recognize others’ reactions, to determine the best way to rescue you? Psychopaths adept detection of vulnerability is one of their most potent skills. See more at http://www.forbes.com/sites/kareander..."
5,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262996-kate-woods-walker,1,"Psychopaths are not misunderstood geniuses with much to teach us about how to be human, as the author contends. They are murderers, rapists, child molesters and criminals of every stripe. They are Wall Street cheats and ruthless dictators. They are cult leaders, con men and reprobates.I agree with the esteemed Martha Stout about this book. Here's what she had to say in The New Republic: http://www.newrepublic.com/book/revie....Dutton seeks to normalize the horrors of the psychopathic personality, by selectively presenting the research of others, surrounded by souped-up prose. He should be ashamed of himself, but I suspect that's an impossibility."
6,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14966031-breakingviews,3,"By Martin LangfieldIf you’ve ever thought your boss is a psychopath, you may be right, according to psychologist Kevin Dutton. And if you’re a top-flight markets trader, captain of industry, surgeon or soldier, you may well be one yourself. But that’s OK, says Dutton. It may even be optimal. “The Wisdom of Psychopaths,” an exploration of serial killers, monks, spies and CEOs through the prism of personality tests and neuroscience, is a good book lurking within a bad one. In this regard it perfectly reflects its theme, which is that among the dark traits which make a person psychopathic nestle behaviors and abilities that are not only necessary, but good, for individuals and society. In the seeds of evil, he proposes, wisdom may be found. An Oxford University research psychologist, Dutton may discomfit many readers with an almost adolescent joy in mixed metaphors and grating puns, relishing the shock value of his premise as he liberally applies the term “psychopath” to all kinds of people. It may sound like he is suggesting sadistic ax-murderers or serial rapists lurk within all men, but his point is rather more subtle. Perhaps this approach is a deliberate attempt to open the reader’s mind to new ideas. Or perhaps he needs a more restrained editor. Still, a razor-sharp intellect with a serious academic purpose lurks behind the loose phrasing and wordiness. Dutton stacks up references to interlocking personality studies, brain scans and physiological examinations, comparing members of the general population with those behind bars and those who excel at certain sharp-end professions. His argument is that most “psychopaths” aren’t violent, and indeed most aren’t locked away. Many excel in society precisely because they possess, in a more moderate or controlled way, the same traits that land their more antisocial brethren in a world of hurt. The key traits include: ruthlessness; intense capacity to focus, excluding all distractions such as fear; powerful reward motivation; a disposition to action; acute ability to read emotions in other people, without being moved by them; charisma; mental resilience; and mindfulness, the ability to live in the present moment. Many people have some of these traits, he says. Those who can manage to flick them on and off according to circumstance have a powerful toolkit for doing well in life, particularly in high-risk, high-reward professions. Those with only partial control of such traits, or who have them jammed full-on all the time, may severely hurt others, ruin their own business or even damage the world economy. Those who lack any such traits should try to embrace a few, Dutton suggests. In examining CEOs, Dutton also cites a 2005 academic study that compared business managers, psychiatric patients and hospitalized criminals in a psychological profiling test. “A number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals,” Dutton writes, listing attributes such as superficial charm, egocentricity, persuasiveness, lack of empathy, independence, and focus. The main difference lay in the “antisocial” traits, with the criminals’ physical aggression, impulsivity and lawbreaking dials cranked up higher. One of Dutton’s own surveys, in which visitors to his website take a personality test called the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and give details of their professions, found that CEOs ranked highest on the scale, followed by lawyers, TV and radio workers, salespeople, surgeons and journalists. Dutton interviews “functional psychopath” special-forces soldiers, financial traders, lawyers and doctors, often in exotic locales, who speak of experiencing altered states of consciousness when entirely focused on their work, akin to the concept of “flow” or “optimal experience” of Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. One of the most intriguing of Dutton’s insights is the similarity he relates between certain psychopathic traits and those exhibited by experts in Buddhist meditation. Both are very good, for example, at reading emotions in people’s faces, embracing new experiences, remaining in the moment and practicing detachment. To say psychological traits required in killing and in making a killing in the markets are not dissimilar may seem trite. Yet Dutton, despite his tendency to showboat, uses that observation as a starting point for a disconcerting and intelligent exploration of the outer reaches and useful inner depths of at least some human minds."
7,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/707579-marija-s,3,"I guess I expected too much from this one.It is not so much that it left me unconvinced, but I still have trouble with discerning what Dutton's hypothesis was in the first place. The book appears to be a mumbo jumbo of anecdotes, scientific article and book excerpts, snaps from interviews, lectures, conversations. It is easy to read and has insightful points which remain just that - points of reference for further exploration - but I often failed to grasp the meaning the author was trying to underline by them. I have encountered the term 'psychopath' while studying criminal and related laws, and it did help a lot as a background for this book, because the author left out some pretty important things like statistics (e.g. gender distribution), how do psychopaths function when they're not breaking moral/legal norms (relationships, friendships, offspring care,..), how to test yourself to see where you are on the scale, etc.. but for example got into explaining some relatively uninteresting and tedious interpretations of traits in psychology testing. Also, to jump from theme to theme without reaching any conclusion or drawing a line, just to be brought back to the same topic only with an additional example, is a repetitive and tiring practice of this author. The biggest minus of this book (apart that it is popular science, with a big emphasis on 'popular') is that it painfully lacks structure and a clear way of presenting a thesis. Sometimes, while reading, I was under the impression that the interviewees should be the ones writing a book (which most of them, accidentally, did) and that this book is just some guy stealing crumbs off tables of experts, investigators, real life psychopaths, etc. and not doing a top notch job out of it either.In short, psychopaths are not 'wise', they are simply differently hard-wired.At least this book cleared out for me why I disliked politicians and lawyers. And James Bond. "
8,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275281-william,4,"The Wisdom of Psychopaths begins with a few strikes against it. First, one suspects the publisher commissioned it as a knockoff of Jon Ronson's The Psychopath Test, published a year earlier. Second, it's vaguely framed as a self-help book, although it never really commits to the concept.Regardless of the publisher's intention, Kevin Dutton turns out to hold the better credentials—he's a research psychologist at Oxford University—and acquits himself well as a nonfiction author. (He can be forgiven for not being quite as fun as Ronson; few are). Already familiar with the real-life test of Ronson's title, although I have not read his take on the subject, I gave in to the ""wisdom"" hook and plowed ahead.The Wisdom of Psychopaths moves as quickly and entertainingly as any survey of research and literature can, not just of psychopathy—which to me is inherently fascinating—but theories of personality in general, and the experiments behind them. I later read that Ronson had been criticized for taking some liberties with the research; in this way, if Dutton's book was at all intended a follow-on, it seems less a me-too entry and more like a corrective by someone from the field.Dutton also makes a persuasive enough case that certain character traits associated with psychopathy—charm, focus, and fearlessness, among others—can be advantageous, if one can keep it in check. For anyone who wants to get ahead (unsurprisingly, in business especially) it can help to become something of a ""method psychopath"". Alas, Dutton doesn't spend much time with that, but if he writes that as a follow-up, I'll be there."
9,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877807-persephone,3,"Last autumn, I came across this article in the Globe and Mail which includes an interview with author Kevin Dutton and an overview of his book The Wisdom of Psychopaths. I felt a dropping in my stomach as I read it, because at the end of the article were two lists: one denoting leadership traits, the other the corresponding psychopathic traits. The first list came fairly close to describing my father. The second list pretty much nailed him. I sat in a mild state of shock for a few minutes, then logged into my local library's web site and put a hold on the book.Dr Kevin Dutton begins The Wisdom of Psychopaths with tales of his own father and his father's audacity. Neither Dutton's dad nor mine was a serial killer (so far as I know). This is the point. We use the term ""psychopath"" as a synonym for ""serial killer"". This isn't so, and Dutton is by no means the first person to make this point. Most of us probably personally know people living with autism, Parkinson's Disease or schizophrenia. (I certainly do.) Why wouldn't we also know functional psychopaths?Dutton describes how the very qualities that help politicians, surgeons, military intelligence operatives, CEOs and sales people rise in their professions and succeed in what they need to do are similar to the traits shared by some of the most dangerous people in our society. He calls these ""The Seven Deadly Wins"": ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness (as in living in the here and now), and action (""Psychopaths,"" Dutton declares, ""never procrastinate."").As I read, I thought of the possible psychopaths I'd encountered in my own life: a boy at school who could turn friendliness on and off when it suited him, a teaching partner whose relationships with the students we shared made me uneasy, at least two of the Resident Fan Boy's bosses, and yes, my own charming, reckless, and heartless father.I admit, though, I'm nothing but an armchair psychologist and this book, written in a glib, popular-science style, is nothing more than food for thought. An interesting read, but not something on which to base your life philosophy. Unless, like a psychopath, you have little in the way of a conscience."
10,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17208123-marta,2,"This rating has a lot to do with my expectations, but also with the fact that I don't agree with the author's view. I'm a psychology student and like many people I'm interested in psychopaths and how their minds work. My roommate got this book from one of her friends and because she gave up on it, I ended up reading it to see how it is. So, I went almost blindly in this one, not knowing what to expect. From the title and the synopsis, I was expecting stories about popular psychopaths, like Ted Bunty and so on. This book is more general than that, it presents some theories, some studies about psychopaths, about how some of them are functional (actually have important functions in our world). They are businessmen, politicians, lawyers and judges and the author wonders if we should learn something from psychopaths, if we should learn to be focused on the present, to have a cold empathy (focused on perception) rather than a warm one (focused on feelings).  Then he started with all this debate about how we are all turning into psychopaths because of social media and so on. Let's agree to disagree. I'm tired of hearing all these stupid remarks about my generation being full of narcissists, I feel like we're rather the most insecure generation out there because of social media.  I think some of his theories were interesting, but he went a little too far. While it's important to make people aware that some psychopaths are among us and not all of them are criminals and so on, I'm not sure it will be beneficial for our society if all of us turned into 'functional psychopaths'."
11,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17287039-mrnica,1,"The author is ""that guy"". He has some vague attempts at being self deprecating but just can't hide how much he wants to make love to himself--not in the normal masturbatory way, but in a creepy doppelganger gangbang sort of way.Also, the book reads like an excessively long blog post.The article on this book from Scientific American Mind covers anything you might want to learn without the nausea and the bitter taste of haterade."
12,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is a really unique take on a perhaps taboo subject matter. I though that his information was well presented, interesting, and definitely took a more broad view of the mind and psychosis. Its an enjoyable read and I really enjoyed how he took others views in account such as Steven Pinkers thoughts on violence in society. I would read this again. "
13,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,4,"Actually this is even better than I anticipated, in that the author directly argues his point with some decent supporting evidence. Other books that are trying to make an interesting point (e.g. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking) often don't really go anywhere other than trying to blow your mind with neat and quirky things that studies have found. And what is the author's point? That psychopaths are useful in some areas of society, and that people can do better at some things if they have psychopathic tendencies. He talks a lot more about the Serial Killers and Spies, but he does tie in Saints towards the end.There's a lot of good stuff to learn in here about the current state of psychopath research, including that there are (interview) tests that are pretty good at differentiating psychopaths from regular people, although the DSM IV doesn't differentiate psychopathy from ASD (the author makes a good argument for doing so). Dutton keeps returning to the issue of whether psychopaths feel empathy, where it seems they can under conditions that don't bring out their psychopathic behavior, and in fact they are apparently much better at reading emotional states than regular people.There were a couple of things I wish were elucidated a bit more in book, where they are just kind of dropped like curiosity bombs: that psychopaths don't have the normal ""alert"" brain wave that EEGs read from people (beta waves), and instead have theta waves which normal people have when drowsy or in deep meditation. Also, there's a statement that psychopaths don't procrastinate, which if it's true would be a very good self-indicator. However, there's not much to back up that claim."
14,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5865312-long-nguyen,5,"Written at a very accessible level for a casual reader of psychology, packed with moments of humor and active thinking, and ultimately an enjoyable read. It makes one wonder where on the sliding scale we'd be, or at least I did. The contrast between saints and sinners gets a little blurry as Dutton tries to make the case that in moderate doses, some psychopathic traits are very beneficial to society. I wonder then, if it's at all possible to prevent the negatives while capitalizing on the positives. Of course, this is a bit greedy, to want the cake and eat it too. But the alternative is to not have these traits floating about at all, and that doesn't seem beneficial either (nor is it possible, given reality). An undercurrent topic also surfaces occasionally, the interaction between what is a natural talent and what can be acquired. The author does not seem to address it directly though. The reader is left to judge and go from there, not that it's a bad thing to think on the evidence by one's self."
15,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"If you choose to read this book, I would advise regarding it completely as entertainment. Don’t expect it to reveal too much about the issue of psychopathy—it tells the reader much more about the author than about this mental condition.This is a book to be enjoyed for its anecdotes, not for its scholarship. The author seems to believe that quite a number of psychopaths populate his life—from his father to one of his childhood friends. Plus he tells an entertaining story of his visit to Broadmoor Hospital, where psychopaths are securely housed.Despite the author’s enthusiasm, I’m not sure that we regular folk have anything of any great import to learn from psychopaths. Much more significant in my opinion is the ability of regular folk to recognize these damaged people and deal with or avoid them, something that the author doesn’t even broach. This seems to be more the author as a fan, rather than a realist. Despite this, an entertaining read."
16,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5175325-sumeet-mahendra,4,"Though I've read this book quite fast but I really enjoyed those useful lessons and somehow in mid of it, I started considering myself as a good psychopath. Someone who has total control on fear or any emotion, whatsoever. And, it maybe due to years of mediation & reading spiritual scriptures. The main message in this book is:Some psychopaths end up in jail as tried murderers and rapists, but others are successful executives, lawyers and surgeons and hold high political offices.

Dr. Dutton examines the phenomenon of the psychopathic personality from every angle, positive and negative, and makes the resulting study lively, fascinating, and serious but also often funny. He explores the latest science at the time of writing (2009) seeking explanations of how and why some people are psychopaths, how they think and behave, and even undergoes an experimental procedure with a trancranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine - one I'd love to try too - to have his own brain very temporarily rendered psychopathic, so he can experience and report first-hand on what it's like to live inside such a mind.He also looks at the presence, sometimes merely useful and sometimes absolutely essential, of some but not all of the traits of a psychopath in the people who are the very best in a number of professions and ways of life ranging from politicians and lawyers through law enforcement and special forces personnel to advanced Buddhist monks (something that was unsettling to a Buddhist friend and meditation instructor when I told her about it.) He also examines the question of whether our culture as a whole is becoming more psychopathic (it seems that it is), why, and what implications that has for the future.Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, crime and the law, brain science, and trends in Western society."
18,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12626843-edward-hoornaert,5,"This fascinating book made me think and reevaluate, which is as high a compliment as I can pay. I was originally drawn to it by an interview with the author in the Toronto Globe and Mail. Dr. Dutton said that not all psychopaths are dangerous (which I already knew; many of them were bank traders who drove us to the Great Recession), but he took it further: he stated that in some circumstances, being a psychopath is an advantage. Many psychopaths are extremely successful, as is shown by a study that determined the U.K.'s professions with the greatest percentage of psychopaths: 
   CEO 
   Lawyer 
   Media (TV/Radio) 
   Salesperson 
   Surgeon 
   Journalist 
   Police Officer 
 I realized also that Dutton's description of psychopaths fit the stereotypical hero of romance novels! Reading this book reinforced that thought ... though it also made me pity any woman who thinks that she will be the one who can induce a ruthless, goal oriented, low-empathy psychopath to become all warm and cuddly!All in all, a thought-provoking read."
19,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4308405-sweepea888,5,"Sutton's interest in the subject is somewhat personal; he suspected his own father was a 'path!A few small anecdotes in and he gets to the meat: he interviews a few experts in the field to get their perspective on if, how the traits of a psychopath can actually be.... beneficial if we utilize them in our daily lives. Unlike sociopaths (emotional, prone to outbursts of uncontrolled anger, yadda) psychopaths are described as having emotions, just 'dialed way down'. In fact, contrary to what many people think they not only have empathy they are more than capable of feeling what others do hence their ability to um, spot potential prey and enjoy manipulating them. Dr. Dutton's voice throughout was enjoyable. He maintained a bit of humor and I particularly liked his talk with the esteemed Dr. Robert Hare. Hare created the psychopath checklist (now known as the PCL- R ; or 'revised') which is used by clinicians world wide to diagnose 'paths . He emailed Hare tentatively to 'meet for coffee' and Hare emailed back 'how about drinks in the hotel bar' HA! Scotch with BOB. Good stuff.Also a super interesting bit included Dutton meeting with Andy McNab, a decorated office for MI6 who was captured (and tortured) by Taliban . Mc Nab shared his thoughts on how he (a psychopath, yes, they had him tested with wires/monitors and such and he had zero reaction to deeply upsetting images, etc) thinks and problem solves and how it is different from the average person.In terms of 'effectiveness' Dutton makes an interesting point: They are fearless, have zero concern for personal safety and are not emotionally volatile. These traits (in the right situation) are perfect for soldiers/law enforcement personnel. When your back is to the wall, according to Dutton, you actually *want* a psychopath in your corner as they make quick decisions and do not panic. Another section of the book explored the correlation between 'path behavioral traits and saints as well as monks. Yes, monks! One monk was able to mediate using 'active presence mediation' as he called it. Hooked up to monitors gauging his heart rate he was able to maintain absolute control over his physiological reactions while being subjected to an array of violent images. So, perhaps we can learn some of the 'tunnel vision' and self teach control without the other negative traits a psychopath has?And of course Dutton rounds it all out with a visit to the infamous Broadmoor hospital in England, home of the criminally insane. He met with some cherry picked 'paths and presented them with several hypothetical situations and their responses were incredibly subdued and well, for lack of better phrasing ingenious. His intent was this: they can think outside of the box, in fact they usually do when it comes to approaching a problem or task. Make no mistake; this book is not in defense of psychopaths. Rather it offers more angles on how to view these odd freaks of nature (because really, they're not the norm) and if you're interested in this topic you'll learn new things despite how many books you've read before.His writing is solid and I'll check out his first book as well. "
20,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,3,"Don't be fooled by the title. Although this book does take a look into how convicted and named ""psychopaths"" go about doing what they do, this is really a book about how to get what you want. Psychopaths just seem to not mind overstepping the boundary of the sanctity of human life. Runners up? Why, CEO's, of course. The breakdown covers traits of those who are successful at what they do. PK's are hyper-focused, usually charismatic, and don't let things like morality, being good or nice, get in the way of doing what they want. We all have these traits to a degree, but we all, for the most part, have a boundary which we do not cross. Part of that is avoiding retribution from the law, but for the majority it's about excelling in a field fairness, and justice, with a heavy reliance on real skills and ability. Unfortunately, those leaning towards ""psychopath"" tendencies have no problems pushing the envelope of lying, intimidating, and ultimately bodily harm to others.What's amazing to me is the managing trait of the psycho boss. They rule (lead?) via fear and acting irrational. Clearly, exhibiting these traits show that the manager is not qualified, has blustered their way into a position they shouldn't be, and in no way will offer any value other than motivating workers to look for another job. Yet, there they are. Perhaps even you have had the privilege to work for such a manager."
21,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,3,"What i can sum up from reading this book: Psychopaths possess certain personality traits which few of us have or master, this is advantageous in many circumstances in the complexity of life, and this may bring success in certain profession with proper containment of those traits. But the counterpoint is that some of the traits are not inherently psychopathic and we can practice them with examples not from psychopaths but those trustworthy, compassionate as well. If you want to better yourselves, go for the traits, do not take the thankless job of seeing psychopaths are prime models. The book is also repetitive at times and could have been more concise, to the point presentation of facts and findings. "

You’ll find them in any organization where your position and status afford you power and control over others, and the chance of material gain.”His coauthor on the corporate psychopathy paper, New York industrial and organizational psychologist Paul Babiak, agrees.“The psychopath has no difficulty dealing with the consequences of rapid change. In fact, he or she thrives on it,” he explains. “Organizational chaos provides both the necessary stimulation for psychopathic thrill seeking and sufficient cover for psychopathic manipulation and abusive behavior.”Ironically, the rule-bending, risk-taking, thrill-seeking individuals who were responsible for tipping the world economy over the edge are precisely the same personalities who will come to the fore in the wreckage. Just like Frank Abagnale, they are the mice who fall into the cream, fight and fight, and churn that cream into butter.***The word “psychopath” carries with it certain unavoidable connotations: images of famous serial killers, like Ted Bundy or Henry Lee Lucas and the almost mythic stories surrounding their individual reigns of terror; thoughts of men and women filled with uncontrollable, malevolent thoughts, in many cases acting on them to the harm and detriment of others. More and more, however, the term is finding application in more readily acceptable spheres—politics and the financial markets, to name a couple of quick and obvious examples, where making a killing, as nefarious as it sounds, is a far more benign proposition than its literal alternative. Even more interesting are the misnomers surrounding genuine psychopathy and what it truly means to be psychotic—and what such personality traits mean for the probability of success.In his new book, The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success, University of Cambridge professor of social psychology Dr. Kevin Dutton deep dives the psychopathic mind in order to strip away some of the more notorious preconceptions that have dogged psychopaths for generations, and in the process to offer a better understanding of their particular, often feared psychologies. There’s an adaptive nature to psychopaths not accurately shown in most public portrayals. It isn’t rooted in amorality or malicious intent, but in an emotional fearlessness that, when balanced with an awareness of social expectations and/or knowledge or passion towards socially acceptable ventures or professions, gives psychopaths a noticeable leg-up. On the outside this can be represented by an unconventionally high degree of personal magnetism, or confidence, or the ability to disguise oneself—to play to the crowd, so to speak, no matter the attributes of said crowd; or maybe it reveals itself as uncanny business acumen, or willingness to go into battle regardless of whether or not the odds of survival are low. The point Dutton makes is that contrary to popular belief, there are uses—indeed necessities—for a mind more prone to stereotypically psychopathic traits, especially when presented with situations where emotional vulnerabilities are potentially grave liabilities.The portraits of psychopaths Dutton paints are not the Patrick Bateman/Hannibal Lecture-style geniuses whose penchant for murder is well hidden beneath their business and academic minds. Those certainly exist and should be feared; however, most cases of psychopathy can be presented, as strange as this might sound, as being of exquisitely analytical and sound mind:“Language, for psychopaths, is only word deep. There’s no emotional contouring behind it. A psychopath may say something like ‘I love you,’ but in reality, it means about as much to him as if he said ‘I’ll have a cup of coffee.’… This is one of the reasons why psychopaths remain so cool, calm, and collected under conditions of extreme danger, and why they are so reward-driven and take risks. Their brains, quite literally, are less ‘switched on’ than the rest of ours.”Because of this, a psychopathic mind (providing it does not sway too far to one extreme or the other) can be expertly employed in situations requiring planning or some sort of conflict resolution.So what can psychopaths teach us? That, for the most part, our problems—our fears and apprehensions that cripple us daily, or cause us to procrastinate and not live our lives to the potential we so desperately want to believe is inside each of us—are problems of the heart, and that it is how we are tuned to our emotions, and the degree to which they dominate our doubts, that exemplifies our collective weaknesses. Does this mean a balanced, socially integrated functional psychopath has an advantage over the average man, woman, and hopefully non-psychopathic child? It depends on the situation: when playing the stock market, most assuredly, as one cannot ever let one’s emotions be rattled by a loss—therein lies financial death and a quick shuttling to the side for this guy over here with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a willingness to take a beating one day and come back swinging hard the next; but when, say, teaching a class in an elementary or high school setting, not likely, as the inability to sync with individuals who are by and large emotional lightning rods could be potentially exhausting for all parties involved.A psychopath is not necessarily a killer, or a heartless machine capable of only taking advantage of others, as we’re so frequently instructed to believe (given the rampant overuse and abuse of the term). That stereotype exists for a reason, as it is sometimes accurate; but, as with all points on the psychological spectrum, there are an infinite number of shades of grey that can be used to better define psychopathy to individual standards. Dutton’s examination goes a fair distance in disproving the concreteness of the stereotype, while opening the conversation to new possibilities as to how we see our business and political leaders, and even our more successful surgeons, spies, and military personnel. These professions, and many others, cater to a certain degree of psychopathy, which can often be mistaken for simply luck or confidence, but is in fact a much more complicated matter, one contained within the physiology of a surprisingly large amount of the population."
24,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13820728-romina-claudia,3,"An interesting popscy read, although in my opinion it lacks a basic storyline. U read about a tibetan monk then about a truck driver, then about a soldier, then about a dinner with a specialist; the positive outcomes of being a psychopath are mixed with the negative ones, not following a specific logic. Or maybe I’ve just missed it. The accuracy of the information is debatable, as in most books of this type. The title is a click bite though. However, there are a lot of interesting information and it does give you something to reflect on. The amount of work the author put into the research is remarkable, as well as his passion for the subject. "
25,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75267716-owen-townend,3,"While I am fascinated by the mental make-up of the psychopath, I am no proponent of the idea that psychopaths are cooler than everyone else. Dutton labours under that assumption for a good portion of this book. This bias could be forgivable if it weren't for his writing style.The Wisdom of Psychopaths is an informative exploration of the topic but it is inconsistent. The book starts with some very dry passages focusing on neurological and psychological studies and their findings, only to then swap to a gonzo journalistic style which I will admit was infinitely more preferable. What is not to like about a chapter where Dutton meets with military thriller novelist Andy McNab to undergo a procedure testing for psychopathic reaction? Indeed I learned more about McNab in a matter of pages than I ever have from reading his writing. It was genuinely stimulating facts like this that stuck in my mind, certainly not variations of the Trolley Problem and how certain brains respond to it. Having read Jon Ronson's superior book The Psychopath Test, I'm afraid The Wisdom of Psychopaths doesn't quite measure up. It was much too easy to break away from reading this which feels wrong considering the subject matter. You expect a book about psychopathology to be all engrossing, you expect to only ever break away because turning the page has become too disconcerting. You don't expect to break away because you're bored.Nevertheless, stylistic disappointment aside, I did learn a lot about psychopaths and even came to appreciate how their single-minded purpose can bear positive results. I just feel I could have absorbed so much more had these facts been strung together with a more dependable voice. Regardless I recommend The Wisdom of Psychopaths to those with a passion for all things neurally atypical."
26,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,5,I thought that this book was good 
27,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46002774-amber,0,"DNFI couldn’t get into it. I found it so boring despite the appealing premise. It was repetitive as well, and didn’t get to any tangible point. I won’t be finishing it. "
28,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10035473-john-cooper,1,"The author begins his book by explaining that his own father was a psychopath. On what evidence? It seems that while he was driven to succeed, he was undeterred by failure, and his spirits never sank. If this seems like unsupported reasoning to you, you may find the rest of the book irritating as well. The author consistently uses the two techniques illustrated by his introduction: label anyone who strongly exhibits any trait among the many associated with sociopathic personality disorder as a ""psychopath""; and burden every page with sensationalism until it groans. So the early sections of the book explain to us that many surgeons, who are masters of cold precision at the operating table, are psychopaths. Special Forces members, who love danger and seem fearless, are psychopaths. Anyone who succeeds at the difficult and often merciless decisions associated with growing a business is probably a psychopath.How much more interesting this book would have been if the author had identified himself as a psychopath. I don't know whether he is, although I suspect he could be fit into his own loose definition. Unfortunately, he chooses to present himself as one of the inferior majority, doomed to approaching life with all the usual fears and hesitations. The section where he visits Broadmoor Prison, where universally acknowledged psychopaths are housed, should have been one of the strongest parts of the book, providing a little insight into the mindsets of the most remorseless killers. Instead, the visit is milked for every drop of amateur dramatics, as he describes himself quaking with fear as he gazes into the predator's steely eyes, and so on ad nauseum. It's as clumsy and shallow as a high-schooler's field trip report.If you can wade through all the crap (the ability to do so being a psychopathic trait), there is value to be had here, particularly in the research studies cited, which you are of course free to Google and learn more about, if your curiosity hasn't been dampened by the predictable and repetitive claims that ""what they found was astounding."" The raw material that remains visible suggests what a good book about this subject might have been like. "
29,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19069281-tirath,5,"The brilliant thing about psychopaths is that they are quite rational, and sometimes, too rational.Fear is useless because it is based on potential outcomes, many of which may not happen and have definitely not happened in real life (right now).The brain goes into a fast forward mode - and you lose sight of the present.What if you were asleep? Then, you wouldn't be scared would you?Shouldn't one unknown life be less valuable than 4 unknown lives? If yes, then push.Psychopaths are amazing at understanding others, but not at empathising with them; disconnect between knowing what an emotion is and what it feels like.Is the larger, general society becoming more psychopathic, with its diregard for others - prevalent everywhere?What's the point of showing emotion when it's not going to make any difference?Best part (Pg 182):""What's worse, from a moral perspective? Beating someone up who deserves it? Or beating yourself up who doesn't?""Why do people tolerate ruthlessness in sport but not in everyday life? Whats the difference?The problem with a lot of people is that what they think is a virtue is actually a vice in disguise.People get too caught up in the heat of the moment, based on their perception of others perception of them - and temporarily go off track. Now, this makes people lose sight of what they want, and make 'winning' the goal.- Wonder how psychopathic behaviour shows itself between genders? Are men more prone to be psychopaths?- And the effect of culture and society - do close knit societies and communities spawn fewer psychopaths (Asia?)- Thought provoking book throughout"
30,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"I struggle to give this a 5 star but would rank it higher than a 4. The discussions were quite insightful and the analysis of the Frog and Scorpion were used 2 days after explaining the book to an individual. For what it teaches us about success is also very interesting. Thinking of heads of various companies, I can see how the single track focused mindset with blinders to everything else can propel a company to the top. Yes, those companies probably have bodies along the way but those executives are oblivious to them. The discussion of spies is one I had not considered as a psychopath study but can now totally see how that is the right recruitment process. No emotion & no empathy can be the winning combination needed to obtain a 007 type status. Saint discussion, eh. Maybe why this is a 4 star vs. 5. I presented that to a PHD religion student friend on FB and he mentioned that was a stretch. Maybe the individual in the book was not the best reference, maybe he was full of himself, but not sure a Saint would be defined as someone without emotion or empathy. (<-- My opinion).All in all though a good book that does teach you about good and bad traits. If you listen closely, there really is some good advice. "
31,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079638-fortinbras79,4,"This book reads as if it were written by a relatively young, tenured Oxford professor of psychology...which it is. It has a permeating egotism throughout the writing and the air of superiority comes through in numerous ways.That being said, if you can get past the dripping meliority, the book is actually quite good.Kevin Dutton analyzes the brains and behaviours of some of the world's leaders in industry and finance as well as some of the most brutal killers. Decorated soldiers, investment bankers, lawyers, and criminals are all observed and given tests and all, as it turns out, have something in common...they are all psychopathic. Or at least, rate highly on the psychopathy scale.There are a number of ways to read this book, as there is any book, but I took it almost as a tutorial in how to excel in business.Definitely worth the read.“Deep inside me there’s a serial killer lurking somewhere. But I keep him amused with cocaine, Formula One, booty calls, and coruscating cross-examination.” Doesn't get five stars simply because he's such a pompous twat. "
32,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,2,"I was going to say this could have been so much better, but really, with the premise presented, I don't know that there was much to salvage. It's filled with anecdotes, cleverness, sketchy psuedo-science and even sketchier advice. Martha Stout, whose review appeared in New Republic, sums it up best I think:""Dutton’s real argument seems to be that sometimes we could all use a little of what he terms “the seven deadly wins”—ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. Yes, I daresay we could—but those behavioral features do not represent a “dose of psychopathy,” to use Dutton’s expression."" I wish I'd read that review before reading the book. "

Dutton uses some excellent case examples, and everything, even if it seem irrelevant, has a very interesting point regarding the nature of psychopaths. However, it did feel a bit jumbled, as if a string of blog posts had been compiled into a book, with no real consideration for the series of points. This somewhat undermined the point of having themed chapters. I think some theories were outdated, and a little inaccurate, however I'm reading this years after publication, and research has changed dramatically since; as has the society that Dutton comments on in which these psychopaths roam. However, this is not negatively reflected in my rating, as the contents of the book must have been highly relevant at the time of its initial publication.On the whole, a good book for anyone wanting a broad overview of psychopathic tendencies and individuals, without being too overly complicated, or biology based."
34,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7529357-simone,1,"In the preface, Dutton remembers with pride and admiration his father, the amazing salesman who once sold a whole load of datebooks that only had eleven months instead of twelve: ""Unique opportunity to get your hands on an eleven-month diary, folks ... sign up for a special two-for-one offer and get an extra month thrown in next year for free""..But this is nothing compared to what Kevin Dutton is doing: selling an useless book, by suggesting that it can make readers more successful. ""What saints, spies and serial killers can TEACH US about SUCCESS"". ""You could probably benefit from being a little more psychopathic yourself""... Yeah, right. As if someone could deliberately chose to become a bit more psychopathic in order to become more successful.At this point, the writer has already lost all credibility. I started asking myself: is this guy writing out of passion, or maybe because he genuinely believes he is writing something useful, or just because he wants to make money and become famous?After reading the preface, the purpose of the writer seemed already obvious to me.""Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless, and focused."" then ""there are times when it’s actually a good thing when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people"". Indeed, ""a number of psychopathic traits were more prevalent among business leaders than among diagnosed criminal psychopaths"".This is the main idea, and it is repeated over and over in the book, in case readers did not get it by reading the book cover.""The wisdom of psychopaths"" is actually mildly entertaining, but also very repetitive, verbose, pretentious, and biased as it is promoting the writers point of view and his work (""I know, because I’ve tested them""). Sometimes it looks like the writer is just showing off (""I have cradled John Wayne Gacy’s brain in my hands"") - the guy seems quite full of himself.What this book really teaches us is that anyone can sell anything by using some shameless marketing techniques. How?1) find a title that sounds brilliant, witty, eye-catching, odd, contrary to popular belief and distant from what we know from common sense (something like: ""the wisdom of psychopats"" or maybe ""the joy of suicide"" or why not, ""the pleasure of depression""). People will think ""oh really? I never thought of it, how can it be? I'm curious to know more"". The subject will be perfect for small talk during coffee break in offices: ""did you know that psychopats have a unique set of skills?"" ""let's find our if our boss is a psychopath"". Someone might even buy the book (I'm so glad I didn't).2) suggest the idea that readers will be able to become more successful after reading the book.It's not true, but it does not matter, since most readers will find out after buying the book, not before.3) include some interviews to top managers, top lawyers, top movie stars, top secret agents, top serial killers, basically anyone who is TOP, VIP, glamourous and trendy. If you don't have much time, just make up the interviews, pretending they wanted to stay anonymous: it's a lot faster and nobody will ever know.4) search the scientific literature, you can always find a few studies that seem to support your bizarre theory. Like the study about collecting sweat from the armpits of first-time skydivers and waving it under the noses of a second bunch of volunteers, to see if they can smell fear in the sweat. A bit bizarre indeed. But it must be true and reliable because the writer says so.5) work with top marketing experts to advertise the book on the mediaThen you should become a top writer and maybe someday someone will interview you as an example to prove his bizarre theories about successful writers."

""...the emergence of neurolaw...the increasingly greater interest the courts are now taking in cutting edge neuroscience. The watershed study was published in 2002, and found that a functional polymorphism in a neurotransmitter metabolizing gene predicts psychopathic behavior in men who were mistreated as children.

36,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954583-chloe-nickel,1,"Dutton doesn’t ever seem to offer a clear and accurate definition of what psychopathy is. He confuses mental discipline and the ability to regulate emotions in order to make quick decisions under pressure with indifference to consequences and lack of emotion. He diagnoses people and fictional characters as psychopathic and “functionally” psychopathic even though (as far as I can tell) he has no training which allows him to do so (and also for many of them does this based on his own opinions, rather than the accepted method to do so) in order to further his point that we should aspire to be like “functional” psychopaths in order to succeed. Do I think it can be helpful in getting ahead and being successful to be more mindful of our emotions, control our emotions under pressure, take risks, and to think of ourselves before other? Yeah. Are these things inherently psychopathic traits? Absolutely not, and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous to equate these traits as just “milder” versions of psychopathic traits.Other issues that I have: -The use of neurodiversity as adjectives (“bipolar,” “schizophrenic,” and “autistic” as adjectives)-The over-sensationalism of many of the anecdotes-Dutton thinks he’s wittier than he is and insists on inserting himself into stories, even where it’s unnecessary and detracts from the point"
37,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"Interesting, technical and yet entertaining book that mainly focuses on the functional psychopath. What surprised me, was, that it was somewhat unscientific, i.e. a bit too anecdotal considering it was written by Dutton, a researcher at Oxford.I was a bit disappointed that the seriousness of the condition of psychopathy which has no cure is minimized in this book. Because no matter how successful a functional psychopath may be, even if they're not damaging to society, and may often perform much needed tasks, he/she cannot be wise, for there is an emptiness in them that will lead them to wreak havoc (psychological). This may not be illegal, and will certainly not land them in jail, yet it does have a lasting and damaging impact for those that are forced to deal with them on a day to day basis.It might well be a thoroughly researched book, but it was too sensationalist for my liking."

How our interpretation of the word 'psychopath' has a negative connotation (aka - serial killers) which limits the possibility of reaping the positive points we can learn from functional psychopaths.In short, Dutton describes how the qualities that certain professions need in order to succeed (politicians, CEOS, surgeons) are similar to those shared by some of the most wicked. These traits are as follows; fearlessness, mental toughness, charm, ruthlessness, focus and mindfulness.A really interesting read with great case studies. It may be a bit technical for the average reader at times but definitely fascinating. (Also, permanent addition to my office bookshelf)4.39 / 5"

They can teach us how to keep a cool head in tough situations, about taking rejection well, about putting everything in and not being afraid to lose it. I mean, those are good traits, and I agree with the statement that there are functional psychopaths rather than them all just turning out to be serial killers."

Things we didn’t learn how to do - leverage the decision making power of psychopaths to enhance our lives. The book title is a lie. Too many recaps on research studies. Interesting things I wish were discussed more - will society decide to weed out psychopaths with DNA testing and genome mapping? Will we use gene therapy to “fix” babies who show psychopathic tendencies? Can criminals claim their psychopathic genes made crime inevitable and receive lesser sentences?"

How we use these traits are a definitive aspect of our personality. Dr. Kevin Dutton write about how many people of power have the same traits as many career criminals. The idea is that their endgame is the same, but how they carry themselves and get to that point is what truly differentiates a psychopathic inmate from a successful CEO.The way I learned to think of these traits is by imagining it as a switchboard. We have ability to either flip the switch on or off depending on the situation and Dr. Dutton discusses that immensely in this book. He also uses image of a mixing board to describe psychopathic traits. He explains it as psychopathy being turned up louder than other traits, such as empathy. By using this description, he allows us to see psychopathy in a new way, one that shows how these traits can be beneficial in some careers. Overall, this was an incredibly interesting read. Huge shout out to my friend Tommy for loaning me his copy of The Wisdom of Psychopaths!This review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!"
45,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay,4,"Psychology fascinates me, particularly the “abnormal” variety. This book is packed with tons of interesting information about psychopaths and the author, with a psychopathic family member, is an expert on the subject. There are tons of gems to be mined as the author conducts his quest to understand psychopathy. Some of the nuggets of note are that not all psychopathy is maladaptive. Having a brain surgeon, for example, who is a psychopath is actually beneficial. They need to make cold, calculated, and quick decisions. As I always suspected, corporate culture is a hotbed of psychopathy, and CEOs in general tend to score high on the psychopathy scale. The author makes a case that the concept of psychopaths having low empathy being a myth. He asserts that psychopaths with high intelligence and high history of violence have plenty of empathy. In fact, they achieve satisfaction in understanding their victims pain. Throughout the book, psychopathy isn’t always shown as a negative. Psychopaths have a unique ability to strive, overcome, and succeed by responding rather than reacting. The core principles of psychopathy: ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action can be harnessed with the right balance into “seven daily wins.” I was a disappointed that this topic was not explored in more depth. I experienced the audiobook version and really liked the narration. I’d rate this book as a three and a half star read, rounded up to four. "

It seems that there is an actual NEED for them in some jobs—neurosurgeon, undercover officer, fighter pilot. There are links to various studies to determine a persons placement test on an index that ranks the potential. There are also offers of situations that challenge just what a non-psychopath might do.  “There’s a story making the rounds n the internet and it goes like this. While attending her mothers funeral, a woman meets a man she’s never seen before. She thinks he’s incredible. She believed him to be her soul mate... But she never asks for his number and, when the funeral is over, cannot track him down. A few da s later she kills her sister. Why? Assuming you think like a psychopath, the answer is this: because she was hoping the man would turn up again at her sisters funeral.”Chilling. "

They are among us in every structure in our life. They are not necessarily evil, but pragmatic and obsessive with accomplishing a task or a desire. Probably the amygdala (responsible for the emotions) is not so well developed in these individuals, but that gives them the advance in taking taught decisions in crucial situations. The author manages to give a lot of examples from historical figures to films and literature. A big part of the book is supported by medical and scientific researches, I especially enjoyed the experiment with electricity, people are almost able setting the brain to another individual to a close version of the Psychopaths brain.

51,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,2,"Kevin Dutton's ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" would have made for a terrific Rolling Stone article. It presents a fun thesis - that being a psychopath, at least in moderation, can be useful; it's full of cheeky, colorful language (""if there's one thing psychopaths have in common, it's the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal, everyday folk, while behind the facade - the brutal, brilliant disguise - beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator""); and it does a decent job of interweaving interviews with research and commentary. Unfortunately, it does not make for a terrific book. ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" tries to stretch 20 pages of interesting content across 200 pages of paper, and the end result is a diluted book that makes for an easy but ultimately unsatisfying read.First, it's worth mentioning that Dutton's definition of psychopathy differs from the official line set forth by the American Psychiatric Association. The DSM defines psychopathy as synonymous with ""Antisocial Personality Disorder,"" which is defined as ""a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the right of others."" (51) Dutton and many of his colleagues argue that this definition overemphasizes social deviance and ignores the ""core affective impairment, the shadowy emotional twilight, redolent of the psychopath."" (52) Psychopaths aren't necessarily deviant or violent - rather, they're distinguished by a total lack of empathy, and curiously, a complete absence of anxiety. They're characterized by a ""grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others."" (9) The recipe for a killer? Sometimes - but Dutton will argue that there are more psychopaths in the workforce than there are locked up bars.Like any other psychological ""condition"", psychopathy lies on a spectrum, and of course you can be ruthless, manipulative, and free of compunction without being a killer. Indeed, in many professions, psychopathic traits can be a boon. For instance, if you're a surgeon, businessmen, spy, trader, or soldiers, you're likely to find yourself professionally advantaged if some of you psychopathic knobs are cranked a bit higher than normal. High-powered business executives in particular tend to score high on the psychopathy scale: one study found that ""a number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals."" (21)Dutton's central thesis, then, is essentially that being a psychopath ""can be good for us, at least in moderation."" (xvii) He's certainly qualified to make such a claim: Dutton is research psychologist from Oxford, and it's clear he's done his research here, both as a professor and as a journalist. Some of the studies he cites are really interesting: for instance, you'll learn that psychopaths can detect people with a history of trauma after watching a 10 second clip of said person walking, or that, unlike most people, psychopaths have no emotional response (as indicated by physiological signals) to words like ""cancer"" or ""rape."" These studies serve to describe the psychopathic persona, and they constitute the highlights of the book.Unfortunately, the studies are sparse and often feel disconnected from the rest of the book, as they're flanked by a glut of over-narrated interviews and forays into territories the author doesn't much understand, or at least doesn't have the time to develop (evolutionary biology, game theory, and epigenetics, to name a few). The topics can get pretty random. For instance, there's a chapter that examines similarities between psychopathy and religion, which I actually rather enjoyed - the author makes a rather compelling case that the biblical figure of Paul is as psychopathic as they get. The book concludes by arguing (stating?) that psychopathic traits are useful in certain contexts, and that it's the ability to turn them on and off that makes for a functional psychopath. I'm inclined to agree - though I think almost everybody would, so this point makes for a pretty underwhelming conclusion.In sum, ""The Wisdom of the Psychopaths"" is a mixed bag. It's often interesting, mostly thanks to its subject matter, and it makes for a pleasant read, due to the author's jazzy, flamboyant writing style. Unfortunately, it's light on substance and lacking in structure - so while this might be an interesting book, it's not really a good one. If you're stoked on psychopaths, this is probably the most entertaining-yet-accurate resource out there. If not - well, just wait for the Rolling Stones article to come out.Interesting factsThe empathy scores of college kids have dropped 40% in past 3 decades.Psychopaths are less helpful when directly asked for help, but are more likely to volunteer help when they observe someone in need (say what!?)Most psychopaths are non-violent, and most violent psychopaths were sexually abused and otherwise mistreated when children."

Besides that, it could have been more organised (he sometimes drops some theories without presenting a conclusion regarding to that theories). "
56,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The basic premise of The Wisdom of Psychopaths, by Kevin Dutton, a British psychologist and writer, specializing in the study of psychopathy, is that psychopathic traits may actually be desirable in some situations. For example, the primary characteristic of psychopaths is that they have shallow emotions and a lack of empathy. Normally those aren’t considered beneficial personality characteristics, but what if you were a pediatric surgeon? Most people would be squeamish about taking a knife to a small child. A surgeon capable of suppressing these feelings and performing an operation in a cool and collected fashion would likely be a better at their job than one who let their emotions interfere with their work. So – before we examine this claim, a little background is in order. First, while the concept of psychopathy has been around for some time, it isn’t recognized as an official psychiatric disorder (you won’t find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders i.e. the DSM). It’s really an informal term used to describe people with an extreme form of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) who possess the following traits:•	Lack of empathy, guilt, conscience or remorse•	Shallow experiences of feelings or emotions•	Impulsivity and a weak ability to defer gratification and control behavior•	Superficial charm and glibness•	Irresponsibility and a failure to accept responsibility for their actions•	A grandiose sense of their own worthTo many, the word ‘psychopath’ calls to mind the image of a cold-blooded serial killer who first charms their victim before bludgeoning them to death, dismembering their corpse and eating their liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. The reality is somewhat different given that that psychopathy exists on a spectrum. The charming con-man, the cool and collected secret agent, the ruthless negotiator and the 45th president of the U.S. are also faces of psychopathy. And while a significant portion of criminals are psychopaths, those who are psychopaths are not necessarily criminals. Psychopaths make up as much as 25 percent of male offenders in prison, but only about 1 percent of the general population. Those who are not criminals can lead normal successful lives. In fact, it is estimated that 21 percent of CEOs are psychopaths (an occupation where ruthlessness can be an asset). As for The Wisdom of Psychopaths, the book is at its best when describing studies that have been performed that examine various aspects of psychopathy. Dutton himself works in the field and as such is familiar with much of the relevant research. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two significant flaws, one of which is found in the title itself.First – Dutton explains psychopathy and its prevalence within a population in terms of evolutionary psychology. In case you’re unfamiliar with the term Wiki defines it thus: Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. The problem with this approach is that Dutton doesn’t provide any evidence that psychopathy evolved as a result of it providing a survival advantage. That’s because such evidence doesn’t exist. Unlike say, larger teeth, longer legs or bigger eye sockets, the brain leaves no fossil evidence behind (let alone fossil evidence indicative of psychopathy). While Dutton’s facile explanations possess a veneer of plausibility, in the absence of supporting evidence his explanation devolves into another Just-So story. Second – Even if certain psychopathic traits were desirable (and if you value your personal relationships, they’re not), there’s nothing that they can “teach us about success” because that would involve changing who you are as a person. No amount of brainwashing, psychological manipulation or behavioral therapy can turn someone into a psychopath who wasn't one to begin with. In fact, it isn’t necessary either. A squeamish pediatric surgeon doesn’t need to become a psychopath to become better at his job. That’s because we can learn to become desensitized to certain stimuli with time and repeated exposure. Finally, there’s a reason the term ‘psychopath’ has negative connotations. Psychopathy is considered a 'mental disorder' which the DSM defines as: “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” A mental disorder, by definition, isn’t beneficial to the sufferer and I daresay, it isn’t a surefire path to success."
57,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13200679-dushyant-chaturvedi,4,"What psychological attributes make up a psychopath? Can we measure the degree of such attributes? Is the presence of such factors helpful in daily life? What are the professions that see highest percentages of people classified as psychopaths? What are the similarities between notorious psychopaths, world famous spies and monks?These and many other similar fascinating questions are tackled head on and answered by Prof Dutton in this intriguing book. The examples and the social experiments that are described are most ingenious and are sure to blow you away.There is some repetition in the second half of the book. But, it is quite brilliant read and ends up championing the unlikely cause that it takes up in the beginning- that of proving how psychopathy is prevalent and useful.Highly recommended."
58,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6496964-onyx,5,"Dictionary.com says the words sociopath and psychopath mean the same thing. Other random books and websites speak of them as different. Apparently what people in many parts of the the United States call ""sociopath"" is what in many parts of Britain call ""psychopath."" And finally, let's not forget the DSM, which just calls it ""psychopath"" and expects to have the last word in. (Actually, from what I think the book says, the DSM has a problem has a problem accepting the very word as a official term because it's too subjective.) The author, Dr. Kevin Dutton, whom I suppose is British, has decided to name his book, ""The Wisdom of Psychopaths"" while I kind of wish he named it ""The Wisdom of Sociopaths"" instead, but that's just my personal preference. Since he wrote the book, I'll use his term to minimize confusion as much as possible. With that said and out of the way, and from what some comments I've read, I got the impression that you'll probably either love the book or hate it. I love it. I also take it that this book was written after the movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" came out, which would make sense to me even if I never saw the movie. It would be the right time to put it on the map for the widest possible audience to read. In spite of it riding on the coattails of the movie, this was a good book. It made me think...so much so that a good quarter of the world that was so much of a frustrating mystery suddenly made sense...like in ""Why, after all these millennia of attempts of trying to make the world a better place, are things still the same as it ever was?...Oh, I got it now!"" I don't usually read books from publishers like Scientific American because science is usually dry, boring, technical, and has its own language going on that sounds like it came from other planets. As it stands, it was distracting that the author was making reference after reference of this person or that coming from the college of this or the university of that...as if I cared...let's get on with the story. Luckily for him, his writing has a sense of humor when I usually don't see British humor as funny. I actually laughed out loud at some points. A person might ask how I could find so funny such a frighting and horrendous subject, to which I would reply that he's particularly good at gallows humor and sarcasm, and not just illumination. It's possible to be in a situation that's incredibly bad and yet is so funny that you can't quit laughing because of how it was happening and not just what. Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies on TV when I was a teenager. Some might be unbelievably surprised that Dutton would count among his categories of psychopaths such people as doctors, lawyers, military elites, politicians...and biblical characters, saints, and Buddhist monks and martial artists. I don't know about the last two, but I know enough about the Bible and Christianity to recognize psychopathic characteristics in a person like Paul the Apostle. It also readily explains where all that self-discipline comes from...it wasn't just from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. He brought all that in with him when he converted...only just leaving the physical violence behind. And he assumed and advocated that what he could do, anyone could do if they trusted in the Lord...as if everyone is capable of being as psycho as he was. Fast forward a couple of thousand years, however, experiments showed that psychopaths' brainwaves showed levels consistent to what one would normally anticipate from those whose entire lives were spent in meditation. If you're constantly meditating, especially in so-called ""mindfulness meditation,"" apparently not much bothers you. The author implies that one of the ""wisdoms"" of being more like a high-functioning psychopath happens to be mindful meditation. I can totally see that.Dr. Dutton makes being a psychopath look appealing...so appealing that you might be looking around asking yourself, ""Wow, am I a psychopath? I really hope so. If I'm not, I want to be one!"" I'm clearly not a psychopath, but I'm sure I wasn't born an empath, either. I have emotions, but trying to figure them out is a different story...they live on a sliding scale. Yet the author writes as if he admires the different types of psychopaths he has talked to and discussed with others. That's been a complaint of a number of different commentators...especially women...that he didn't write nearly enough about the dark side of being a psychopath (yes, he wrote mainly about males, as supposedly there's not enough information about female psychopaths). He's so enamored by them that he decided to have his mind messed with so that he can know how it feels to be a psychopath for under a half hour (apparently it's like being on something where you completely let go of everything but the present moment...and enjoy it). To me, this isn't no ordinary psychologist. Any person who has his picture taken in a pinstripe suit and a purple shirt and pocket hankie in the jacket pocket, styling like a 1920's gangster, and places it in the back inside jacket cover of his book, is no ordinary psychologist, British or otherwise. :-) I doubt he can hide his interest behind his geek-psychologist glasses. He may not be a true psychopath himself, but he just might have it in him somewhere deep down inside anyway. After all, he is a psychologist, right?If Dr. Dutton does write another book, I hope he can find some evidence on the existence on empaths...especially on those that don't fit the stereotype of what a empath is supposed to be like. There are such things as dark empaths...ones who use their empathy to abuse others. As a matter of opinion, a lot of what the good doctor lumps into the group ""psychopath"" seems to be those who could span a whole gambit of personalities, not just the calm, cool, collected ones. Some empaths, for example, can render themselves so detached from the emotions they feel, that their ability to read emotions on an intimate level can cause them to be a different kind of destructive than the psychopath...just as charming, just as manipulative, yet a different style of dominion. But that might be sailing in more subjective waters, and we don't really want to do that, now do we? Already, psychology spends way too much time on ""fixing disorders"" and not enough time on natural attributes. A good example is this...psychopathology. If you can't cure this problem, what if it's not really a problem? What if it's natural? What if we're trying to make a person over into what he (or she) is not and forcing them to fit into a society that needs much more fixing than the psychopath does? According to this book, there are ""high-functioning"" psychopaths out there. What if we're being sore hypocrites and forcing people to conform into something that they're not meant to be, instead of catching them early and finding out how to actually train them to be something other than being even more destructive? This doesn't just go for labeled psychopaths. This just about goes for anyone who didn't just throw themselves out of third-story windows and go crashing to the ground, messing up their bodies and minds in the process. Instead of labeling people mentally ill, maybe we should take a good look at our already dysfunctional society and ask ourselves, ""What is in our societies that is considered normal?"" Because the way it looks, there seems to be a narrow acceptance of what is normal and what is not...as opposed to what is natural and what is not. The first sentence I remember beginning psychology textbooks used to ask was, ""What is abnormal?"" I don't know if they ask that question anymore. I hope that's not such a revolutionary idea that it's refused a consideration. Otherwise, the good little boy will continue to be the one who is obedient, rather than then the one who's a genius. And society will continue to function as a heavily-regulated system of duties, requirements, responsibilities, and obligations. Such a system of expectations will have its loopholes that those like psychopaths will be able to spot, and they will continue to use them to the sheeple's detriment. Or they'll just crash the system period, because they don't have much patience for delays. So what do we want, a naturally healthy society, or an artificial dysfunctional one?"
59,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy,4,"I enjoyed this book very much. After reading it, I am convinced that close to 25% of my friends are psychopaths. ;) None of my friends on Goodreads, of course. Soooo...thank goodness all of my friends on Goodreads are ""saints"". It helps bring balance to my life. ;) I like that this book contains scenarios & questions for you to present to someone you might think is a sociopath. I definitely picked up a question or two to ask potential boyfriends.Asking how they would react to the 2 different train scenarios described in this book are now my go to questions.Their response to the second scenario is not only showing you who they are, it's them telling you who they are. As Maya Angelou says, ""The first time someone shows you who they are...believe them.""This book contains the most comprehensive list of characteristics/traits of sociopaths I've ever read including the following:They lack of empathy, guilt & remorse. They're glib, pathological, manipulative, charming, & nomadic. They feed off of a person's hope that next time things will be different or that they will do the right thing in the future. They use your hope to manipulate you into giving them second, third, fourth, fifth chances. They seek out ""rescuers"" & overly loyal people.They often abuse drugs and/or alcohol.They constantly lie & exaggerate.They cheat in relationships, in fact that's often how they find their next mark when they begin to sense they are losing control over you.They make lots of promises but rarely is there positive action towards keeping the promise. Promises are just cons to get what they want at that moment and they don't care if they let you down later. They're not good at holding a job, often seeking out public assistance or conning someone for money and/or shelter. They have no direction & no personal initiative to make positive changes in their life.If caught in a lie, they will try to manipulate out of it first, and then blame others. It is always someone else's fault. No matter what it is, how clearly it is the predator's fault, they cannot take the blame; unless it is part of the manipulation that goes: admit/apologize/pity play/forgiven/make up.They seem driven by convenience, access to sex, and financial interest, or using partner or kids as tools to manipulate others. There are frequent cycles of chaos, calm, chaos, calm, in relationships.They manipulate and pit people against each other by creating chaos and pointing fingers at those who bring up the problem. Their goal is to get everyone so confused and upset no one can even remember the predator is the root of the problem.This book points out a few scenarios in which it's good to have sociopaths around. For example,life or death situations that require quick decisions be made without emotions that would impact the decisions. One example is surgeons having to make life saving decisions during surgeries. It's easier to make the decision quicker if the surgeon is not emotionally affected by knowing the patient will die if the wrong decision is made. This book & other books I've read on the subject all agree that sociopaths can not be cured. Like my daddy always says ""You can't fix broken people, you're just gonna cut yourself on their shattered pieces."""

Two kinds of empathy: Warm empathy, involving feeling the emotional states of others, and cold empathy, which involves gauging coolly and dispassionately what another person might be thinking (think poker). Psychopaths excel at the latter, so its not that they are incapable of empathy. They just have a strong preference for one type over the other.Reasoning of a psychopath: ""What's worse, from a moral perspective? Beating someone up who deserves it? Or beating yourself up, who doesn't? If you're a boxer, you do everything in your power to put the other guy away as soon as possible, right? So why are people prepared to tolerate ruthlessness in sport, but not in everyday life? What's the difference?""*a psychopath's take: Charm is the ability to roll out a red carpet for those you cannot stand in order to fast-track them, as smoothly and efficiently as possible, in the direction you want them to go. People are as nice as you make them. Which, of course, gives you a heck a lot of power over them.They say courage is a virtue, right? But what if you don't need courage? What if you don't have fear to start with? Then you wouldn't need courage to overcome it, do you? If these mind games wouldn't have bothered me, that doesn't make me brave. If I couldn't give a shit in the first place, how can it?(Gives a new take on the courage ain't the absence of fear quote)A certain degree of cognitive empathy, a modicum of 'theory of mind', is an essential requirement for the sadistic serial killer (knowing what emotional states one's manipulations are achieving). There has to be a degree of emotional empathy too (knowing how one's victims feel), for the sadism to work."

Probably more so due to the amount of true crime shows I've watched since marrying my husband. Psychopaths are scary, right? Well, yes and no. Depends on if you're talking about the serial murderer type, or the business CEO type. Or someone like James Bond. Yes, the author says our beloved Bond is most likely a psychopath - or at least he could be, if Her Majesty's Secret Service hadn't gotten to him first.It's a good read, and thankfully, Dutton keeps it somewhat light. It's a serious topic, and the idea that many of the people around you have several of the traits that could lead to a life of crime isn't a pleasant one - having some moments of humor is much appreciated, the literary equivalent of a funny scene in a horror movie.What I found most interesting is that I'm not nearly as ""good"" a human being as I'd like to think I am. For example, there's the Trolley Test. You and a very overweight - OK, obese - person are standing on a rise above a railway. There's a problem ahead, though, one that will cause a massive crash, and the people on the trolley will all die. However, if something could be placed in front of the trolley, on the tracks, the riders will be saved. Yep, you guessed it - the only thing available is the person next to you. Your dilemma (if it is one for you) is this - do you sacrifice the obese person, using them to save the riders? Or do you let those people perish, as you and the overweight man/woman watch? I thought about this one quite a bit, and before you say it's just wrong to even think about pushing your co-viewer, this is what I found myself thinking: What if the obese person was an evil person? Say Hitler was standing next to me, weighing in at 400+ pounds - could I really let those trolley folks die, knowing that the demise of the evil person next to me could save them? I have to tell you - I would push him over the cliff. I would feel bad about it, I'm sure, but in the end, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one....or something along those lines. (thank you Star Trek).Of course, the really, really ""good"" person would probably through him or herself off the cliff, and hope that would do the trick. ;-)Dutton has at least one other book, and I'm thinking about looking for that one. Hopefully, it will be as good as this one."
63,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9023406-lesley-wilson,4,"If you hear the word psychopath and it immediately conjures the image of a merciless serial killer who takes pleasure in his victims’ pain and suffering, you would be in good company. But you wouldn't necessarily be right - at least not entirely. This is only one facet of what it means to be a psychopath. This is the premise of the book The Wisdom of Psychopaths.Author Kevin Dutton is a research psychologist who has studied psychopaths to see what mankind can learn from these highly driven and focused individuals. What he reveals may leave you cold. He contends that many of the people we know in everyday life may be--no, are in fact--psychopaths. They are lawyers, surgeons, military special ops, day traders, CEOs, and even clergymen. The main traits of the psychopath, as detailed by Dutton, are that they are fearless, confident, narcissistic, charismatic, ruthless and focused. Sound like anyone you know? The difference between the psychopathic businessman and the serial killer may lie in the businessman’s ability to dial back any violent tendencies and emulate the acceptable behaviours of mainstream society. He can pretend to care but he really doesn't. He can use his skills to forge ahead on many projects and goals that others are too timid to pursue and he doesn't care who gets hurt in the process.Dutton maintains that the world needs psychopaths if we are to progress and move forward. They make things happen.Overall, I found this book very informative and enjoyable, even if the idea of living among psychopaths frightens me a little. However, I felt it left me wanting more. I wanted more interviews with the violent criminals, more insight into their thoughts and motivations. I wanted to know how psychopaths manage with spouses and children, how they make their everyday lives work, how they manage friendships. This has prompted me to look for other books on the subject to satisfy my unfed curiosity."
64,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3388713-richard-gazala,3,"Ken Dutton’s “The Wisdom of Psychopaths” has a lot going for it, and just about as much going the other way. Touching first on the latter, be warned that anyone traumatized by a psychopath will find this book a tough read for that reason alone, as Dutton avoids as much as he can overtly (much less negatively) judging the psychopaths who populate his book. Accordingly, if you’re looking for a book defining psychopaths as only vile, this isn’t the read for you. Further, Dutton’s writing style can grate. What he and his editors seemingly consider wry or clever often clunks rather badly, particularly when he stumbles (many times) transitioning from fairly dry academic data to an attempted lighter touch in interpreting that data for his lay readers.None of the foregoing detracts from the book’s fascinating glimpses inside the cold machine that is a psychopath’s mind. Via the afore-mentioned data analysis as well as personal interviews in a variety of places where psychopaths hide in plain sight, Dutton considers the (d)evolution of the psychopath from prehistory to present-day. The interviews are the most enlightening of the book’s features. The problem with the interviews, of course, is it’s unknowable whether the inscrutable subjects of Dutton’s scrutiny are telling truth or spinning lie; but then again that’s part of the matter’s intrigue, and the purported ""wisdom"" referenced in the title.Everyone knows at least one psychopath. If you think you don’t, that’s only because the psychopath you know lurks behind an appealing façade of charm, stalking the opportune moment to reveal his true, dark colors at the time and place of his choosing. Dutton’s book provides valuable clues to watch out for should the psychopath near you start to lift his mask. After all, you cannot fight what you cannot see."

The author creates a compelling study of psychopaths. I know you’re thinking psychology is a boring read, but Dutton provides fascinating insights without bogging the reader down in technical jargon. It’s actually an enjoyable read. The reader enters the mind of those folks we try to avoid. We’re shown that while we might not like the idea, psychopaths are all around us, and many are productive members of society. You see, the psychopathic mind is not limited to criminals. You can find psychopaths in high levels of society. Basically, they’re more successful than many “normals.” We don’t recognize them because, as Dutton points out, psychopaths have“…the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal everyday folk, while behind the façade—the brutal brilliant disguise—beats the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator.”Aside from the valuable information this book provided me as a writer, I found the author's writing style very easy to slip into. Dutton uses descriptive and sometimes surprising language to carry you along on what could be a very technical and mind-numbing journey. In doing so, he creates imagery that makes the information easy to digest and to remember. Dutton has a distinct talent for teaching without lecturing, and the information in the pages of this book is fascinating and though-provoking. Also, you know you’re wondering if you’re “normal.”Full review to come at www.onfictionwriting.com"
67,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439410-darcia-helle,4,"I've long been intrigued by the human mind and what shapes our personalities and decision-making and, as such, found this a compelling read. Kevin Dutton's research approach is far from the typical morbid fascination in the violent crimes of psychopaths. Instead, we look at what makes the psychopathic mind different from the average person's, and how some of those differences make them quite successful in certain careers.Dutton's writing style is easy to fall into. While I wouldn't call this light reading (I can't imagine anything on this topic that would be), it doesn't read like a text book. The research is well explained without being overly detailed.Dutton stresses that not all psychopaths are evil or murderers. We spend a lot of time looking at ""functional"" psychopaths who are nonviolent and quite successful. My one problem here is that, while we're treated to all the reasons they can be beneficial to society, Dutton doesn't examine the disastrous effects these ""functional"" psychopaths can have on families or even work environments. This book brings up the entire concept of free will, which is perhaps a side effect of the exploration. While only touched on lightly here, after reading this it's impossible not to question how many of our decisions are truly free will, and how many are simply a product of our genetic makeup."
68,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,4,"Bottom line takeaways: Psychopaths are bad asses and humans are weak and nervous.This is an interesting book in that, by showing how psychopaths operate they get stuff done and make huge achievements. It's uh, an inspiring read?Politicians possess a lot of psychopathic traits: example: take advantage of others before they do it to you. Kennedy and Clinton were seen to be psychopaths. They were persuasive, charming, and had strong positive views of themselves. Personal advancement is a theme. Positive psychopath traits: they are like zen masters in that they operate from a ""flow"" state of living in the now which is great for time management and with a calm nature. They have great powers of concentration. They are fearless, and not distracted by emotions since they don't feel emotions. They are very action-oriented. Psychopaths work well under pressure and in emergencies as they don't worry. They achieve a lot since they are always moving forward without this worry. They end up being huge risk takers. Scary side notes: There are more psychopaths in today's world than ever before. Studies have proven that compassion for fellow man has fallen by a lot in the past 30 years. ""Generation Me"" is more narcissistic and shallow. They grew up seeing more violence, emulating pop stars who have similar traits to psychopaths, and watching online porn. "
69,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,2,"I started listening to this as an audiobook. I found my concentration drifting off, and thought perhaps a print book would be better. It certainly helped with viewing the various tables and charts, which were completely dull when being read out loud. However, I then found myself skipping and skimming because the author seems to be saying the same thing over and over. Psychopathy is a spectrum not an absolute condition. OK. Psychopathy can be a good thing in the right place and to the right degree - for example surgeons, lawyers and special forces soldiers have to set aside emotion and focus on the task at hand. OK. But then he just goes round and round, getting nowhere. He gives lots of anecdotes from people he has met, from serial killers to gamblers to con artists. He also quotes lots of research and he tells of conversations with many academics in the field. So this should be a better book than it is. There's plenty of content, just not much direction.The most chilling thought that I'm left with is that psychopaths can identify weaknesses and guilt in others more easily than the rest of us do. That's how they know how best to take advantage of people. It's not that they can't see other people's emotions, it's just that they don't care - they just see those emotions as a way to get what they want. Quite scary."

I am a writer, so I bought this book as a reference for creating better ""bad guys."" Every good book needs one or two psychopaths, no? I thought I'd skim it for a some traits and clues into the world of a psychopath. As it turns out, I was captivated by the stories, the writing, and the way Kevin Dutton interweaves the lives and traits of psychopaths with ""normal"" people. For instance, surgeons, astronauts, and corporate CEOs have—and MUST have—many psychopathic qualities, qualities that are necessary to reach the highest level of their professions. They just don't normally cross that all-important line into violence. The Wisdom of Psychopaths is about 220 pages, so not a long book. Dutton mixes a keen sense of humor in with his stories and anecdotes so it reads pretty fast. My only knock is that some of the stories/studies start to feel redundant... although, maybe that just goes to show how many and how long psychopaths have been around. I imagine it was a challenge for him to find the professional/public balance of data and information. But keep reading... he doesn't even get to Saint Paul until page 189—and that's an interesting story.Fascinating book. Glad I bought it.Four Stars."

It wasn't mind-blowing by any means (I assumed going into it that the result would be that having some psychopathic traits would be helpful in life), but it was very interesting. The writing style was approachable but not too simplistic. It was a little repetitive at times, but Dutton's breadth of examples and facts made it quite a fascinating read. The book provides ways to ""work on"" good ""psychopathic traits"" you could possess (there's a quiz to determine which you have), such as how to focus on the moment and not worry about things. I guess this book was helpful in making me understand that my rather cold way of looking at things is a little aberrant but it could actually help me in my job. Sweet!Also, this book was the best sentence ever: ""The neural tsunami of madness need not, in other words, wash apocalyptically up on the crystalline shores of logic.""

72,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,3,"I've always wondered about psychopaths as everyone seems to have such a fascination with them; I've always thought that it would on the one hand be so much better. You would never have to feel overwhelmed by emotions again. You would be fearless and achieve your best as you wouldn't be wracked with self-doubt or anxiety. I miss my youth as then I was less self-aware and more confident in my abilities; ignorance is bliss. Then again as Dutton explains psychopathy does have it's downsides as you can never connect with and truly care about another person. Then again they don't care, so does that really matter to them? That said Dutton did explain how they do understand morals; they just have no compulsion to follow them. I really enjoyed how Dutton substantiated his argument with scientific and psychological research as this added depth to the narrative which most discussions of psychopathy lack. Dutton explains that we can learn a lot from psychopaths and that if it wasn't advantageous and evolutionarily stable it would have died out as a trait. I was also fascinated to learn that you can induce psychopathy with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation which is used to prevent auditory hallucinations such as voices in those who have schizophrenia."

This book of course does not have all of the answers - but it does have some of the answers. And it at least points my mind in a direction. I found it truly interesting how the author exprienced TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation)in order to get a feeling of what being a psychopath is like. I would love to be able experience that too :)I read some other reviews by people who were not so favorably impressed with the book - and somehow they seem to have missed the points being made by the author.I don;t believe the author was saying that being a psychopath is a good thing - but that it is on a continuum and that many of us share some of those characteristics. And that some of those characteristics can be helpful... not murdering others, but being so focused in the moment that fear subsides.Anyway - I really enjoyed the book :)"

Dutton surprised me with some facts on the 'inner life' of the psychopath too; they're not strictly devoid of all emotion (one can't be a sadistic psychopath without empathy - it's just no fun otherwise) in some circumstances they behave more altruistically than 'normal' people, and also share some traits with Buddhist monks. They are also perform better in some high-stress, risky occupations, in the military, stock-exchange, surgery and so on.

This book has made the scales fall from my eyes.Kevin Dutton does a fantastic job of covering the breadth of writings and experiments going on in this space.

However, I felt it could have been better - there was too much information presented too shallowly. There was a lot of jumping from theory to theory and experiment to experiment. I also thought the subtitle was disingenuous. The bottom line seemed to be, some people are psychopaths because of the make-up of their brains. Depending on the level this can be a good thing or a very bad thing - a brilliant surgeon or a serial killer. However, it DEPENDS UPON THE MAKEUP OF THEIR BRAINS. It is not something - at least according to this book - that can be learned, so I guess what they teach us about success is hope you're born with just the right level of psychopathy so you can be really successful."

97,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"I understood a lot of things from this book but the very striking thing that I understood from this book is that I don't like reading PSYCHOLOGY books -This will the last one that I will ever read. Because it is utterly boring and more technical for the general reader. The Author goes in depth about various regions of the brain along with what they control and the machines that various psychology majors use to perform tests on brains of people. Absolutely not required for me! I wish I hadn't picked up this book and started reading, because once I start I have to finish or else it would leave a bad after taste of having left behind something incomplete.The concept is good - The author did a full research on Psychopaths their traits, their thought process and their emotions and differentiated them with normal people, people with disabilities, sadists vs the delinquints and the crazy ones. He compared how these people, if they can channel their psychopathic nature into corporate entities would end up being the CEO's and if they could concentrate their energies into trading could shake the stock exchange and so on....I beg to differ - Psychopath by definition is someone who has little or no control over specific emotions. Deriving pleasure from pain of others - this is inherent in everyone, even kids love revenge but after the revenge is over - they return to normal. Psychopaths, continue i.e. they can't stop the revenge mode and derive ""high"" through emotion. I am not sure if that is how somebody would define a psychopath, but that is how I understand such people. People who lack control over themselves and their urges. Kleptomanics, pedophiles, obsessive smokers though all of them are not psychopaths, they are to some extent unable to control their urges. So many of these people who can't control their actions are by default psychopaths and thus most of the human population are psychopaths on a rainbow scale i.e. you can't say when it stops or where it stops and where it begins. But the reasoning of the author that people can derive profit from these psychopaths by taming them is baseless. Though he tried his best to prove otherwise by spending his valuable time interviewing psychopaths and visiting mental institutions, with machines analyzing brains. Alas, he can't ask people to be psychopaths to obtain success.He dissects Psychopathic traits and asks us to embrace the ones that give them success while minimize the ones that get them into the jails all over the world. Does he not understand that these attributes come as conjoint twins? Why does he take the trouble to become technical about this and convince the reader about the impossible. All that being said - The title of that book is misleading - Psychopaths only have one thing to teach us ""DON'T BE US"" - They can be used as the anti-example of how not to live your life! Thus they can inspire or let people identify themselves as psychopaths at an early age and then start repairing themselves. Alas these psychopaths have nothing real to offer, they are merely broken people with extreme loss of fear, consequences and control of themselves! The name of the book deceives people into believing that there is something useful inside it. Alas, there isn't for the average joe anyway. But, this might be really useful for psychology students, I guess or for future psychopaths to understand themselves and become a practicing psychopath quicker by refining the qualities for murder, small talk, flattery, persuasion etc... while hiding their graver dark side, till the last minute. Thus this book should be named ""Dissection of a Psychopath - A step by step guide to build a Psychopath from scratch"" Does the author not understand that this work can be used by a Govt Underground research facility to destroy the specific characteristics that make us ""non-psychopaths"" i.e ""humans""???"
98,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46341246-bree-riley,1,"I think this book was aiming to be provocative and shocking and I can appreciate what the author was going for. The premise is that many psychopathic traits (such as ruthlesness and absence of fear) can be the key to success -- as long as they aren't ""dialed up too far"" as the author describes it. This is obviously true in the business world but I have nothing but disdain for this kind of heartless, cutthroat attitude as displayed in the ""anything to get to the top"" world of big business CEOs. I don't believe in striving for material success when it comes at the expense of other people (and it always does). I borrowed this book from a friend who is studying criminology. From the perspective of trying to understand human behaviour I was really intrigued by this book. The idea that psychopathy is on a spectrum rather than a yes or no thing is a really important way to view the topic. That being said, I had a lot of issues with the way the book was written. Some of my dislike comes from personal preference (the writing style was too casual for my taste and felt like it was trying too hard to be clever in a lot of places). But most of my dislike came from the author's fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to mental illness and neurodiversity. He used the terms ""autistic,"" ""anorexic,"" ""schizophrenic,"" and ""bipolar"" as adjectives. (My friend looked up the word schizophrenic and the dictionary does list it as an adjective but I think that usage is dated and insensitive). I'm frustrated with the use of these words as adjectives because they trivialize the struggles of people who actually deal with these conditions. The author also implicitly suggested that autism is a mental illness which it is not (it's a form of neurodivergency). The preface focused on the idea that mental disorders all come with silver linings (which he used as a lead up to explain why psychopathic traits can lead to success). I disagree entirely. Mental disorders can be managed and treated and people with mental disorders often go on to lead happy & satisfying lives. But the disorders themselves are, by definition, maladapative. Here is one example he gave for silver linings :""Even depression has its advantages. Recent research suggests that despondency helps us think better -- and contributes to increased attentiveness and enhanced problem-solving ability. In an ingenious experiment, Joe Forgas, professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales, placed a variety of trinkets, such as toy soldiers, plastic animals, and miniature cars, near the checkout counter of a small stationery store in Sydney. As shoppers made their way out, Forgas tested their memory, asking them to list as many of the items as possible. But there was a catch. On some days the weather was rainy, and Forgas piped Verdi's Requiem through the store; on other days it was sunny and shoppers were treated to a blast of Gilbert and Sullivan. The results couldn't have been clearer: shoppers in the ""low mood"" condition remembered nearly four times as many of the knickknacks. The rain made them sad, and their sadness made them pay more attention. "" I have so many issues with this I don't even know where to start. To equate a low mood with depression is so shockingly ignorant I cannot believe a professor of psychology would make that mistake. Everything about this experiment shows a failure to understand depression. I realize that the experiment was not carried out by the author and the author merely used it as an example to make his point. But the point was offensively and egregiously misinformed.To get to my point -- I learned a few things but I am sure there are more reliable sources out there for learning about psychopathy. Pass me on this one."
99,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58530751-james,3,"This was in equal parts interesting and frustrating. Interesting both in abstract and in content, and some of the tangential topics were the ones that got my attention. But frustrating in that I'm still not sure what Dutton's conclusion was, the structure wasn't the best and reading the notes at the end, I'm not sure the tone of the book was reflective of the author's overall view.I've previously read The Psychopath Test and The Sociopath Next Door, and this was an interesting counterpoint. This had more interviews, in the manner of the former, but written by an academic, there was more scope for personal statements of authority. What I much preferred about this book to Stout's was that there was less in the way of aggregated traits in fictional case studies (my overriding memory of said book), and more in the way of discussion of what makes a psychopath different from the rest of us, bad and not so bad. As Dutton is an academic, I wonder whether I have gone the wrong end of the stick, but there often seemed to be discussions of states of mind similar to that of psychopaths, without a distinction being made* that this was not the same.The first part deals with what a psychopath is, the following chapters are more broadly about psychopaths and life in general. Compared to the other books I've mentioned, there was more discussion of a psychopathy spectrum, and whether it's more appropriate to talk about people with more or fewer psychopathic traits. There was also a look at game theory to explain how psychopaths don't die out. (Incidentally, the maths was a bit too convenient for me to explain a 1% prevalence, and Dutton doesn't explain or dispute Stout's assertion that psychopathy levels are 4% in America and much less in East Asia, instead implying a 1% level across the population except on gender lines). This was indicative of the general attitude of the book - a more scientific starting point was extrapolated without subjecting it to any balance, such as referencing Neil Armstrong's intense concentration after talking about hyper-focused psychopaths.*My misgivings about this book were illustrated in the notes and acknowledgements. Having tried to argue that there are lots of things we can learn from psychopaths, Dutton says ""there is nothing remotely funny about them"", in a stark manner that contrasts with his generally lighter tone in the main book. There are a couple of clarifications in the notes which give the impression that the aim of this book was to be an 'alternative point of view' rather than a more genuine presentation of an expert's views, and I don't think it was necessary.I don't need a contrarian viewpoint to learn the current generation is less empathic than the last, or to see the main differences in psychopaths' behaviour in certain experiments.I find psychology interesting and for that reason this book was worth reading, and it was original to see an academic's view on the topic, coming from a purely evidence-led perspective. But reading this, I wonder whether this was quite as academic as I'd expected, and was left disappointed. I will have no doubt picked up more traits to identify the mystery villain in the next thriller I read though, which has served me well since reading Stout's and Ronson's efforts.* I'd previously read Martha Stout's review of this book, and though I'd hardly committed it to memory, reading her review again I feel the flaws she'd identified were a similar cause of frustration for me, so perhaps I was primed for them."
100,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12542379-samuel-maina,3,"I have much respect for Dutton for putting together a book that has so much information about psychopaths.I for one did not know that empathy could be a metric for determining whether one is a psychopath. Most men do not show emotion, does that mean all men are psychopaths? Allow me to quote “psychotic experiences of one form or another (usually of the harmless and nondistressing variety) are relatively common among the general population,”I agree when he states “Psychopaths, undeniably, are fascinating. But the plain unvarnished truth is that there is nothing remotely funny about them.”There is no way you can put such a book about psychopaths and not be a research psychologist. I like that psychopaths keep a cool cut.....amid tension.I learnt a lot form this book including:“Human beings are pathologically risk averse. A lot of the mechanisms that drive our emotions aren’t really that well adapted to modern life.”“The painter Vincent van Gogh, the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, and the father of “game theory” (of which more later) John Nash were all psychotic.” Add Everyone from Jack the Ripper to Jeffrey Dahmer, from Charles Manson to Ted Bundy.“Outwardly personable, they use their charm, charisma, and seamless psychological camouflage to distract us from their “true colours”: the latent anomaly right in front of our eyes. Their intoxicating, hypnotic presence draws us inexorably in.”“Psychopathy is like sunlight. Overexposure can hasten one’s demise in grotesque, carcinogenic fashion. But regulated exposure at controlled and optimal levels can have a significant positive impact on well-being and quality of life.”“Language, for psychopaths, is only word deep. There’s no emotional contouring behind it. A psychopath may say something like ‘I love you,’ but in reality, it means about as much to him as if he said ‘I’ll have a cup of coffee.’ … This is one of the reasons why psychopaths remain so cool, calm, and collected under conditions of extreme danger, and why they are so reward-driven and take risks. Their brains, quite literally, are less ‘switched on’ than the rest of ours.”“In ancestral times, the most prolific and accomplished hunters were not, as one might expect, the most bloodthirsty and indefatigable. They were, in contrast, the most cool and empathetic.”“predatory focus commonly displayed by psychopaths might actually be mirrored in their brains.” psychopaths’ enhanced ability to recognize emotion in others might go some way toward explaining their superior persuasion and manipulation skills—as, needless to say, does their enhanced ability to fake emotion”Pinker got me on this one... “On the one hand we have evidence that society is becoming less violent, while on the other there’s evidence that it’s getting more psychopathic.”“high aggression and low fear all rolled into one …”“[The psychopath] is an elite with the potential ruthlessness of an elite … His inner experience of the possibilities within death is his logic. So, too, for the existentialist … And the saint and the bullfighter and the lover.”“Psychopaths, it appears, far from being callous and unemotional all the time, can actually, in the right kind of context, be more altruistic than the rest of us.”“psychopaths, in fact, seem to be more empathic than the rest of us.”A very informative book"
101,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118980041-jake-whitehouse,3,"The premise is provocative and interesting. Psychopaths have traits that are functional and helpful to us in our lives, in certain contexts. I do agree with the author, there are situations where it would be useful, and he doesn't over reach on the fact its a small amount or small amount of situations - but it does mean walking the same circle for a lot of the book.Unfortunately walking that circle also means trying to square the same circle continously. He alludes too, even pussyfoots round the fact that overall in a ultilitarian perspective you are likely better off, preferring to gush and awe over psychopaths. He points out to the fact the number of psychopaths seems steady at 1% of the population, that in the book ""The Evolution Of Cooperation"" as well as other examples you come out better by co-operating. Inevitably, short-term, fearless, high-risk decision making runs out of road, particularly with poor inter-personal relationships. Even if it is personally helpful, it is isolated to certain contexts and jobs (which psychopaths do seem to be drawn to) but on a societal level it is catastrophe. 2008 financial crisis anyone? Also the inability for interpersonal connection is a massive issue, and the inability to co-operate effectively is never really tackled well. Again, I don't feel he oversteps his point - but never really plays his own devils advocate, and he should. His laser-focus on his point (very psychopathic) in this creates a book with many holes in it.It is irritating that sometimes he does show differences, but seems to then not go the next step often enough in showing HOW that difference is helpful, or unhelpful. Ok, psychopaths do not go into flight or fight when staring at death - are we sure lack of physical reaction to that helps with survival? And in a majority of scenarios? (I think of Billy Connollys punchline ""I dont need to outrun the lion, I just need to outrun you"". Someone doped up on adrenaline would certainly have an advantage there). I remain skeptical, but mostly due to lack of evidence. Perhaps this research is just not been done yet. Early on in the book he used a study effectively in this regard to show psychopaths can be more utilitarian, which helps them come away with more money. More stuff like that would have been helpful; though i admit I am still wondering ""overall is that valid in a complex society? Mills disciples dont seem to run the world."" His point on 21st century living ripe for psychopaths is odd - like the last few centuries which had proportionately more unfettered capitalism, colonialism, violent communism, conquest could ever be a good place for psychopath?I feel his attempt to co-opt saints and monks is seems like mainly crap; correlation does not equal causation, mindfulness as a quality as well seems teachable where a lot of the no empathy, no fear is not. It is also something that never seems quite proven is higher in the psychopathic population versus normal, and two dissimilar groups can coincedentally have ONE similar qality. I know that point feels awkwardly tacked on to the end, but so did all the mindfulness stuff."
102,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33587225-helen-redfern,3,"A one-sided account of a fascinating subject:In terms of entertainment value alone, I would give this book 5 stars. Here you have a controversial and rather unique take on one of the most highly stigmatised mental conditions of all time (no surprise given the highly provocative title). Some of the anecdotes are simply fascinating - they had my eyes hopelessly glued to the pages.My problem with this book was the author. He came across as arrogant and appeared to glamourise psychopathy - like he was captivated by it as if it were an abusive partner who could do no wrong. In fact, I got the impression that he was actually just a wannabe psychopath.Sure, there are some valuable lessons that can be learned from people with this condition: stone-cold indifference to the views of others, the ability to think calmly and logically in the face of danger, and living in the moment to name a few. But there are other qualities, such as a glaring nonchalance towards cruelty, extreme selfishness and heartlessness that should not be admired and certainly not encouraged. Dutton made no real attempt to sift through these characteristics and differentiate between the beneficial and the ugly, at least not for SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.And yet, the author gives the impression that all these traits are like, sooooo cool, and omg I wish I was like the psychopathic spies in the mooooviieees. Half the time, it's like reading something from a James Bond fanboy who wants all the admiration and the cool gadgets and the girls, but doesn't actually have the balls to get out there and face the risks. This theme grew more apparent as the book went on and he had yet to interview or even mention any female psychopaths. If he had done this, I probably would've given this book an extra star. But he instead focused solely on male psychopaths and drooled over them. Another thing that grated me was that the term ""psychopath"" was thrown out there too readily. Indeed, there are people in business, the military, law enforcement, high-end catering etc, who display psychopathic traits - and a higher number of them in these professions than most. But being able to keep your cool in a crisis, to hyper-focus and to compartmentalise and block the emotions out when you choose to, doesn't necessarily make you a psychopath. These traits are also apparent in those with Asperger's syndrome: a different kettle of fish to psychopathy, but with many overlapping traits. And yet this idea was not explored at all.However, despite all the things that annoyed me about this book, I have to say that Dutton is still a talented and engaging writer. Most of his arguments appeared to be well researched and presented in an intelligent yet intelligible way to your average layperson (such as myself). So, would I recommend this book? If you're interested in psychopathy, yeah it's worth a read. Am I going to rave about it? No. All in all an interesting and captivating read, but painfully one sided and written through rose-tinted glasses."
103,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36475228-angelina,3,"- Dutton argues that being a psychopath, or having some psychopathic characteristics, is not really a bad thing at all. According to Dutton, we depend on psychopaths every day and don’t even know it. Drawing upon a wealth of research, he argues that certain professions tend to attract people with psychopathic tendencies: physicians, Special Forces operatives, police officers, spies, lawyers, journalists and politicians.- Traits that are common among psychopathic serial killers—a grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse and the manipulation of others—are also shared by politicians and world leaders. - If you are a brilliant neurosurgeon, ruthlessly cool and focused under pressure, you might, like the man I'll call Dr. Geraghty, try your luck on a completely different playing field: at the remote outposts of 21st-century medicine, where risk blows in on 100-mile-per-hour winds and the oxygen of deliberation is thin. “I have no compassion for those whom I operate on,” he told me. “That is a luxury I simply cannot afford. In the theater I am reborn: as a cold, heartless machine, totally at one with scalpel, drill and saw. When you're cutting loose and cheating death high above the snowline of the brain, feelings aren't fit for purpose. Emotion is entropy—and seriously bad for business. I've hunted it down to extinction over the years.”- Psychopaths are fearless, confident, charismatic, ruthless and focused. Yet, contrary to popular belief, they are not necessarily violent. Far from its being an open-and-shut case—you're either a psychopath or you're not—there are, instead, inner and outer zones of the disorder: a bit like the fare zones on a subway map. There is a spectrum of psychopathy along which each of us has our place, with only a small minority of A-listers resident in the “inner city.”- The question of what it takes to succeed in a given profession, to deliver the goods and get the job done, is not all that difficult when it comes down to it. Alongside the dedicated skill set necessary to perform one's specific duties—in law, in business, in whatever field of endeavor you care to mention—exists a selection of traits that code for high achievement. A number of psychopathic attributes were actually more common in business leaders than in so-called disturbed criminals—attributes such as superficial charm, egocentricity, persuasiveness, lack of empathy, independence, and focus. The main difference between the groups was in the more “antisocial” aspects of the syndrome: the criminals' lawbreaking, physical aggression and impulsivity dials (to return to our analogy of earlier) were cranked up higher.- “Intellectual ability on its own is just an elegant way of finishing second,” one successful CEO told me. “Remember, they don't call it a greasy pole for nothing. The road to the top is hard. But it's easier to climb if you lever yourself up on others. Easier still if they think something's in it for them.”- 1 or 2 percent of the world’s population are psychopaths. That’s between 70 million and 140 million people who possess “the refrigerated heart of a ruthless, glacial predator.”"
104,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26214265-sherry,4,"The book certainly scratches some of our common thought spots (or at least mine, sometimes)--is it a good thing not to feel bad and not to be troubled? those strong and impossible to be detered, what about them, can I be like them? is there some inner elements that make shortcut for success? There are definitely some very fascinating constructs and encounters in this book, and many hilarious moments. As I began reading, I was more and more curious to know whether Kevin Dutton was a psychopath himself--the passages are certainly too engaging and humorous for my idea of an Oxford psychologist. (By the way, it is revealed later in the book but no spoiler here.) And then, I find myself skipping pages. The central points become too repetitive; there are too much extra documentation of researches and encounters to make a point; the writing follows a formula, most obviously with the ""these researchers come up with this experiment...they expect this....and that is exactly what happens"" cases you will find throughout the book--another evidence of how repetitive and winding the content is; the style and tone resembles something from BBC documentaries, which feels odd and out-of-place for a book. I begin to think that this book is given birth by a long blogpost or articule, which Dutton and his publisher both liked and decided to make into the book, so there goes the outline and brief version of the book.Whining aside, I still like how much a thought storm it is, and being in philosophy and psychology introductory courses this year, it is a pleasant surprise to see some of those concepts weaven into the topic and now being seen in a different context. Dutton makes distinction between psychopaths and highly functioning normal people, insanity and supersanity, but also marks the difference with neuroscience. It is a perfect combination of scientific facts, experience, and intellectual thoughts. As I read, I just hear Colonel Kurtz mumbles near my ear, ""I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream; that's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving.""Most significantly (and what gives it three stars despite being a page-turner without reading), it challenges some of my conventional in-the-moral-bubble beliefs and touches on some sensitive and fundamental questions about the observed societal values. Besides being more organized and concise, my other unfullfilled regret is not to read anything on the how-to of exercising virtuous ""psychopathic"" traits. Apparently he wrote other books addressing that. I am excited to check them out.There is a short psychopathy assessment on the website of the same name. I found it in a quick background search. (Luckily, or maybe unfortunately, I am below average in my scores.)"
105,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10222029-elena,4,"1-2 percent of the worlds population are psychopaths. Doesn’t seem that much at first glance but considering that there are now around 7.8 billion people on this planet, this number is pretty alarming. One psychopath is enough to destroy the lives of many people.Psychopaths are considered ruthless, they lack empathy, keep their cool in stressful situations and are masters in superficial charm. And it is shocking to see that these characteristics can be applied to so many people in leading positions 😨The first third of this book was used as an introduction to the traits of psychopaths according to various psychologists. He explains which of those traits may be considered more positive and which are pure evil.The author is so passionate about the topic of psychopathy that he even participated in an experiment, where his brain was stimulated with the help of magnetic fields to make him think like a psychopath. If you would like to look it up on the internet, just look for TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Unfortunately, he described his experience only on a few pages and it would have been interesting to read more on his behavior during those 20 minutes that this state lasted 😁This is such a valuable book packed with loads of information. I love books that focus on one topic but still manage to educate you on other side topics in the process as well.Psychopathy is and will be an important matter in our society and is nowadays also used in court when defending criminals. Studies have shown that male individuals with a certain gene can become psychopaths when they are being mistreated during their childhood. This was used as an argument during a hearing and the lawyer of an individual to whom this applied (he was also a murderer), said that his client was the victim of his own genetics and therefor could not be treated like other criminals 😧. "
106,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90932042-elisabeth-white,2,"I listen to a lot of audiobooks on youtube and one day this one popped up as recommended. As an individual interested in the true crime genre, my interest was peaked, however, I was hesitant at first because I was afraid it was going to be full of stuff that glorified famous serial killers and other 'psychopaths' of which I am not at all a fan. After reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a shot and although I found it somewhat interesting, I disagree with a lot of the ideas presented in this book and I also found the author's justification for his arguments rather weak. The author spent a lot of time explaining how psychopathy can be determined on a scale. He made claims throughout the book about many people he had met or knew that were, according to him, psychos. Many of these examples were not backed up with anything other than a few common characteristics that they had (charisma, charm, lack of empathy to name a few). I appreciated that the author did not directly glorify historical criminals the way I thought he might before I listened to the audiobook but throughout the book he almost made it seem like being a little psycho is some sort of superpower which, whether intended or not, could lead to the glorification of historic criminals. He also made the claim that Saul/Paul (from the Bible) was probably a little psycho because of the story of his conversion. As a Christian, this example really made me question the credibility of the author and his ideas. Overall, the book made it seem like being psychopathic was more of a personality trait rather than a (by formal definition) mental disorder which can lead to some dangerous conclusions. "
107,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58180486-juliana,4,"Psychopathy amazes me, but I thought that listening to this audiobook would be too much, too real; I was sure it was going to give me the creeps and that I was going to leave it unfinished. The opposite happened; it might sound strange, but I really enjoyed this. Knowledge liberates, I guess. Psychopaths’ brains are wired differently, in a way that their amygdala doesn’t get triggered, so they don’t feel (deep feelings), which enables them to act rationally (usually for their own gain) all the time. So, yes, they can be bloody killers, but their abilities also allowed them to make hard necessary decisions to the survival of our species. I started to look at psychopaths as people and not just “bad people”. CEOs, doctors, policemen, guards, politicians… I’m not saying that the best are all psychopaths, but they must have some sort of extraordinary control over their emotions. During the audiobook I also thought about heroes. I remembered a refugee that climbed a building and saved a baby in France. He put his own life in danger to safe an unfamiliar being. How many of us are able to forget fear and risk our lives? I believe that we frequently fail due to pressure and/or by worrying about what others may think of us, so I can’t even imagine what societies could do if that didn’t happen, if we all had thick skin. On the other hand, human relationships would never be the same, which would terribly suck too. Anyway, my opinion of these folks changed. "
108,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27558589-spacewalk,3,"Generally not a bad read although in some parts the author wanders around in the realm of unnecessary and somehow hardly-relevant anecdotes. Besides, the academic studies and researches which he used as the evidence to support his findings might not be sufficiently conclusive. The other criticism is that the author comes to the conclusion that a great deal of Stoic and spiritual traits are somehow psychopathic, which is inaccurate at best. For instance, to classify a positive trait like mental toughness as a psychopathic quality is preposterous or ""People with brain damage make better financial decisions than normal people"" speaks for itself.Some interesting excerpts from the book (I'm not fully convinced of their validity):Psychopaths rather than having an impairment at recognizing the emotions of others, indeed have a talent for it.Society is becoming less violent but more psychopathic. Vast majority of psychopaths are non-violent and they inflict predominantly emotional rather than physical pain.Once someone gets to a certain level of skill, it is the differences in their psychological approach that differentiates people at the very top. The mindset that separates the great from the good, and as can kill in some critical situations, is inherently psychopathic in nature, and also, inherently spiritual.Cerebral asymmetry is associated with considerable reduction in anxiety, enhanced positive effect, increased focusing and attention, and orientation to reward.

It is obvious if you think about it in retrospect, the steel cold calm, focus and alacrity with which psychopaths single minded and dutifully carry out their goals is reminiscent of traits of a Buddhist monk.This book is filled with its fair share of neuroscience presented in a digestible format which takes the edge of the its technicality. Chilling at times and funny at others, this book has an ominous sense of cleverness as would be reflective in a psychopath. It was a thoroughly enjoyable non-fiction read and there aren't many that come by. I especially liked the ease with which Dutton was able to slip from theme to theme while drawing clear connections and parallels.As I pulled away from the book, I found myself wondering more and more about how I misunderstood psychopathy. I always pictured psychopaths as being cold blooded killers. But, I was wrong. Psychopaths are characteristic of personality traits like openness, charisma, short-term goal seeking and risk taking dialed up as Dutton puts it.Perhaps, what I took away from the book was a chilling realization that we have a ton to learn from psychopathy and psychopathy in moderation is actually a boon. To find out why, give this book a read. I really liked it."

It's not a structured book and it's hard to figure out the points. The author has priority issues. For some sections, I do take the time to see more clearly what the author is getting, I got disappointed because more often than not the ""big points"" are not big at all.I also don't think it's a fun read since the stories are quick and predictable. There are lots of stories. Due to their huge quantity and similarities, I am not able to remember a huge portion.It does raise some alarm to me to watch out for psychopath around. I appreciate that.The author raised the idea that psychopathic characteristics have biological roots. But in the meantime, he also offered us to learn that education, society influences can be significant on how people eventually turn out. I strongly agree with this. We are born with different traits, or call it another way, talents. The supreme ability to catch others' emotions and control their own, is only one of them. It is a fact that people can use it to do wrong things. But we should be cautious when we are putting psychopath labels to other people. We should not shut down the door for them to grow and change."

Timothy McVeigh was unquestionably a psychopath. A few run-on sentences here and there, but overall an interesting read. He spent a great deal of time discussing the finer points of what does and does not define a psychopath, and according to whom. Some of those pages might have been better spent giving guidance or suggestions on how to apply the wisdom he identifies within the traits of psychopathy. Or maybe I'm just being too lazy and uncreative to do that myself. Quotes:If there’s one thing that psychopaths have in common, it’s the consummate ability to pass themselves off as normal everyday folk. One of the reasons we’re so fascinated by them is because we’re fascinated by illusions, by things that appear, on the surface, to be normal, yet that on closer examination turn out to be anything but.The ultimate “killer” difference that distinguishes the psychopathic personality from the personalities of most “normal” members of the population, is that psychopaths don’t give a damn what their fellow citizens think of them.Pure unconditional aggression and pure unconditional capitulation are destined to fail as strategies of social exchange in a society of multiple interaction and mutual dependence. As strategies for survival, neither unqualified cooperation nor unqualified competition may be regarded as evolutionarily stable.The secret of TIT FOR TAT’s success lay as much in its ruthless dark side as it did in its default sunny side.“He’d strangle you with his own halo.”Men with a specific triumvirate of personality traits—the stratospheric self-esteem of narcissism; the fearlessness, ruthlessness, impulsivity, and thrill-seeking of psychopathy; and the deceitfulness and exploitativeness of Machiavellianism—can actually do pretty well for themselves out there in certain echelons of society. These three traits combined may well, over the short term, give the impression of a cool, confident, and charismatic individual who’s fun to be with and who’s “going places.” Over the long term, however, things often turn out differently.Psychopathic offenders appeared more convincing than non-psychopathic offenders when it came to expressing remorse—which is odd, to say the least, because it’s something they’re unable to feel.Volunteers displaying high levels of psychopathic traits released almost four times as much dopamine in response to the stimulant as did their non-psychopathic counterparts. These individuals appear to have such a strong draw to reward—to the carrot—that it overwhelms the sense of risk or concern about the stickThe capacity to decouple “cold” sensory empathy from “hot” emotional empathy has other advantages, too—most notably in arenas where a degree of affective detachment must be preserved between practitioner and practice.

Who wouldn’t, at certain points in their lives, benefit from kicking one or two of them up a notch? What was important was being able to turn them back down.“What’s worse, from a moral perspective? Beating someone up who deserves it? Or beating yourself up, who doesn’t? If you’re a boxer, you do everything in your power to put the other guy away as soon as possible, right? So why are people prepared to tolerate ruthlessness in sport, but not in everyday life? What’s the difference? The problem with a lot of people is that what they think is a virtue is actually a vice in disguise. It’s much easier to convince yourself that you’re reasonable and civilized than soft and weak, isn’t it?”“It’s not the violence that breaks you, it’s the threat of violence. That carcinogenic thought process that something terrible is going to happen. Ninety-nine percent of the things people worry about never happen. So what’s the point? Next time you’re in a situation where you’re scared, just think: ‘Imagine I didn’t feel this way. What would I do then?’ And then just do it anyway.”The Seven Deadly Wins are seven core principles of psychopathy that, apportioned judiciously and applied with due care and attention, can help us get exactly what we want; can help us respond, rather than react, to the challenges of modern-day living; can transform our outlook from victim to victor, but without turning us into a villain:1. Ruthlessness 2. Charm 3. Focus 4. Mental toughness 5. Fearlessness 6. Mindfulness 7. ActionThe problem with psychopaths isn’t that they’re chock-full of evil. Ironically, it’s precisely the opposite: they have too much of a good thing.Some psychopathic attributes—stoicism, the ability to regulate emotion, to live in the moment, to enter altered states of awareness, to be heroic, fearless, yes, even empathic—are also inherently spiritual in nature, and not only improve one’s own well-being, but also that of others.“Play like it means nothing, when it means everything.” -Snooker legend Steve DavisLet go of bad shots—and, for that matter, good ones—and focus your attention 100 percent on the next one.The question becomes one of utility: what we do with this ‘now’, this enormous, emphatic present, once we have it. Do we “savor” the moment like a saint? Or “seize” it like a psychopath?“In the distracted state, the explosion suddenly brings you back to the present moment and causes you to jump out of surprise. But while in open presence you are resting in the present moment. And the bang simply occurs and causes only a little disturbance, like a bird crossing the sky.”"
113,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7428447-e-a-amant,3,"Years ago I picked up this book and after 30 pages put it down. Last week an acquaintance who I really respect said she was reading it and loved it. Had I heard of it? My answer, “I had vague memories of it.” So this week I read it complete. It is a thing that is fantastic to read, like getting courage in a bottle or finding that we have a potential ruthless side that could make us powerful while doing … fill in the blank . . . career, that is, if we just had less of an ethical radar. It’s sexy and enjoyable – it’s hard candy with a blueberry flavour, I say that because hunting for wild blueberries mountainside, you could unwittingly run into a grizzly and few of those bears have moral compasses. I now understand why I put it down after 30 pages. Whatever it is, The Wisdom of Psychopaths is not science and abides little in the realm of wisdom. Dutton like so many sociologists before him is quite sure there are many psychopaths out there, that unlike grizzlies or Jeffery Dahmers, are quite amendable to using their unknown psychopathic super powers for good, and that the democratic market place are creating more of them at this very instant. Like all good pop-psyche-books written by sociologists, it starts with the Trolley problem. Theorist, claiming to be scientists, love utilitarianism. They believe, like Marxists from the 60s and 70s that it’s all about numbers. The greatest happiness and so forth. I want to remark on this that I am tired of the arguments based on human sacrificed masked as science. Dutton doesn't seem to understand natural selection and its play on human morality through the two to three million years on the grassy African plain as Homo erectus, as though he hadn't read Boehm, Dawkins, Diamond, Gould, Keegan, McNeil, Riddley and so forth, who have explained it to the lay person – there are many others as well. I won’t keep you in suspense about the Trolley problem: here’s the moral rule: throw yourself off the bridge to save the five people. That is all you are morally allowed to do. You cannot murder a fellow human being(s) for your own benefit, even if you tell yourself it’s really for other’s assistance. Human sacrifice is immoral, whatever its reason. The sacrifice of the virgin into the volcano, the masses of the peasants to the future utopia or the rich to egalitarianism. It is all nasty common sense drivel derived from the irrational ideology of Christian Platonism which we absorb by social osmosis into the modern myth (see Reason and Religion under Articles at eastamant.com). Human sacrifice is not allowed for the benefit of humankind no matter what the excuse. Now about natural selection: we were chimpanzees before branching off into Homo erectus. What happened to make us reflect a semblance of morality? Science does not have all the facts yet, but we know enough that we didn't become Homo sapiens whole cloth and then later evolve psychopaths as Dutton implies. We weeded the monkey out, very likely by violence, and also the threat of force and ostracization. Over many millions of years – homo sapiens are somewhere between 100 and 200,000 years old and we became self aware a mere 30 and 40,000 years ago – we followed, (I include here the lengthy Homo erectus evolutionary period), in tribes of 20 to 90 hunter-gatherers, an exceedingly strict egalitarianism. The psychopath is not a modern phenomena, it is the monkey inside of us, who, through the tens of thousands of millenniums, we reduced to a very small and shrinking minority; a way less than two percent event as Dutton tries to claim. Humans learned to share, and either sincerely felt empathy for another tribe member, or pretended to, and hid their real feelings from the tribe. The pretend feelings were often passed along to their offspring as real and likely had an overall positive effect on humanity over the millions of years of our evolution. Two percent of the population? Ask yourself? Just so you get the gist of it, for every hundred people who you know, that’s two with monkey morality; think about it. You know in your heart it’s not true, it is too high. The writer is selling psychopathology for the masses, and throughout the book, he cherry-picks studies to show you that all of us that succeed have the demon-seed in us, born as we are with psychopathic original sin. And of course, it is on the rise today. He’s selling some snake oil, and the funniest thing is his dark bias against the free market. He shares this prejudice with all sociologists, or at least the hundreds that I have read. (“Don’t even get me started about Wall Street” is one line from the book.) The groups with the highest psychopathic leanings: CEO's, financiers, brokers, captains of industry, the military, pilots, surgeons and really anything that takes a steady hand and a bit of brains. Spoiler alert; there are no sociologists who score in this range. They are without sin, as I suppose are all scientists and collectivists, our platonic philosophers kings. But psychopaths never procrastinate. What a load. And BTW, Saint Paul too; heavens to murgatroyd, he even dirties Finding Flow, one of the few good sociology books out there on what to do with the modern world’s challenges for kids. (For many worthwhile books to read, see Reading List under Articles at eastamant.com). To end on a positive note, I quote from WFP: “Peter Jonason, the purveyor of ‘James Bond’ psychology, has a theory about psychopathy. Exploiting others is a highly risky business, he points out, which often results in failure. Not only are people on the lookout for cutthroats and shysters, they are also inclined to react badly to them, legally or otherwise. If you’re going to cheat, Jonason elucidates, being extroverted, charming, and high in self-esteem make it easier to cope with rejection. And easier to hit the road.” The three stars rating here is because there’s goodness in this writer, you can sense it between the words. And don’t fear the real psychopaths among us, be ready to eliminate them as our forefathers and mothers must have done since we first came down from the trees!"

They have too much of a good thing.""Like all traits too little or too much of a specific quality can lead to disaster. There seems to be a Goldilocks principle in effect. A few traits that psychopaths commonly share could help those that suffer from the opposing end of the spectrum and are filled with daily anxiety and unable to make decisions.While this book discusses some of the basic psychopathic attributes in terms of the Big 5 Personality Traits (high openness, for example), their reward-driven and thrill-seeking behaviors, control issues, and lack of empathy, it also delved into their mental focus, mindfulness, and courage (which are all linked). Psychopaths seem to be born with an ability to immerse themselves into the present. Eliminate thoughts about the past and the future, and anxiety melts away. As does the need for courage. No thought of the past or future reduces fear to zero. And no fear means ""you don't need courage to overcome"" it."
115,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,3,"Psychopaths exhibit a marked absence of feeling, a singular lack of understanding of others. I don't know the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath. And in the book Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight it said many were CEOs of companies and presidents even POTUS and here they said the same thing.The majority of psychopaths do emotional damage instead of physical damage. Supposedly Paul from the Bible is a psychopath. I guess psychopaths do have empathy they just either know how to turn it on or off or it's just a different kind of empathy but they do feel it however these are for their own personal gain and pleasure. I like the book but I was just a little bit distracted and couldn't quite get into it I don't know if that was because of me moving to Japan or because of the writing style."

After just a couple of chapters I knew I was probably going to rate this one star, and yet, from a sense of moral obligation to finish any book before I rate it, I read the entire thing. Because I felt the urge to complain. First of All, the author takes forever to give a definition of the word psychopath and even then, it is not what I would call a clinical definition. He uses the term “psychopath” so broadly, that anybody could be called a psychopath to which he would probably say that to a certain extent that’s true. It’s not. He often refers to psychopathic traits, referring to studies which test traits which are likely to appear in Psychopaths. But he has it upside down. These traits aren’t in themself psychopathic, their combination and the fact that they aren’t controllable is what makes them psychopathic. If I didn’t have an assignment due, I would continue my ranting and raving. For now, I’ll leave it at this but I will definitely come back if I need to let off some more steam. The narrator’s voice on the audiobook is nice though."
117,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16901948-prakhar-srivastava,2,"Entertaining in parts but overall a disappointing read.On face value, the intended audience appears to be the lay population, that is, those who do not have any formal education on psychology. With this in mind, there were certainly parts of the book which included too much information.Unfortunately, there were also segments which included excessively descriptive and figurative language. The probleme here is that it took away from or exaggerated the significance of otherwise interesting information. If you have a specific interest in psychopathy like I did then this is perhaps worth a read. In particular the description of Dr Dutton receiving transcranial magnetic stimulion to simulate the neural state of psychopaths was intriguing. However, there may be alternative books on psychopathy like the Psychopath Test which are better.I was left partially informed, partially entertained but wholly unsatisfied."
118,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18840302-adelyne,4,"A rather different take on the biology and psychology of psychopaths – taking it from a more positive viewpoint than most books which are written on this topic are. Psychopaths are often portrayed as being the villains of society, and are associated with less-than-desirable labels (serial killer and the like) although the traits of a psychopath can be found in many disciplines. Probably understandably, as written by the son of a psychopath, Dutton extracts the ways in which psychopathic traits can be beneficial in certain scenarios. He also, correctly in my opinion, presents psychopathy as a spectrum rather than a binary classification and stresses how harnessing the best of a psychopath can consequently bring out the best of a situation. The commonly administered ‘tests of psychopathy’ can be rather amusing too… depending on your outcome I suppose! Well written and well researched, but didn’t quite have the spark with me. 4 stars. "

On the whole, this book was relatively boring. I found that the system of breaking the book up didn't really work, some topics left feeling inconclusive and some lasting for far too long. I could just scan over the words in distraction and had to re-read several passages multiple times. However, I did, to some extent, enjoy the style of narration in the book, as well as certain segments, especially those about the Prisoner's Dilemma and Broadmoor. The rest all just merged into one, nothing notable really standing out. If this was your area of expertise, your true interest in life, I can imagine that this book would be one of your all-time favourites, but that's not for everyone. I didn't hate this book and might read some parts again, but I wouldn't recommend it to those just passing by. It's not that sort of book."

I felt that the author was taking bits and pieces from all over, crammed them together and then said, ""See! My thesis holds water!"" He talked about one experiment where he checked the heart rates of subjects watching a horror movie, not even a very good one at that. Yet, he does not tell us if the viewers liked horror, were used to horror, etc. What if one of the participants was an avid horror fan who has seen it all? Does this not skewer his psychopath data? Even his insinuation of Armstrong with psychopathic tendencies. Maybe the reason he did not panic on a moon landing was his vast experiences as a test pilot? Some of the things that man went through in jets would make a moon landing seem like a walk in the park. In the end he never convinced me. The data was shaky at times and at others it seemed selective for his purposes. "

The constant jumping from point to point was facilitated very well by the description of the author's travels to meet with specialists, university professors, and psychopaths themselves, be they con-men, business heads, or institutionalized criminals.Ultimately the idea that if one separates out the personality facets of a psychopath, dilutes them and analyzes them, one finds that the dissociated control a psychopath has over their own psychopathy would be beneficial to an individual. As an introductory primer to these ideas, its' quite succinct; if one was still wondering that they may or may not find a correlation between successful individuals and clinical psychosis, one only need to reread the title."

This book is both engaging and humorous as it walks us through the types of psychopath, the theories behind psychopathy, and the studies that are only starting to scratch the surface of what this complex state is. What is the difference between a brain surgeon and a serial killer? Would you be surprised to know that many special forces operatives score high on the psychopathy scale? I particularly like the notion that psychopathy is an evolutionary trait designed to help our species survive in today's ruthless society - although I doubt evolution works that quickly. I can see how it could very well be interpreted that way. If you like delving into the extremes of personality and the science behind it, this book is for you you."

Yet after finishing two chapters and reading later chapters of the book, I still wasn't clear on the arguments the author was making. I may be wrong since I didn't complete the book, but Dutton seemed to be going in circles talking about the same things, not offering anything new. Anecdotes are interesting, but dumping anecdotes one after another serves little purpose. Anecdotes interspersed with meaningful analyses would do much better. A 3 star rating in view of how I didn't finish this book. But what a waste, the idea behind the book was fascinating. This book had a lot of potential to do better than it turned out to be.

Some of the stuff was interesting. I was really excited by the idea of this book, it just wasn't what I expected. Also: FOOTNOTES SUCK. omg, so many footnotes. Footnotes everywhere. I think that was one of the reasons I didn't enjoy reading it--your train of thought is constantly interrupted by having to go read the friggin footnote, which in most cases could have just been easily incorporated into the text.

Dutton has so many examples and explains why having theses qualities would benefit others. But he never said how we can make the more positive traits of the psychopath into our own. he explains that they are just born that way, but he spend so much of the book showing a number of examples and benefits of this. But never how. That aside, the book spend way to much time on Special Forces agents, cops and of course James bound. For me it felt like he was just filling pages with example after example. 2.5 starts "

Not only was it extremely gripping but I also managed to learn a couple of new things. Although I quite enjoyed reading it, I do think that the book has a couple of flaws - the author didn't organize information in the best way possible and some things didn't seem that accurate (for example the author mentioning that his father was a psychopath although that was purely his own opinion). Overall it was an interesting read, I liked Dutton's writing style and I think reading this book allowed me to see people with antisocial personality disorder in a different, more positive light. "
133,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10304791-joe,4,"An entertaining book with lots of real life stories and references to research in the field. Dutton proposes that perhaps we all have psychopathy to varying degrees. He gives the seven parameters of psychopathy as ruthlessness, charm, focus, mental toughness, fearlessness, mindfulness, and action. A true psychopath would have all of these parameters maxed out. Functional psychopaths are all around us and, in particular, in certain job areas more than others. Top of the list includes CEOs, Lawyers, Media People, Sales people and Surgeons. He explains both the PCL-R and PPI tests for Psychopathy"
134,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74702422-matt-gosney,2,"Reviewing information from my studies, this sort of read is again typical of me. I felt this fell short, it neither delved deep into the depths of psychopathy - for good or bad. A very brief introduction. I thought he could have done more with the psychopaths he met in terms of understanding their thought processes in problem solving (towards the back end of the book). He could have asked more things of them, got more examples and gave us a better understanding of who they were. Its an interesting read without being my go-to text on the subject."
135,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46024520-derya-hebe,3,"The book had a problem from the start in my opinion with the test they perform to distinguish psychopaths from non-psychopaths. Some behavious might be attributes to psychopathy but this is a range-as the author also says actually. Defining people with couple of questions, grouping them and making shaky data out of this is not science. Seing thise graphs with no statisticalanalysis makes me cringe every time and makes me believe less is “social sciences” These aside, he makes a point about the functioning psychos in our life, which makes sense to me. "
136,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94582850-emre-bey,4,"The word psychopath looks to have a vague definition and it looks like an over generalization of many things combined. In that sense, i don't believe we should take this word too seriously.Yet, thinking about psychopatic traits seems to be important, considering that those who have those traits are around us and they have big impact in society we live in; whether they're a soldier, killer, lawyer, ceo, surgeon (or maybe someone close?).This book made me think about that, it's well written, interesting and i liked it."
137,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279997-manifest-stefany,4,There is a lot to chew on. From killers and con men to presidents and CEO's. It was a far more entertaining read than expected. A lot of science jargon mixed with great storytelling. Thought provoking and a good starting point for self-reflection about your own beliefs about how you treat people or how you have been treated by people in your life.There are a number of books mentioned in the book that ended up on my GR list. The adventure into the psychopathic mind is not over.Very enjoyable read. 
138,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14708690-scott,3,"So this book reads more or less like a psychology text book, not that there is anything wrong with that. This is nonfiction after all, but i can understand why some people would not like this book given how technical it is. The big take away I got from reading this book is that the human mind is a vastly complicated thing and not everything is as it would seem. This book also focuses on the more functional aspects of psychopathy which is pretty interesting. If you have an interest in psychology and the darker aspects of it then you should read this book. "
139,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4093991-andreja,3,First audiobook of the year. The human mind is crazy computer and like all computers it can go haywire sometimes. We have this pretty narrow view of someone that is a psychopath. A ruthless emotionless killer. What surprised me the most was the part about anxieties and how psychopaths deal with them. We live in an extremely fast paced time and I think people are just not equipped to deal with so much stress. Psychopaths are completely indifferent to such stressful things which is quite interesting. 
140,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108000570-lauren-epps,5,"I found this book extremely interesting. There is a connotation that psychopaths are these evil horrible people. According to the human mind and how it works, we all have a little psychopath in us. These psychopathic traits aren’t always bad as many of those who would selflessly defend us are high on the psychopath spectrum. Anything regarding the human mind and how it functions is so interesting to me. Learning how a psychopath’s mind works is incredible. I need to up my inner psychopath... for the correct occasions only. 😁"
141,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26627520-donnie-cash,3,"Could be better. Very anecdotal yet the author often generalizes something as specific to all psychopaths just because it happened to a person he knew who he thought was a psychopath.I very much doubt the electric pulse to the brain experiment which lets you have the same mindset of a psychopath. If that would really work it would most likely be used by many.All in all, some good advices though on how to copy the positive traits of the functioning psychopaths and why you don't ever want to be a full blown one. In general, it all boils down to mindfullness combined with stoicism. "

To make decisions coolly and rationally even in stressful and chaotic environments 2. To be charming and intelligent, have no fears3. To take actions4. Live in the here and now (like Zen masters)5. To be able to change behaviour depending on the situation.Some psychopaths end up in jail as murderers and rapists, but others are successful executives, lawyers and surgeons and hold high political offices."

I found it a struggle to get through where I breezed through 'The Good Psychopath's Guide to Success'. Granted it was a few years ago that I read it, and perhaps I didn't have the attention span I do now (then I was around goldfish, now I'm somewhere around a dog surrounded by food and toys).Well worth the read, if nothing else it's interesting material"

I went to a top law school and I work at a nonprofit near Wall Street and I'm all too aware of how society rewards psychopathic or sociopathic behavior; more interesting to me is how we can change society for the better. Verged on glamorizing at times, but again, well-written and entertaining in its way."

Mr. Dutton doesn't exactly have the cleanest academic record and doesn't work within this area of research. Additionally, this book is peppered with his own quips and asides or opinions on what psychopathy is. You can't have that if you're attempting to produce a scientific and validated piece of literature."
147,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47183516-octopus,2,"I finally finished this torture of a book by Dutton. I agree with much of this criticism:https://t.co/IjKz3a9qxPIn short: superficially convincing, but lacking any depth. Twisting existing research to the point of nonsense, for the sake of controversy.The only reason I finished it is to find the tidbits of information buried in the mountains of disingenuous logic.Still gets 2 stars because I did read it to the end."
148,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33219719-david,3,"It started very promising and informative. Then it became too deep and technical for me. I was hoping to learn some key insights but was taken into studies and research. The interesting thing is that it shows everyone is unique and take about ways different traits can be helpful (e.g., a surgeon not being emotionally involved and invested). I read the first few chapters and skimmed through the rest."
149,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34660492-roxana,4,"This was an interesting book, although it's not the kind you would talk about out loud without getting weird looks. I just love the kind of books that make me see things in a different perspective, and this was one of it. I find it of high accuracy, it explains few misconceptions about what psychopathy means (example how people assume all criminals are psychopaths, because it's hard for them to admit that the human nature also has its darkness). I have to admit I did not know the difference between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder or sadistic personality disorder and I'm glad this books made things clear for me. I enjoyed the stories more than the statistics and details of the experiments (but I understand their importance in clinical psychology). I'm interested in reading Kevin Dutton's other books too when I find them."

The author who is also a Prof in psychology tells us that it’s not a bad thing to have psychotic traits in us, in fact, you need it in order to survive and to succeed. I had also tried some of the decision making scenario with my friends to determine whether they are normal, or borderline psychotic and the results did amaze me."
151,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44450920-viivi,2,"The topic was interesting but the writer for it wasn't right. It took me almost two months to read just because of the writing style and the pace was so slow, I got bored every few pages. I would have enjoyed it more if it would have been written a little better and not using so much hard to pronounce words that you had to google to even understand the topic at hand. But overall some of the things were interesting to read because human behavior is truly interesting sometimes."
152,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383849-patrick,4,The bad news is that psychopaths have a leg up us normal people by not being phased when things do not go their way while being driven towards success. That’s why you find non violent psychopaths in the top of every profession. The good news is that normal people can emulate psychopaths by being saints. Praying gives whatever we are to the Divine so we can be present to the hear and now and in flow doing what we need to do in the moment. Have a goal in mind but concentrate on the process. 
153,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32741421-razi,3,"This book provides interesting insight into psychopathy and explores the idea that psychopathic traits, in moderation, can provide us with considerable advantages in navigating daily life. Though what exactly this ""moderation"" means is unclear and likely varies with circumstances and morality.Certainly informative and entertaining, but one can't be faulted for thinking that the author is more than a little in love with psychopaths, at some point even likening them to superheroes and sages."
154,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67735759-m,3,"I think it makes a very good psychology and neuroscience book: very technical, detailed /!; informative.And yet, i think the title is giving people the wrong impression to read this book. Unlike the title, which is kinda eyecatching and bold, the findings and conclusion drawn in the book is rather mellow and safe👇that we are all complicated beings, our minds are hard to read, psychopathic traits and high performance traits have something in common but no necessarily mean anything....."
155,0374291357,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68111185-john-canque,4,"Book focused on activities (good and bad) where psychopaths are high achievers. It's a different look at the world we live in.

Rather a collection of information than a cursive recital. Rather a promise than an acquisition. Somehow, Dutton failed to reach the end point, or draw the bottom line.

The bibliography is rich with references to real science papers and research.If you want to have a nice introduction to the Big Five Personality Traits, Dark Traits and understand what is the relationship between them with psychopaths this is a nice book to go. It's a summary of years of research. And the writing is really good."

You need a bit of psychological background to understand some very subtle details. In the end it makes you think twice and it makes you doubt a bit. Saints, serials killers, monks, Buddhist, all are treated in this book. All in all we all are a bit psychopaths in the spectrum of psychopathy. "

Psychopath qualities can be useful in certain jobs, such as bomb squad workers.

Some insightful studies and questions about the nature of psychopathy and it’s influence on society.
