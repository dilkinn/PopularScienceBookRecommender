0,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"1. Roughly 47% of Americans believe the theories in this book to be complete and utter bullshit at best, and at worst the work of the devil. That same 47 percent of the population that doesn’t believe in evolution also do not believe in the Sumerians or Dinosaurs. There is nothing that can be said to make them see that they could possibly be wrong about the world being created roughly 6,500 years ago, but that is fine because I believe the world was actually created 10 seconds ago, and it was created all for me, with everyone and everything in it, including all my memories supplied just to give me and my own personal universe a history, which of course it is lacking since it has only existed for about a minute and a half now. Sorry that you don’t exist as much more than a ‘thing’ (and not even really that, most of you are just kind of there as non-entities I will never actually encounter, but even if I do you are still only in my head, so you’re not even things. But if you are a non-thing reading this feel free to click that you like this review) only here as color for my universe. 2. If you don’t believe you’re uneducated about the theory of evolution, this book may not be the best place to start. I think Dennett doesn’t mean for this to be an introduction to the topic, maybe a road map, where he points out some interesting spots along the way, and gives you ample opportunities to read and learn more for yourself in his 35 page bibliography, but if you are half-ignorant, like me, then you are going to be taking a lot of what he says at face value, for the time being at least. Instead of being a primer into the theory, the book is an expansive overview of the controversies and ramifications of the evolution on a wide variety of topics. Unless one is super-duper smart in all different fields, there is probably going to be quite a lot that you’ll end up just nodding along to, accepting Dennett’s reading of a particular issue and his answers to those issues. At times I probably got too accepting and just nodded along with my critical goggles put safely away since I had no idea how to judge the merits of the arguments being presented. 3. Three is a special number. It’s the dialectic, it’s the dad, the kid and the not so friendly ghost, it’s got lots of other meanings that my head knows but which it doesn’t want to give up right now. It’s also the number of thinkers that I’ve always imagined, and I’m guessing most people who care about things like this would agree with, that are considered the Heavy-Weights of revolutionary thinkers that shaped modernity. That would be Darwin, Marx and Freud. Can this be considered pretty un-controversial? Good. Or not, but at least nod along with me and pretend you agree. 4. Lets leave Daniel Dennett here and move across the pond, so to speak, to the universe of Continental philosophy. What Dennett is putting forth in this book is that Darwin’s dangerous idea isn’t just about decentering the universe and man’s place in it. It’s not just about showing that creationism is the intellectual equivalent of believing that the world is flat or that the sun rotates around the Earth. Dennett calls the idea of evolution a universal acid that is so strong it corrodes everything it touches, or maybe not corrodes, but changes at least. Using a different metaphor, and one more apt to Continental philosophy, Darwin’s idea is a hammer that smashes right through most of Western Philosophy. Nietzsche wanted to philosophize with a hammer, well by Dennett’s description Darwin is the tool that can do that. Plato’s theory of ideal forms? Smash. Aristotelian means and his four basic causes? Smash. Cartesian duality? Smash. John Locke? Smash! Why? This might not be totally accurate, but I could argue it and in a manner of thinking it’s true, Darwin removed metaphysics and teleology and was able to give the ground work for a scientifically provable explanation for the world. 	Removing the science part, isn’t this kind of what the most contemporary strands of Continental thought were trying to do? Isn’t saying philosophy is dead, the author has died, God is dead, etc., isn’t deconstructing everything in sight, travesing plateaus, seeing the world as a simulacra, declaring reality to have been left behind (add any other wacky French theory here), aren’t these all ways of saying the entire tradition of Western Philosophy (or thought) is problematic? Funny thing is, I don’t ever remember coming across a Darwinian theorist in those intellectual waters. Which is kind of strange. Here is something that is being worked on with results, facts and figures and numbers and graphs and all of those things scientists come up with that can be used to show an entirely non-phantom description of the universe, the mind, creation, etc., and as far as I’m aware it is never used. Looking at the number people willing to use Lacan as an expert with his idea that the absent is actually more present than what is present and the present is actually not there at all (seriously did this actually help anyone who went to get psychiatric help? I find it to be great fun to think in these lines, but outside of coming up with neat explanations for texts where does this go? What kind of proof can there be? It’s fun sophistry.), or overextending Marx to cover anything under the sun and stick it with a teleology, or to step back one level of influence, the continued predominance of Hegelian thinking, which where it’s true it’s kind of like saying so what, and where it’s wrong it’s embarrassing the degree that it’s wrong by. I’m a little embarrassed that I never thought of the ramifications that Dennett pointed out until now. Not that I ever really studied Darwin at all, or any science for that matter, but just the general ideas that are opened up by his explanation of evolution aren’t a big intellectual leap to see how it ultimately undermines metaphysics, and can remove the boogeymen of the soul and god from the intelligent thoughts about causality. 4. Four is the tetrad. The most perfect number to Pythagoras, 1+2+3+4=10. I’m just throwing that in because I have nothing more. This review I thought would be more coherent. I thought I’d have something productive to say. I thought my thoughts on continental philosophy would be more substantial, but they aren’t. I’ll have to keep working on them and maybe share them in a review where they will be even more out of place. "
1,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,1,"This was by far the most annoying book I read in college. It isn't just wordy; it's bloated with needlesstangents and almost incomprehensibly dense passages. I watched an entire college science class misunderstand this for two excruciating weeks of debate and left thoroughly disappointed in Dennett's prose. It's simply too long and stuffy for its own good; and worse, for a 600-page monolith, it insists on simplifying things to ""God did it by miracle"" or ""natural selection did it mindlessly."" This is a typical A/B argument that a lot of popular scientists and religious types subscribe to because they only have to insult one opponent to win, and no other school of thought is given credibility. And oh, how he insults his opposition. From his crane and sky hook analogies, to all his snide remarks about religion, to his adopting Darwin's means for arguments about physics and psychology (things Darwinians might enjoy, but that Darwin himself would have bawked at), his conclusions are neither philosophically sound nor scientifically useful. Dawkins handles memes better, Gould handles evolution better, and pretty much anything on the physics and spirituality bookshelves at the store does those domains better credit."
2,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965207-r-a-schneider,4,"As I neared the end of my second month of slogging through this book, I asked myself, ""What keeps you going? Each night you read a page or two, re-read half of those, and then start again the next night.""The answer is that this book is so dense and well written that it deserves to be savored and thought about. For an evolutionary neophyte like myself (both in evolutionary time, and in terms of how much I know about the concept of evolution) the book has some fairly difficult and complex sections. But Dennett overcomes the jargon and is able to distill the ideas to their essence in every chapter. I feel VERY good about my understanding of the idea now. Particularly useful was the concept of a library with every volume ever written, AND every variation on those volumes. Start with Moby Dick as an example. This library contains every version of that book ever written, edited or published. So what? Well, the library also contains a version of the book that begins, ""Call me Jshmael."" There are millions of versions of Moby Dick with subtle variations, some which have little or no effect on the readability; others are a complete mess that no one would or could read. A quick translation to the idea of genes, and we have what Dennett referred to as the ""Mendelian Library."" All of the various ways our billions of genes can be arranged, and the results of these arrangements.This library concept illuminates the vastness of ""design space"" available for genetics to operate in. This metaphor carries much of the book, and has been hugely useful in helping increase my understanding of the ideas behind Darwinian AND post-Darwinian evolution (remember, Darwin didn't know about genes.)The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a five is just because of the sheer burden of having to force myself through the work. "
3,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"For those of you Game of Thrones fans, Daniel Dennett is like the George R. R. Martin of Darwin. For those of you Darwin fans, George R. R. Martin is like the Daniel Dennett of Dungeons & Dragons. For those of you Dungeons & Dragons fans, you're probably already familiar with both George R. R. Martin and Daniel Dennett, so I guess you guys (probably not girls, but maybe) are the intended audience of this review. Before going any further did you ever notice how Daniel Dennett and George R. R. Martin look like twins separated at birth. Seriously, Google image search them and tell me I'm wrong.In fact, if you slapped a Greek fisherman's hat and a black Members Only jacket on Daniel Dennett, I doubt I could tell those two apart.I guess the easiest way to tell them apart would be their bank accounts. My guess is Martin is quite a bit more wealthy than Dennett.In America you can make a whole heck of a lot more money writing about fantasy then dispelling fantasy (oh snap). In case you didn't catch my drift, Daniel Dennett has made a career out of writing about Darwin. And to further elaborate, Charles Darwins dangerous idea is like the acid that melts crystal unicorns and rainbows down into a brownish green, smelly ectoplasm with bacteria in it. Admittedly less fun in many ways than an ancient world of wizardry, craft and jealous, wrathful deities and demigods (Dungeons & Dragons reference). But really fucking clarifying and useful if you want to understand the way the world actually is.Dennett and Martin are more similar than different though. Both have clearly spent too much time sitting at a desk (that was a fat joke), both are amazingly long winded (in the good way), and both are masterful at bringing their epically vast worlds to life via cool literary devices. Dennett would refer to such devices as ""intuition pumps"" i.e. cool functional metaphors (like sky hooks and universal acid) that make difficult ideas suddenly accessible, and thereby more useful and generative. Warning!This book is long. REAL FUCKIN LONG MAN. Dangalang is it long..............I'm really enjoying it and still, it feels too long, almost as if it needed a.. uhhh.....how do you say.....editor? At least one whole (normal) book length section of this epically long book is a ridiculously lengthy and through defenestration (that's right, defenestration, look it up, I'm pretty sure this is a legit alt usage of the word) of Steven J. Gould's theory's e.g. Spandrals of San Marcos and the Panglossian Paradigm. And it's about as warm and fuzzy as a Red Wedding. Oh my god. I'm so glad I'm not on Dennetts hit list. That man can talk ya ta death. Do not mess with Dan Dennett. He will pillory you with iron verbiage and pitch you out the moon door.Dennett tosses a lot of ideas around in this book, but the central idea of evolution as a repeating, simple algorithm is probably the one that will really stick with me in the end. It's a cool way of framing evolution via natural selection. A mindless, iterative process that somehow eventually spins minds out of frisky dirt. If you're opposing that dangerous idea, than I got news for ya. Winter is coming."

Dennett, Breaking the Spell""Is this Tree of Life* a God one could worship? Pray to? Fear? Probably not. But it did make the ivy twine and the sky so blue, so perhaps the song I love tells a truth after all. The Tree of Life is neither perfect nor infinite in space or time, but it is actual, and if it is not Anselm's ""Being greater than which nothing can be conceived,"" it is surely a being that is greater than anything any of us will ever conceive of in detail worthy of its detail. Is something sacred? Yes, say I with Nietzsche. I could not pray to it, but I can stand in affirmation of its magnificence. This world is sacred.""— Daniel C. Dennett, Darwin's Dangerous Idea*The latest Terrence Malick film looks amazing. Just saw the preview earlier today at the theater. It put me in a similar state of mind as this book does. It's too bad that I can't find an official trailer online yet. When I do find one I'll probably make it known somehow."
5,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"Philosopher Dan Dennett argues that the theory of natural selection is a 'universal acid', burning through our basic ideas about science and beyond, leaving a completely changed intellectual landscape. The revelation that mind did not design life inverts the traditional Christian-derived pyramid. Dennett shows that evolution needs 'no skyhooks' - no supernatural powers - and instead produced us and our artifacts and ideas using 'cranes', artefacts and strategies that accelerate development (the image derives from the fact that a small crane can be used to erect a larger one). He explains and answers the critiques of opponents to orthodox neo-Darwinism, and points out pitfalls on both sides, for example distinguishing sensible (in fact, tautological) reductionism from 'greedy reductionism' (one culprit in the latter category is behaviourism in psychology: Skinnerians who believe that all behaviour is a function of operant conditioning. The inadequacy of such theories has been demonstrated by, for instance, the research of linguists like Chomsky)Dennett points out that natural selection is an algorithmic process, and carefully examines the implications for science and philosophy, including ethics. An interesting consequence is support for the possibility of artificial intelligence (since consciousness is not magic, but arises from biological phenomena: the mind is in the brain). He develops the idea of 'memes' as mental analogues of genes; symbiotes evolved to live in minds, making persons of the humans they infest and hyper-accelerating life's trajectory through design-space. ""The prize is, for the first time, a stable system of explanation that does not go round in circles or spiral off in an infinite regress of mysteries. Some people would prefer an infinite regress of mysteries, apparently, but in this day and age the cost is prohibitive: you have to get yourself deceived. You can either deceive yourself or let others do the dirty work, but there is no intellectually defensible way of rebuilding the mighty barriers to comprehension that Darwin smashed."""
6,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Imagine running through an orchard grabbing fruit as you go. After you finish, you look back and decide to take a very large bag and stroll slowly through again, carrying a ladder picking the best fruit you can find.Darwin's Dangerous Idea is the first book I have ever read twice in a row. Dennett is a master of clear thinking and builds his case through logic, but he surveys a very large territory and I felt upon finishing my first read, that I hadn't grasped all he had to say. The second read was as enjoyable but more satisfying than the first, but rather than carrying a ladder, I pulled out a highlighter.I've always been impressed with Charles Darwin and believe that his thoughts on evolution are as significant to the advance of knowledge as the discovery of how to make fire was to the advance of civilization.For the roughly 6 million years since our branch of the tree of life separated from the ancestors we have in common with chimps and bonobos, humanity has lived in ignorance of the reality of how the world around us has come to be.Because of the unbearable anxiety that went with ignorance, it was mandatory that something be thought up to explain things and religions fit the bill. The profound difference for those who have lived within the last 150 years, is that mythology can be put aside for truth. As far as we know, we, on our little planet, exhibit for the first time the universe coming to understand itself. For all the number of earth-like planets that may be out there, we don't have a shred of evidence to date that we are not all alone.Life must be rare, if not unique to Earth. The dangerous idea that Dennett writes about is that insensate matter has, through blind unguided experimentation under a system of order (chemistry and physics) with the aid of inconceivable amounts of time, started life itself and then developed to the incredible variety of it we see today through natural selection.Dennett calls this idea a universal acid because it puts holes in all of the tales we have told ourselves about a god above and our place apart from other life on earth. It's comforting to believe that there is a benevolent creator and overseer, that there is a ""me"" that is not entirely held within the physical body, yet nobody has ever come up with even the slightest evidence that our fond desires have anything to do with the reality of our being.With great patience and a delightful sense of humor, Dennett methodically dismantles every attempt to falsify Darwin's idea. Even many scientists, he tells us, are reluctant to part with the idea of a ""skyhook"", an external, inexplicable agent that has somehow intervened to bring us to our condition of mind-directedness independent of natural selection.We are definitely special for having language and consciousness and culture. Dennett is not belittling mankind, far from it! He sees that we are not the helpless automatons that animals are - going through the motions of life without the ability to benefit from the rich store of information that we humans have built up and readily communicate to each other. We are the masters of our fate because we have the world of ideas that transcends our genetic recipe. There is no cause for despair, but there is cause to be wary of those who would like to return to the comforts of mythology.Darwin's Dangerous Idea is not a quick and easy read, but that is because it is so carefully crafted for the mind to follow. You cannot be distracted since an idea will be carried through several pages and you need to follow the logic. The language is not technical, Dennett peppers the text with everyday phrases. He carefully defines his terms but you have to note those definitions because the terms will pop up again and again.Most enjoyable are his mind experiments, his constructions made for the reader to better understand a point. What if you were going to go under suspended animation for centuries and had to design a robot to get you through that period of time? What characteristics would you give it to best assure your survival? Genes have made their way through endless iterations of trial and error and what have they come up with that is successful? Look around you to see countless examples in every form of life we know, then look in the mirror.What genes cannot do is produce change anywhere near that of the environment. This has been shown repeatedly with great die-offs that reduced the number of species up to 90% in episodes over the history of earth. In our time, humanity in its effect on the environment has created a hurdle that genetic change is helpless to address. The problem for all life is us and our own actions will determine its fate.If you want revelation, put the bible aside and get a copy of this book. You won't need a shaman or a priest to interpret for you, all you need is to pay attention to find out how even what seem to be the most impenetrable mysteries become clear when viewed with the dangerous idea of Darwin's that turns out to be illuminating (and subject to proof) in so many areas.Maybe I'll read it a third time. :) UPDATE 2018, I did."
7,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This is my first Dennett book, and he had me worried in the first chapter with all that philosophy. Then I recognized something from my study of of effective field theory:""Here, then, is Darwin's dangerous idea: the algorithmic level is the level that best accounts for the speed of the antelope, the wing of the eagle, the shape of the orchid, the diversity of species, and the other occasions for wonder in the world of nature.""He also refers to Darwin's dangerous idea as a universal acid, able to cut through tough problems, and as the first theory based on an algorithm.Dennett goes on to talk about evolution, so-called controversies around Darwin's theory of natural selection, the origin of life, the modern synthesis, genetics, etc. This survey was mostly stuff I'd heard before, however, because Dawkins.Then Dennett started popping caps in metaphorical asses. This is my favorite part. He laid the smack down on Noam Chomsky for denying the evolution of language. He tore up Gould's spandrels and exaptations. He explains why Searle is wrong about artificial intelligence. He debunked Penrose's theory of consciousness arising from micro-tubules.He also criticizes sociobiology for comically and habitually underestimating human intelligence in the face of forced moves (situations with an obvious, best solution).Dennett uses two particularly clever thought experiments in this book. One has to do with black boxes and a green, red or yellow light. I won't spoil this, but will say it has to do with Gödel's proof, cryptography, and the philosophy of mind.The second thought experiment is that of people who want to cold sleep until a distant future date. They design an autonomous robot programmed to keep them save, and move their frozen coffin around to keep it safe and powered. This turns on its head the relationship between genes and the brain. What is the brain but a machine built by genes to aid in their survival? Fun stuff."
8,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"This book felt like brain yoga. It was such a delight to follow the logic-based arguments Dennett constructs and the analogies he uses and the way he picks apart other people's bad arguments. Darwin's dangerous idea, he says, is like a universal acid that corrodes all our faiths and institutions. In fighting this, we have mischaracterized it, feared it, or run away from it. Dennett confronts it head on and explains what that means for us and for our culture. It's not overly scientific. It's well-reasoned, well-written, and a delight to read. "
9,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2364794-craig-williams,1,"I hate to abandon a book before I finish it, but some books just force my hand in the matter. I picked up this book because I had always heard of Daniel Dennett, as he is one of the infamous ""Four Horsemen of Atheism"" (also including Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchins). I wanted to read some of his work, saw this book, and thought the title provocative. However, the more I read, the more of a chore it became just to pick up the book. I don't want to give the wrong impression - this is probably not a bad book by any means! Perhaps if I were more intelligent, at least in the area of evolutionary biology and genetics, I'd find every word of this book fascinating beyond measure. Since I am not, I found the book a gigantic bore, with no hope of being anything more than that. I find that, ultimately, Dennett lacks the ability to connect with readers who are not as academic as he, such as writers like Dawkins or Sagan can. Reading this, I had that same feeling of hopelessness I would get when taking a really difficult class. So, with heavy heart, much reluctance, and a huge migraine, I gave up at about Chapter Six. Maybe if I get more well versed in this subject by a writer that is better able to simplify it, I'll re-approach this book... or maybe I'll just sell the damn thing back to work."
10,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944-aj,5,"This book is purely about Darwin's theory of natural selection. IT'S NOT A BIOLOGY TEXT. It's not really about biology at all, but the larger, widely-applicable algorithmic process that happened to push forth original life. It covers a massive span of topics, most rather philosophical, including reactions to Darwinian thought (from Neo-Darwinist scientists, and others), issues in reductionism, possibility, 'evolutions' of meaning, 'evolutions' of morality, and a lot more. It's pretty unbelievable how far these ideas go, and this book expands beyond any one sphere of academia. Please, don't get all cocky on me. Even the Evolutionary Biologists need to read this one."

If you're not already familiar with important philosophical concepts and terminology, and you haven't read Stephen Jay Gould before, I can't really recommend this book.

12,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,4,"DESIGN OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT MINDThis book is not ""yet another pop-sci book on evolution."" It does not set out to convince the reader with a series of well-known arguments that evolution is true. Instead, it assumes you've accepted the idea and explores it as an abstract framework for understanding the world. It is the first and only book I've encountered that takes evolution as a worldview and not just a biological explanation of speciation.I drew far too many wonderful ideas and frameworks from this book to write a review essay-style, so I'll enumerate the most salient ideas by topic.HISTORY OF THE IDEA-Natural selection may have been the first strong step toward viewing the world by processes and not things.-Humans ignore gathering pools of evidence until an explanation of the mechanism is proposed. In other words, we seem to value understanding and predictability over evidence.POSSIBILITY AND DESIGN SPACES-Speciation is not the presence of something (read: an essential nature of a species); it is the absence of reproductive bridges between related organisms.-Discovery and invention are indistinguishable from the framework of possibility spaces. One doesn't invent theories or configurations of matter; one discovers them in design space.CAUSATION-History is made relevant by the future. This is especially true in evolutionary biology, in which the evolutionary past is unavoidingly coupled to the future.-Speciation is determined by the future survival of one's ancestors; not by the contemporary actions of a proverbial ""Adam"" or ""Eve.""PHILOSOPHY AND LIFE-Life is a statistical fluctuation of low entropy.-Life is matter grasping at a rock in the river of increasing entropy.MISCONCEPTIONS-Evolution does not process the ""best"" solutions; it produces ""stable"" solutions.-Evolutionary thinking is not the simple application of determining whether or how a trait increases rate of survival. It is the intricate conversation that takes place between concepts such as forced moves, culture, genetics, survival, reproductive prowess, and stability.MEMETICS-Memes operate under different selection pressures in different groups (i.e. science, fashion) and at different levels of magnification (i.e. individuals, families).-Commitments can be viewed as stable governments of memes. In others words, a stable collection of memes that support one another.INTELLIGENCE-Intelligence may be embedded in objects. We invest some intelligence in designing an object to be used by others. A user may, without a manual, recognize the use of the object and gain intelligence through it. Objects then may be seen as vectors of intelligence and sources of inspiration."
13,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866535-dave,4,"“Darwin’s Dangerous Idea” by Daniel C. Dennett is one of the better books on Evolution available. Dennett is probably best known as one of The Four Horsemen (Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and Harris), i.e. atheists who speak out against the problems that organized religion causes in our society. Of the four, though, Dennett tends to stay away from the blood-boiling criticism in which the others sometimes engage. Instead, Dennett spends his time discussing the state of the science. This book is a very good example of Dennett’s approach as he focuses on the science and the theories, though there are a few exceptions which I will discuss later in this review.The book has three sections. The first section is titled “Starting in the Middle” in which Dennett discusses where the theory of evolution is today, where it started (including pre-Darwin theories of evolution), and how it has reached its current state. The second section is “Darwinian Thinking in Biology” talks about recent biological theories which claim to move beyond Darwinian Theory and Dennett attempts to bring them all back to either Darwin or the supernatural or “cranes or skyhooks” using Dennett’s terms. The last section is “Mind, Meaning, Mathematics, and Morality” and it looks at some of the more difficult questions, for which Dennett provides plausible scenarios.The strengths of this book are many. To begin with Dennett creates a set of terms, like his “skyhooks” and “cranes” to facilitate the discussion and make it very easy for the reader to follow. In addition, Dennett builds examples from the start and in some cases takes those examples through a large part of the book and uses them very cleverly to aide in explaining the topic. The writing is clear, the discussion is thorough, and Dennett does not let the discussion to become too technical, though at the same time he provides a bibliography which provides a place to look for more information on any of the specific subtopics that one finds interesting.There are a couple of things which I didn’t like about the book, the first one being rather small and insignificant. At the top of the second page of the book, and extending to the footnote, Dennett goes out of his way to pick a fight with creationism. Dennett calls “creation science,” ‘a pathetic hodgepodge of pious pseudo-science’ and then in the footnote states ‘I will not devote any space in this book to cataloguing the deep flaws in creationism, or supporting my peremptory condemnation of it. I take that job to have been admirably done by Kitcher 1982, Futuyma 1983, Gilkey 1985, and others.’ I think Dennett would have been well served with a statement that he was not going to talk about “creation science” and left it at that. Instead this comes across as petty name-calling and is beneath the author.The other issue is that Dennett has the same reaction to any suggestion that there is a mechanism other than natural selection, and those who suggest there is he accuses of looking for “skyhooks” or in other words a supernatural entity. I think that this is a rather big mistake, and it results in Dennett being very critical of some others, including Stephen Jay Gould, but from my reading of Gould he was open to other natural mechanisms, and considered concepts like constraints to be mechanisms. Perhaps Dennett’s interactions with creationists have made him a bit too sensitive in this area, but whatever the cause I consider it a significant weakness in the book.Overall the book is a very good discussion of the topic, and is suitable for readers who are already familiar with the subject and want to delve deeper, as well as those who know little about it and want to learn about it. While there are a couple of areas that I would rather Dennett had taken a different approach, those are far outweighed by the strengths of Dennett’s writing, and philosophical approach to the discussion of the topic. This book easily rates 4-stars."
14,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/254676-jeremy-lyon,4,"In this book Dennett makes an authoritative case against the necessity of what he calls ""skyhooks"" in order to explain life and meaning. Skyhooks are the deus ex machina of science, invented to make the case for human exceptionalism. Dennett's able to show that evolutionary theory can dissolve just about any argument in favor of skyhooks into plain, old-fashioned incrementalism.The vast majority of the book is devoted to this topic; considerably fewer pages are allocated to describing how morality and meaning can be generated by incrementalism, and I kept feeling there was a lot of hand waving going on in the final chapters. There was no Theory of Meaning clearly enunciated, but in Dennett's defense he wasn't trying to build one. In fact, he claims that no such beast exists, that morality, like life, is a finely gradated set of decisions in which the transition from right to wrong is never clear and only identifiable in retrospect."
15,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2816733-robb-seaton,2,"A slog. Dennet's prose is seldom clear, too much time spent on arguing about words. Most of Dennet's digressions (70% of the book) seem designed to signal the author's breadth of learning rather than to promote understanding. "
16,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"I picked up this book because I'm an atheist and I wanted to read something by one of the New Atheists, because the notion that anyone would want to capitalize ""atheist"" seemed somewhat anti-atheistic to me (aatheistic?), and Dennett appeared to be the least pig-headed. Somewhat unfortunately for my project, this book has nothing to do with atheism, but fortunately for me in general, it has everything to do with evolution by natural selection and its implications beyond biology, which is a pretty cool consolation prize.Unfortunately, being a non-philosopher of middling mental capacities, I did not understand, well, a lot of the interesting parts of this book, possibly because I'm not up to the mental task, possibly because the author is unnecessarily prolix (I can't tell; attempts to make arguments without evidence may require prolixity), possibly because the subjects at hand are intrinsically complicated for everyone. For me, the uninteresting parts were the re-explanation of natural selection and its implications in biology, which Dennett does a good job describing and will probably be pretty good for people with little to no grounding in the area. I also found a lot of the philosophical fisticuffs with individual thinkers (Gould, Chomsky, etc.) to be excessively detailed for a lay reader. Isn't that what journals are for?Anyway, the rest was really cool, even if I didn't grasp it all. Here are some of my take-homesEvolution implies incremental states for all biological adaptations, including ideas like meaning, self-awareness, the mind, etc.If you don't believe in the supernatural and you don't believe anything has simply entered the Universe ex nihilo since the Big Bang, there is no better explanation for the existence of life than evolution by natural selection, and since we have no evidence that ideas exist outside of organisms or their creations, we must assume these ideas also evolved from earlier, simpler forms. I'm frankly an unconscious subscriber to Snow's Two Cultures, and this stuff is definitely on the other side of the fence for me, but that stance is largely due to laziness, or perhaps even a subconscious discomfort with the implications: it's hard to see ""determination"" in the behavior of a bacterium, say, or to think that there's anything like my sense of purpose in the mechanistic actions of an enzyme. As a scientist, or at least a scientifically disposed person, I generally view these concepts as intractable, or entirely relativistic (kind of the same thing in my mind), but Dennett argues that we need to stop thinking about them in essentialist terms (e.g. meaning is meaning: pseudo-meaning is meaningless), because the alternatives all require supernatural explanations that are themselves unsatisfactory (if God gave us free will, where did she get it from?).To quote,Through the microscope of molecular biology, we get to witness the birth of agency, in the first macromolecules that have enough complexity to ""do things."" This is not a florid agency—echt intentional action, with the representation of reasons, deliberation, reflection, and conscious decision—but it is the only possible ground from which the seeds of intentional action could grow. There is something alien and vaguely repellant about the quasi-agency we discover at this level—all that purposive hustle and bustle, and yet there's nobody home. The molecular machines perform their amazing stunts, obviously exquisitely designed, and just as obviously none the wiser about what they re doing. [...] Love it or hate it, phenomena like this exhibit the heart of the power of the Darwinian idea. An impersonal, unreflective, robotic, mindless little scrap of molecular machinery is the ultimate basis of all the agency, and hence meaning, and hence consciousness, in the universe. (pp. 202-203)Biology is not like engineering, it is engineeringDennett argues that engineering, unlike other methods of effecting change, generally involves some information gathering, making something imperfect, assessing that something, and then trying again with a better design. He views evolution, and hence all consequent biological adaptations, as being not just analogous, but exactly the same process, with different degrees of the kind of intentionality we usually ascribe to engineering. An eyeball is not miraculous: it's just version 2.0 billion.Gould & Lewontin did not disprove adaptation by natural selectionThe revelation for me is that anyone even thought they did, or that anyone interpreted their famous 1979 paper, ""The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme,"" as an attempt to replace adaption. I read the paper in college and my hazy recollection was that it was more of an introduction to some legitimate alternatives to adaptation as an explanation for biological phenomena that could apply in a small minority of cases, and that evolutionary biologists shouldn't assume that adaptation is always the reason, even if it usually is. That's basically where Dennett ends up in his assessment, but he goes to what seem like extraordinary lengths in doing so, to the point of dismantling G & L's central metaphor (spandrels, apparently, are not necessary if you want to hold up a vaulted ceiling). Just b/c the metaphor was poorly-chosen doesn't invalidate the idea of non-adaptive features forming the substrate for future adaption (""exaptation""). The rest of his Gould-bashing might be legit, but I think this paper got unfairly lambasted. I guess if the way Dennett depicts its legacy in the humanities is accurate, maybe it was necessary.The interesting stuff I didn't understand concerned what these kinds of intermediary forms of ideas actually looked like, and how memes can have philosophical relevance without any scientific reality, which was sort of the entire last third of the book, I'm afraid.Good stuff. Looking forward to looking up some reviews.Addendum 1Of course the most incendiary review I could find was by Gould: http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi....Dennett replied: http://www.stephenjaygould.org/review...Kind of nasty stuff, though having just read the book, I feel like Gould misread Dennett, and while Dennett gets overly personal in some of his criticism of Gould (for my tastes, at least), he is not an Darwinian fundamentalist. I never got the sense he was trying to promote adaptation as the complete explanation for all phenomena in nature, just the bits with design.Addendum 2Have to admit I only knew CP Snow's Two Cultures by reputation, but my sister (denizen of the other culture that she is) pointed out that it's kind of awful, and she's right, pretty classic 50s scientific hubris (not to mention classic homophobia and misogyny). I still think people from the sciences and the humanities have trouble talking to each other. Despite the fact that my sister and I just did.

17,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,2,"The repercussions of Darwinian theory is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned or thought to have been overturned, there is no going back from the 'dangerous' idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. To this effect, Daniel Dennett demonstrates this by various means, introducing the concept of skyhooks and cranes, whereby skyhooks are regarded (falsely) as the reasoning behind life itself, that doesn't need an explanation: in other words, a miralce, or a devine being. Cranes on the other hand, are based upon physical science and, although wonderfull in their design, still are based on natural concepts.Daniel Dennett might be one of the few philosophers that understands Darwinism and therefore can set it in light of this background. This might be interesting for some readers, but unfortunately this book didn't met my expectations - his 'crusade' against Stephen Jay Gould's theories was an irritating distraction. Therefore: 2 stars."
18,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31104786-dave-peticolas,5,"A book about the philosophical implications of Darwinism. Written with humor and keen insight, this book has many good references for further reading.I read this book with great interest because one of its topics -- the effect the theory of evolution has on ideas in non-biological settings like religion and culture -- has fascinated me for some time. Although many people do not find any conflict (or even relationship) between evolution and religion, I have found it difficult to see evolution as neutral on the subject of faith in an absolute deity.Dennet argues persuasively that evolution is not neutral on the subject of religion, nor is evolution neutral towards a host of other fields. Dennett likens evolution to a 'universal acid' which eats through traditional ideas and beliefs and leaves them transformed, though not always destroyed. Indeed, Dennett claims that meaning itself is best understood as the product of an evolutionary process. Heady stuff!Because of the broad scope of the book, some subjects are necessarily treated lightly. But the bibliography is extensive and will keep me busy for some time."
19,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"This should not be anyone's first book about evolution, natural selection or Charles Darwin. Dennett, and this book in particular, was referenced in so many other books I'd read on evolution that I felt I needed to read one of his, but was somewhat surprised to find myself in something so abstract that I occasionally had trouble following him. If you're looking for a book about the nuts and bolts of evolution and natural selection this is not it. On the other hand, for those who are scientists, steeped in the literature of evolution and seeking a more theoretical or philosophical approach, or for those who enjoy reading works of philosophy and wish to enter the realm of evolution through that door then this book would probably be more enjoyable for them than it was for me. Thus my rating reflects my preference for less philosophical, more practical, hard science approaches to the subject of evolution, and not the quality of Dennett's writing or his arguments."

Here Dennett explores the implications of natural selection on other areas of philosophy. The material ranges far and wide, from human consciousness, morality, the evolution of theories of evolution, consciousness and morality. The meat of the book is devastating criticism of attempts by philosophers and scientists to find attributes that are beyond evolutionary analysis. In particular, he does a thorough job of exposing the shortcomings of the theories Stephen Jay Gould, Noam Chomsky, and Roger Penrose, all of whom have attempted to put the human mind beyond the reach of science.This book is a MUST read for believers in evolution. It shows how the painful philosophical inversion can and must bet taken all the way down, to the brain, morality, and humanity. Reason and meaning come only AFTER life evolves."

The book itself is written in a boring and dry way. And the final nail in the coffin is the length. 520 pages long, 300 pages too long as he just repeats the same points again and again and uses way too much space to explain simple things. While I do agree with Dennett on most points he doesn't understand human behavior fully in 1995. Today we know a lot more. We have discovered much, much more inherited behavior and while Dennett does go against the sky hooks in this book he would be even more critical of blank slate and religious explanations of the brain today. Read Moral Animal by Robert Wright instead and a few books on evolution. This one is made obsolete."
22,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887419-brendan-shea,5,"I'm teaching this book for a philosophy of biology course this semester, so I'm read this with its potential for pedagogy in mind. All in all, I thought it was a pretty good explanation and defense of the dominant neo-Darwinian (""adaptationist"") paradigm in biology, and that it spelled out some consequences of this paradigm for others area of research (philosophy of mind, linguistics, computer science, even physics). Dennett's basic theses might be summarized as follows: ""We are all made of up little machines designed by the algorithmic process of natural selection. Biology is a branch of [reverse] engineering that investigates these machines. Since biology is well on its way to explaining mind and language, the prospects for AI are bright.""The book's research is a bit dated, but I actually thought that helped a little bit. In particular, we can see now that many of Dennett's scientific and philosophical adversaries (Gould, Chomsky, Fodor, Putnam, E.O. Wilson) were, in fact, on the wrong (or at least losing) side of the debate concerning the potential reach of evolutionary biology into questions of meaning, mind, language, and culture. It's a good reminder that philosophy of science, when well done, can help diagnose and correct errors within scientific practice itself. So, for example, Dennett seems undoubtedly correct when he claims that the neo-Darwinian paradigm can (with a little effort and ingenuity) be used to explain things like the origin of life from non-living materials, and the origin of semantic meanings from purely syntactic base.This is definitely meant to a be a publicly accessible book on science and philosophy, but it's a relatively tough one. Dennett makes a legitimate effort to introduce the reader to some of the main debates in both evolutionary biology and the philosophy of biology, and he presents detailed analysis of many of the more prominent hypotheses and experimental results. Dennett's philosophical background serves him well, here, especially when compared to writers (Dawkins, Gould, Maynard Smith) with a more traditionally ""scientific"" background: Dennett is not trying to describe his own empirical research, but to offer a well-argued position that takes account of the best arguments on every side.

23,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is a book of the philosophy of science focusing on the idea of natural selection in evolution. It builds on some of the ideas in Richard Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene, including the idea of memes as selfish replicators on the same pattern as genes.Dennet’s idea seems to be to counter challenges to the idea that the variety of life on earth could have been created entirely by natural selection acting on naturally occurring processes. He poses as one of the underlying objections to this idea the fact that many people, including scientists, are uncomfortable with the thought of everything being just random because they feel it takes all meaning out of their lives. This is where he brings in the meme idea in. He proposes that it is the memes that have created the mind (as opposed to the brain) rather than the other way around.He also discusses quite a bit the idea of evolution as primarily an engineering problem (for both the genes and the memes) using examples from attempts at creating artificial intelligence among other things. Another engineering idea he introduces is the idea of “cranes” as tools of evolution. These are factors that seem to group up in synchronous ways to speed up the entire process of evolution. He contrasts these cranes to what he calls “skyhooks,” cases where the evolutionary process would get a boost from some outside force of mind or design (kind of a deus ex machina effect) that he is looking to disprove.Just how exactly these ideas describe what actually happened during the evolution of life on earth is difficult for just a regular person to say, but the whole concept is interesting. Except for some of the more far-flung philosophical discussions he makes his points fairly clearly. Recommended for people interested in science generally and evolution in particular. Also for philosophers."

Let me start by saying this tome is not for the faint of heart. I claim to be no scientist or genius, rather a curious thinker, but this book has by far been the most intellectually taxing yet satisfying book I've read.The author beautifully uses various streams of science - from biology to critical reasoning to AI to physics and chemistry - and adds philosophy with brilliant examples and analogies and metaphors, to defend, educate and explain Darwin's dangerous idea - Evolution.If you're a religious person trying to understand evolution, this isn't the right starting book for you. However, if you're an agnostic/atheist/free-thinker looking for an intelligent read, then this is the perfect entree for your mind.I listened to the Audiobook version of the book, and I remember rewinding and re-listening certain passages multiple times to grasp and comprehend the concept being explained. Every chapter's end will definitely leave you thinking for hours, and make you little more intelligent than when you started the chapter.My appreciation for the present and past scientists working in the field of evolution and biology and genetics has definitely grown multifolds, and same for philosophers and thinkers of present and past centuries.I will definitely be revisiting this book later when I'm older and wiser. Totally recommend this book."
25,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,2,"When I started this book I thought I would love it. As Dennett says, the implications of the Darwinian Revolution have not yet been realized by humankind, even though everyone - Darwinians and anti-Darwinians alike - understands that Darwin's idea hits the core of what we care about. Dennett aims to show how Darwin's theory, applied broadly and properly, can inform just about every aspect of human thought. Dennett explains how Darwinian logic applies to human nature, culture, morality, economics, and more. Which is great. But what is not so great is that Dennett forces you to wade through endless tangents, obscure passages, and gratuitous thought experiments to follow him. Reading this, I couldn't help but wonder how Dennett's editor let some chapters in, when his point could have been made in a few paragraphs (or sentences). If you want to read every Darwin-related thought that has ever crossed Dennett's mind, this is the book for you. But don't hope for anything like conciseness. "

Darwin's Dangerous Idea builds upon the fact that the process of evolution is an algorithmic one, a mechanism that dismisses esoteric explanations for specific realizations of design. Readers should benefit from being already acquainted with some ideas of evolutionary theory, mostly the works of Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, John Maynard Smith and E. O. Wilson. I suggest at least reading ""The Selfish Gene"" before grabbing Dennett's book. This is an exciting and rewarding book. The breadth of the author's erudition is mind-boggling and his conclusions are such that my own worldview is being reshaped by the elegance, simplicity and power of Darwin's idea. Highly recommended.

30,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,3,"Dennett starts this book, careful to align the specific context of Darwin's ideas from a material biology context to one of functionalism.With this alignment, Darwin seeks to atomize all complexity into functional processes so that the material moves within a complexity are atomized into building blocks that allow for a supervenience of complexity to material atoms.For instance, he applies this maneuver from biological evolution to behavior, psychology, culture and ultimately consciousness. What Dennett notes as being skyhooks constitutes a logical break, such as the jump from ordinal numbers to the smallest limit cardinal numbers. What Dennett calls cranes are moves that constitute supervenience.This mapping is accomplished by Dennett mainly through a series of analogies and then, through a series of quotes that directly address each complexity through a dialectical structure that aligns various quotations that attempt to get at the root of contrary positions. These contrary positions are then atomized in terms of Dennett's algorithmic supervenience in order to be better incorporated into his algorithmic supervenience. If there is one thing I have noticed, it's that the presence of a dialectical structure necessarily supports an ideological position.It's hard to moralize ideological positions of this complexity because of its range, but Dennett wishes to highlight the rational consistency possible in atomizing our most difficult endeavors (ethics, culture, subjectivity). This sounds well and good, but until you understand the larger context it is difficult to address how Dennett's book is an expression of an ideologue.One of the debates in biology is a dispute about how to calibrate survival. Richard Dawkins and Dennett both wish to calibrate adaptation to the level of the gene. Some biologists would calibrate survival to the species, others to ecology. Some to the individual. Each of these optimizations of utility provide a basis for the creation of different terminologies, some of which are impossible given a radically different calibration. For instance, Stephen Jay Gould, who comes from a paleontologist background would calibrate survival to the species and thus has arrived at varyingly different concepts, some of which are nonsensical to someone like Dennett who only sees atomized genes as being the root basis for adaptive difference.When John Maynard Keynes in the 70s introduced game theory to biology he provided a tool for biologists to compare the utility of different survival adaptations. This revolutionized the field but it forced biologists to try and come to a different basis for how to compare adaptations. I recently read an essay exploring the utility of allowing non-queen workers to breed. Wasps and bees do have non-queen workers that can breed, and it has been shown that the queen may kill these offspring but at other times, may allow them to live so that the workers compete with each other. The question in this essay remained unanswerable because the authors of the essay were unable to provide a basis to decide what level to calibrate their comparison to. Since all the workers in a colony were related, should the adaptation be addressed in terms of the individual? Or the colony? Economics often does not have this problem (individual vs society) because the healthiness of each is hidden by the maximal utility of specific groups. Economists are often political simply because they will hide the (dis)favoring of a group by calibrating utility to the society, or to specific individuals in isolation.By NOT addressing his heady position to this basic difference, by explaining the mechanisms of his attempt at a supervenience view of adaptation, Dennett dismisses the veracity of other views by distorting them into failed forms of supervenience.The ideologue that Dennett wishes to superimpose is that of a consistency from the point of genetics.What makes this position obviously an ideologue is the arbitrariness of Dennett's stopgap. Dennett himself provides this analogy when he explains the problem of ""levels"". He utilizes the example of a computer in order to highlight this issue. When attempting to explain the processes inherent in a Word processing program, Dennett states that trying to understand the program in terms of electrical mechanics, or even at the quantum mechanics level is too much! We shouldn't try and understand the processor in terms of machine language or even at low level code, we should understand it in terms of the operating system environment and the APIs that the word processor utilizes (as well as the user context needs) in order to best understand how a word processor forms. The ""baggage"" of quantum mechanics or electrical engineering would be too detailed and merely mechanical from the point of view of the appropriate level, because what makes a word processor isn't the mechanical moves of its basic units but the functional consistency of its end result.As is Dennetts style, this analogy is very clear, but when we apply this analogy to Dennett's own arguments (should we not understand consciousness in terms of the needs of the individual? In terms of the need for society) does this not go against a genetic view for why consciousness needed to happen? Does not the view that genetics is the key to EVERYTHING, even religion including too much baggage? After all, might not a colony of conscious robots not having genes but needing the same economic, political coordination also form a religion?Dennett does consider that culture goes far in changing the context of what survival and adaptation means, but he seems to find the ""limit cardinal"" to be at the level of the gene, rather than providing a multiple level of calibration -- mainly due to this insistence on supervenience being the model we should take. If this is so, however, should he have not started this book talking about Darwinist ""survival"" of quantum sub-atomic laws persisting in the face of disorder?Dennett is a brilliant man and more impressively a very clear writer of very difficult ideas. But in his haste to push forward a world-philosophy-science view calibrated to that of the gene, he ends up falling prey to the same problem he would accuse others of, that genetics is a ""skyhook"" given the properties of chemical biology from which genetic properties can be derived. In the end, the rationality he sees as being factual is in fact, to a large degree an arbitrary choice until he is able to demonstrate that other calibrations to other levels, on their own terms, cannot provide enough consistency and explanatory power as this one. Yet even this point is arbitrary, after all, why cannot all of these different calibrations occur simultaneously in competition with one another?"
31,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Really good--Reading this rekindled my interest in evolutionary theory and I've duly added Darwin's The Origin of Species to my reading list and moved Dawkin’s Selfish Gene up the priority ladder. It's difficult to do justice to a book of such philosophical complexity and richness in a single review, but I will just note down some of the important concepts I’ve learned from this book:1) Retrospective coronation. It’s impossible to identify the beginning of a species until much later because whether X is crowned the founder of a species depends on what happens to X’s offspring. Example: Say tomorrow a virulent virus wipes out 99% of humanity off the face of the earth, and you’re among the lucky survivors with a gene that happens to endow you with an immunity against that particular virus. Now, scientists conduct DNA analyses and concludes that the common ancestor of all the survivors—including you—turns out to be someone named Sara who had the gene mutation necessary to combat the virus. In other words, until the virus wiped out everyone except Sara’s mutated gene—a massively contingent event—Sara could not have been identified as the common ancestor of everyone.2) Adaptationist thinking. Which is basically reverse engineering the function or purpose of something from its design. An important feature of this type of reasoning is the assumption of optimality: if X would be optimal for doing Y, then it probably was designed for Y. There are at least three considerations that any good adaptationist must keep in mind. The first is the ever-present possibility of opportunistic appropriation of the original function that Mother Nature is so good at (what Gould calls “exaptation”—a delightful word Dennett has exapted to his own usage), which would conceivably give rise to sub-optimal uses or functions. The second is the building process: there may be constraints to the process itself that may leave non-functional features in the final product, or limit the number of possible ways things can be built. This latter point can explain, for example, why most animal species go through very similar embryonic development stages, or in architecture, why the foundations of churches start out the same way. And finally, a good adaptationist should always watch out for the QWERTY phenomenon, where certain features may just be the result of historical happenstances (the dominance of the non-optimal QWERTY keyboard for example).3) Cultural evolution. How memes take up residence in our brains and ultimately create a person. One important implication here is that thanks to memes and their interplay with our brain’s machinery, we are the only species on earth that can transcend our biological imperatives (take, for example, priests with their vow of abstinence). This evolutionary perspective on culture and personhood shed some much wanted light on the whole debate over the “naturalness” of marriage and other issues concerning human sexuality. Is marriage “unnatural”? Yes, it probably goes against our biological imperatives (if anyone’s interested in the details, check out, for example,Sex at Dawn for the view that monogamy is “unnatural”). But what these people miss—and underestimate—is the role culture plays in forming us as persons. Marriage may be damn hard—and most people do actually fail at it—but it is not impossible because we’re equipped with the brain-meme-culture power to mold this amorphous thing called “human nature.”4) Biological possibility and evolutionary path. How biologically possible evolutionary paths are constrained by what came before. It is a question of accessibility: it’s more possible for us to, say, grow an extra thumb than grow wings in the next hundred years (though of course, if genetic engineering takes off, the latter might be equally possible). That is, some things are more possible than others.5) “Threads of actuality” in Design Space. Design Space is basically all the design possibilities that evolution can generate—which is not infinite but vastly huge. The evolution on earth can, in principle, be mapped onto this Design Space, forming a vasnihingly small Tree of Life, or what Dennett calls “threads of actuality” in the immense space of possibility.6) Convergence. Dennett borrows a chess term—“forced move”—to indicate any design solution in Design Space that are so good that Mother Nature can be counted on to arrive at over and over again. This concept comes in handy when analyzing cultures. A common cultural trait may be indicative of cultural transmission (or cultural cross-pollination) or forced moves in the game of design, i.e. reinvention. So from the fact that, say, two distant cultures had boats, we can’t conclude much about their cultural relationship—because boats are a good design solution to the problem of navigation that they could have been invented separately. In the same way, we can’t conclude from the ubiquity of certain features across human cultures that they are human universals.7) Finally, good and bad reductionism. Reductionism in itself—defined as the desire to explain and unify everything under a single grand theory—is not bad. What is bad is when this desire gets out of hand, leading to oversimplification and falsification of the phenomenon in question. So bad reductionists, in their zeal to explain everything, try to do too much too fast. B.F. Skinner is a good example. The founder of behaviorism in psychology, he tried explain all of human learning in terms of operant conditioning. The correct response to these bad reductionists is always: “It’s not that simple.” Good reductionists, on the other hand, don’t do this. They want to explain everything with one big, unified theory, but they don’t rush to get there (e.g. think of physicists who dream of the unified theory, a theory to explain both the planetary motions and quantum physics). Despite the book’s overall quality, I did have a few quibbles about this book. First is his lengthy discussion of Stephen Jay Gould and his adherents who rejected—or tried to, anyway—adaptationist explanations. Though interesting in parts (such as Gould's notion of ""punctuated equilibrium"" and the rate of evolutionary change, which reminded me of N.N. Taleb's ""Black Swan"" idea). Second, I would have appreciated some discussion of possibly Lamarckian epigenetic inheritance: the inheritance of acquired characteristics such as phobias, propensity for obesity, and immunity to certain viruses through a mechanism that doesn’t change the fundamental structure of the DNA. All in all, a solid overview of evolutionary theory with a feast of food for thought."
32,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"After recently re-reading Consciousness Explained of Dennett, I decided to re-read Darwin's Dangerous Idea as well. In the last year I read a lot about evolutionary biology and I wanted to know if after re-reading this book, I would have another outlook on it. On re-reading it, I was amazed at how much insight Dennett packs in this work.Dennett's main thesis - which is very easily overlookd due to the broad and deep treatment of all sorts of issues relating to evolution as a concept - is the following. An algorithm has (1) substrate neutrality (i.e. is indepent of the materials used to execute it), (2) consists of underlying mindlessness (the process is subdivided and sub-subdivided and so forth, until the only things remaining are simple, stupid steps) and (3) gives garantueed results. Evolution is just such a process, and therefore applicable to not only biology, but also to culture, human psychology, artifical intelligence, etc. This is why Darwin's idea is dangerous: it's very easy and attractive to apply and therefore very easy to lead to unjustified use. Some infamous examples of this dangerous idea are Nietzsche's nihilism and Spencer's Social Darwinism.In part 1, Dennett takes his time to introduce the idea of evolution as an algorithmic process, the endless and mindless 'search' of nature through what Dennett cals 'Design Space'. This amounts to (what Dennett calls) Darwin's 'strange inversion of reasoning'. Before Darwin, people like Aristotle and Locke thought of a topdown-process of Mind creating Design out of Order, which in itself started out of Chaos. Darwin showed how a simple algorithmic process of natural selection can create the illusion of design (Paley's watch) by 'working' on order. In other words, Mind is an emergent property of Design, which itself is emergent out of Order, which itself is emergent out of Chaos. And all this without Aristotelian notions like an Unmoved Mover or a Final Cause. In part 2 Dennett outlines the biological implications of this 'dangerous idea'. He speculates - he's not alone in this: he draws on important work of various physicists and biologists - about the creation of Order out of Chaos. In other words: the evolution of our universe, the idea of selection of universes (multiverse scenario) and the origin of life. This 'origin' is nothing but an algorithmic process in itself. When we break it up in small steps, the difficulty of how life can come out of nothing evaporates in an instant. Even though we don't know yet how this process came about in practice, the outlines of the ultimate explanation are clear and physicists and chemists are working on various plausible theories. Another important aspect of part 2 is Dennett's claim that biology is reverse enegineering. We see a specific function and ask ourselves: what was its adaptive function? And is this the same function as the function it has nowadays, or are we looking at an exaptation? By asking ourselves these questions, we can see 'Good Tricks' - convergent solutions for similar problems (for example the 40+ times an eye evolved or the various designs of wings). In the rest of part 2, Dennett deals extensively with criticisms against this 'adaptationist-view' and shows us that either the issues are a misunderstanding or else the unwillingness of certain scientists to accept evolution for what it is.In the last part of the book, Dennett explains the implications of Darwin's dangerous idea for humanity. The cultural evolution that took of some thousands of years ago, is itself an evolutionary process consisting of memes competing for minds in the infosphere. Next Dennett takes up the task of explaining 'meaning'. The question of meaning is easily solved if we take into account that meaning is an emergent property of algorithmic processes shaping us. Design a robot that has to find its own way in this world, all the while protecting your interests, and you have created a survival machine that is built on algorithms and that ultimately finds its meaning popping up out of these same processes. Then realize that we humans are survival machines for our genes and you whitness the evaporation of an illusion. On his way towards the end of this book, Dennett deals with Chomsky's reluctance of accepting evolution as the cause for the 'language organ' and with Penrose's view on consciousness and free will - in my own opinion convincingly. After this he tries to tackle the issue of morality. It is here that Dennett slips up (in my opinion): he gives a very distorted account of sociobiology (misrepresenting E.O. Wilson among others) and skims over evolutionary psychology. Dennett should have made clear that evolutionary psychology and sociobiology are descriptive sciences and that moral philosophy is a presecriptive science. Now he mixes up both in one story, while giving an explanation of one of the major errors in this domain: the naturalistic fallacy. I guess Dennett is not prepared to go the whole way, whereas someone like E.O. Wilson has a much clearer perspective on the issue: culture is on a genetic leash (in other words, the maximum cultural variability is defined by us sharing the same genes). Dennett ends his book on a confusing note. He proposes we strive for biodiversity, not just in the biological world, but also in the world of memes. In other words: we should value the diversity of different religions and creeds. But only up to a point! Religions, creeds and any other memes or meme-complexes that endanger our society should be put in (metaphorical?) cages, just like we do with animals in zoos. How Dennett sees this working out in practice (especially with the internet) is an open question. He ends his book with the statement that Darwin's dangerous idea - evolution as an algorithmic (mindless, neutral, result oriented) process leading to design, mind and meaning - is a universal acid. It burns through anything which it encounters, but after it's gone we're left with a fresh, healthy perspective on the world and our place in it.The beauty of this work lies in the deep, philosophical meaning of the themes described in it. This is a book of 500+ pages on a single idea. It's not a book about biology, it's also not a book on evolution, it's a book about a single idea and its implications for humanity. A true masterpiece, were it not for the last two confused chapters on morality. "
33,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12572650-jaspal-rana,4,"Darwin's Dangerous Idea is, uh, strange. That is to say, I am not sure if Dennett knew his target audience.This book doesn't seem to be written for lay-readers. At the very least, it is not for casual lay readers. You need to have read Dawkins, Gould, Pinker, etc. in sufficient detail to savor the most juicy parts of the book. Plus, it would not hurt if you knew something about eminent philosophers such as Locke, Neitzsche, Descartes and their methodologies.Then again, this book isn't for professionals (read philosophers of science) either. I am sure they would find his arguments a bit wishy-washy. Perhaps, Dennett anticipated this. In his foreword, he says:
I want to get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary thinking seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens. For this, I have to use more artful methods. I have to tell a story. You don't want to be swayed by a story? Well, I know you won't be swayed by a formal argument; you won't even listen to a formal argument for my conclusion.
Anyhoo, it is what it is.Dennett believes, and reiterates throughout this book, that Darwin's dangerous idea is not merely the idea of evolution, but evolution by natural selection. And this idea is the 'universal acid' (Dennett's words, not mine) that would corrode our old ways of thinking, and leave us hanging in the air, if we did not devise new outlooks towards life. And I have to say, he constructs his arguments carefully, eloquently, though not always in the simplest of terms.The point Dennett is trying to make is this: Darwinism is algorithmic. (Even if he had nothing else to offer in this book, which is not the case at all, his treatment of what algorithms are all about is exquisite.)
Here, then, is Darwin’s dangerous idea: the algorithmic level is the level that best accounts for the speed of the antelope, the wing of the eagle, the shape of the orchid, the diversity of species, and all the other occasions for wonder in the world of nature.
And Dennett is not afraid to wade into dirtier waters. He faces opponents as formidable as Gould, Chomsky, and Penrose, and obstacles as diverse as mind, language, AI, and ethics, armed with nothing more than his Darwinian sword. You may not agree with his thesis in entirety but Dennett’s arguments for why be believes he is right are well worth reading. Me, I am a fan."
34,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84353613-alec-eskander,3,"While I did actually like this book quite a bit and think it’s incredibly brilliant, my reason for 3 stars is that 1) as many might guess it’s extremely dense and difficult to follow at times and 2) I disagree quite a bit with Dennett’s analysis in his large section and time devoted to Stephen Jay Gould and punctuated equilibrium. Over all i think think all should read this and I was thoroughly impressed by how he ended the book on the role of religion in modern and future generations. "
35,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"The Mindless Algorithm:I had high hopes going into ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea""! With evolution and natural selection being the main subject, what could go wrong? Written by the well known Philosopher Daniel C Dennett, I was expecting some important insights on this controversial science. Using abstract metaphors like Universal Acid, the Library of Babel and Intelligent Artificer, the author illustrates how Darwin's theory works and how it impacts all of society. While Dennett is not an evolutionary biologist, he is extremely knowledgable on a wide variety subjects and uses that vast storehouse to point out why he thinks the concept of evolution is important to us all. This is, by far, the most difficult book I've ever read, it was, by turn, interesting and then annoying. There were times when I almost called it quits and abandon the book. But my instincts were that this was an important read so I stuck it out and tried to get as much out of it as I could. I'm glad I did! What I gained from Dennett's book was a different way of looking at Darwin's theory and new insights on biology and evolution. ""Universal Acid"" is a hypothetical substance that cannot be contained and so too is Natural Selection. If you really want to know the ""What?"" or ""How?"" of all life on earth then you really must understand Darwin's paradigm changing theory. Dennett explores many facets of Natural Selection starting with life's origin and how and why organisms change over time. Beyond biology the book also looks at how society and some of our most cherished beliefs look different when viewed through Darwin's spyglass. I don't know what Dennett's personal beliefs are but he makes a strong case for the importance of our religious beliefs for guidance and advancement of our society, but our religious beliefs should not blind us to what science has to say and it should never influence our political system or dictate what's being taught in our schools. Big business, politics and our moral attitudes have all evolved over time, changes brought on by pressures from our ""social"" environment. In preparing this book for publication Dennett quoted and/or interviewed several professional scientist like, Richard Dawkins, Edward O Wilson, Stephen Gould and Jared Diamond among others. Dennett and these men did not always see ""eye to eye"" on some issues but Dennett was always enlightened by their input. Some of Dennett's insights got me thinking on evolution and life's origin: DNA/RNA, the basis for all life on Earth, is nothing more than a ""mindless little scrap of molecular machinery"" that just happens to have the ability to self-replicate. The pre-life oceans of early earth were kinda like an organic soup with molecules forming and then breaking up for millions of years on end. Some of those molecules were able to make copies of themselves and, as it turns out, DNA and RNA were the ones that worked best. And the rest is, as they say, history. Of course, if you prefer, the other option is an ""Intelligent Artificer"" that, in an act of Special Creation, brought all of our life forms into being in one fail swoop and they have remained unchanged since that time. The choice is yours. As far as I was concerned, this book defiantly had it's ups and downs. There were sections that I found to be dense and hard to understand, yet other parts were fascinating and led me down paths I had never traveled before. If you are looking for a real challenge in your science reading and have a patient, logical and somewhat skeptical mind then you may want to give Dennett's book a try. I had no downloading or formatting problems with this Kindle edition.Last Ranger"

37,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is by far the best book I have read this year. It uses the narrative of Darwin's deceptively simple idea of making complex things from a very simple algorithm. The author beats this thought in to the reader and at the same time covers how the world changed because of that.The book is really more philosophical than scientific but it's accessible to the non-philosopher like me. He starts by telling the listener the mindset during Darwin's time. Plato's universal forms would lead to absolute categories such as species (either your a donkey or a horse) and Aristotle's importance of essence for the nature of things to be the thing. Darwin had to overcome that kind of thought. Darwin dances around what a species is in his ""Origins of Species"" because for his theory to work you must realize that there are intermediaries between objects and the thinking at that time would not allow for intermediaries. All of the above, I got from just the first chapter in the book, and you too can be just as entertained as I was!The author tells me that Locke would say that mind must come from mind, that is God must have created man. Now, I have finally started to understand Locke. Oddly, David Hume, almost had the concept of evolution by natural selection but just couldn't take the next step to get there. (How I love David Hume!, a man a head of his times). Hobbes gave us ""just so stories"" to explain the creation of society and Leviathan.The nearly infinite decision space (what he calls the 'library in the tower of Babel') gives false security to believers in Sky Hooks (deus ex machina believers, Gould, Penrose and Chomskey), as opposed to the believers in sky cranes (Darwin's Brilliant Idea).The author has long sections on Psychology (Skinner is wrong!), and morality (morality is complex!). He even delves into one of my favorite topics, Godol's incompleteness theorem and how Penrose is wrong to say it proves artificial intelligence will never succeed. All the time, the author uses the narrative of Darwin's Brilliant Idea, simple algorithms can lead to amazing results.A negative review on audible led me to this book. The reviewer said that the first half of the book was about philosophy and how good Dawkins is, and the second half spends most of the time criticizing Gould. I knew I wanted the book after having read that review. (To the reviewers credit, he's not being nasty, but fairly accurate).I loved this book. It's a rare one which challenges my beliefs, keeps me focused and transcends me to hard to reach places in my mind which makes me really think about my place in the universe and understand it just a tiny bit more. Besides, it's fun to be able act like an intellectual snob while talking in a waffle shop with a stranger and have the person think I'm intellectual heavyweight while knowing I only know that stuff because I just listened to one fine book, and more importantly keeps me from having to listen to his stories about some unimportant job he had thirty years ago!"
38,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Really liked the first half of the book, but the second half not so much. Do I get bored with books? Or do a lot of writers run out of steam before they're done?"
39,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037566-joaquin,4,"Though this book is very approachable, it's also extremely dense, spanning a huge array of subjects and approaches. I felt a bit tired with the extremely long tangents that later develop into clear philosophical examples, sometimes they dragged too long, sometimes the point was clear before the reveal, but I have to agree that the points couldn't have been made with more care and clarity.Dennet is a great thinker, he exposes everyone's way of thought as well as his own, always analyzing not only our point of views but why we choose or are compelled to think that way. He is also very nitpicky, especially trying to bring down Gould, Wilson, Penrose and Chomsky, and though I agree with the fundamental point in his argument against their slightly anti-Darwinian bendings, I think he goes extremely far into dedicating a huge portion of the book to pose those arguments.The last third of the book gets heavy with purely philosophical themes, but I'd recommend sticking to the end. In the last chapter, Dennet's writing becomes focused, precise, poignant, and inspirational, he gathers all the energy he's built up and makes radically clear arguments. Definitely worth a read.For people who have read a lot of Dawkins/Ridley/Harris/Diamond/Gould/etc, this book will have a lot of chapters with redundant topics (game theory and such), but there's at least something new and insightful even in known topics."
40,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The biggest fault of the book is that it spends more time in refuting than explaining. At many points, the objective of the book is less about enlightening the reader and more about proving some of author’s contemporaries and/or adversaries wrong. This makes the book not only needlessly pedagogic but also long and boring in parts.The main topic is critically important and the author is immensely knowledgable. The deductive reasoning and logical dismantling of counterpoints throughout is some of the best one is ever likely to come across. The author spends good amount of time explaining each of the myriad of counterpoints, stripping them to their essential claims and then comprehensively debunking them. The arguments are so persuasive that the reader may even begin to doubt the sanity of those who ever made the claims!Yet, these are the same things that make the book far less valuable. The refusals are against viewpoints from diverse and unconnected arenas. At times, they seem to be against basic religious beliefs and at others they are against the subtle alterations made by other neo/post Darwinian scientists. The loss of focus is only jarring while the underlying bitter tone is almost annoying.The first half of the book where the author is mostly establishing the basic Darwinian concepts and their revolutionary implications are relevant for readers not reading this in the mid-nineties when the book was written. The remaining is imminently skippable."
41,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1816198-e,5,"Comprehensive discussion of the theory of evolution Daniel C. Dennett’s book is worthy of its subject matter. That is to say, beautiful in its essence, but complex in its details. Dennett is not trying just to explain Darwin’s core ideas about evolution or natural selection. Rather, he is trying to explain how evolution fits into humanity’s understanding of itself, life and the world. To do so, he has to explain his views on evolution’s context, its implications for human understanding, and the philosophical and scientific currents it rides. He grapples with the emotional uproar that the idea of evolution produced. He works hard to illustrate these concepts, via stories, autobiographical asides, examples, metaphors, drawings, quotes and even jokes. The book is challenging, because of the stimulating content, but absorbing. getAbstract recommends it warmly to readers interested in evolution, and in the intersection of science and culture. Despite its methodical approach, this thoughtful exploration is not for beginners. One other caveat: If you want science blended with faith, Dennett believes that given humanity’s quest for facts, “There is no future in a sacred myth.” He forthrightly tells those who are distressed by this point of view to “close the book now and tiptoe away.”"
42,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7753049-jerry-hilts,5,"It's been almost 20 years since I first read this book. It was even better the second time around. Ostensibly the book is about the philosophical and scientific implications that result from the theory of evolution. What the book really is, is an excellent primer on thinking about how to think.The first part of the book presents a good overview of evolution, but also one of the best introductory examples of the philosophy science is and how it works. It seriously ought to be required reading by every kid in America before graduating high school: not because they need to understand Darwin's theory (though that's not such a bad thing), but because they need to understand what science is and how empiricism works (i.e. ""Starting in the Middle"").The second part of the book (""Darwinian Thinking in Biology"") looks at certain biological critiques of Darwin's view of evolution (primarily those of S.J. Gould). The third part (""Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality"") looks at the ramifications the theory has when considered in different philosophical endeavors, linguistics, cognitive science, and computing. Once again, the real treasure here is less about the specifics, that it is the outstanding example Dennett provides, showing _how_ to think critically, how to _do_ philosophy, applying an idea to various challenges and problems. I can't recommend this book enough."
43,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45113256-louis,5,"Darwin's Dangerous Idea is a much-needed wake-up call to the many academics who still think that all of natural selection's implications can be safely quarantined within biology and that it doesn't have any consequences on how we do philosophy or any other branch of the humanities. Dennett exposes and explodes, bit by careful bit, that myth. He shows how Darwin's idea (that design can and does emerge from a process that is itself without a designer and without any awareness of any kind) overturns some deeply-held intuitions and cherished perspectives people have unthinkingly taken for granted throughout our history as a thinking, questioning species. Evolution has stunning implications for certain traditional musings about morality, the mind, religion, culture etc. In many cases the old ideas are invigorated by the dangerous idea that Darwin (and, to a lesser extent, Wallace) put forward and are strengthened. Other ideas dissolve in the 'universal acid' (Dennett's powerful image) and we are painstakingly shown how this is not a frightening notion that should lead to despair because the Darwinian replacements are often better than the pre-Darwinian inaccuracies. This is a stunning book for which the term 'food for thought' is an impoverished image: this is a feast for the mind."
44,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47362751-ville-kokko,5,"Dennett at his best. I would define the topic shortly as ""the philosophy of evolutionary biology"". Dennett goes through various aspects of evolutionary thinking and how they should really be understood. A major theme is how evolutionary explanations can account for just about all the different aspects of humanity and the world in which we live now; how all these amazing things around and in us really can have emerged from something simpler. In practice, this means answering a lot of critics who want to insert hidden miracles to explain this or that thing. Dennett's way of going through all this is impressive: his argumentation is compelling and clear, and you can see the depth and breadth of background knowledge behind it stretching far into the distance.This book is great for the scientific understanding of evolution. It is also more than that. I wish people were not so threatened by this vision of the universe giving birth to us without mysterious intervention, in steps that we can (somewhat) understand. I personally feel that this makes us much more parts of the universe than stories relying in miracles and unexplained absolute values."

This was a long detailed book, and at sometimes too detailed. Dennett wanted to show how a good idea could become a dangerous idea out of fear, incomprehension, and downright refusal to accept what is right before your eyes.Through it all, I have ended with a few great quotes that I can use the next time someone tells me I am wrong, or it is heresy to think this way.

56,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44383006-adrian,4,"I will lay my cards out on the table. I am an absolute believer in the Big Bang and in the neo-Darwinist explanation for how the splendiferous variety of organisms came to exist on this planet. For me, this means that I am a card-carrying atheist. (I went through a religious phase when I was an impressionable teenager, so I think I can say that I gave religion a fair go.) As a professional scientist, I have seen how careful experimental design can be used to gain a clearer understanding of some of the basic processes that underlie the complexities of the real world around us. But I also have tremendous sympathy for those who feel that “reductionistic” science can, if we're not careful, somehow devalue what seems most important to us as humans. After all, as a boy, I was privileged to have several opportunities to sing as a chorister in some of the most atmospheric and soul-inspiring cathedrals that can still be admired in England today, and I can still be tremendously moved by even just the thought of some of the beautiful music and architecture that humans have been able to create.In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett uses the metaphor of cranes and skyhooks. Cranes are realistic pieces of theory that can lift us up from a ground level of ignorance to enable us to understand something as amazing as how we as organisms could possibly have come to exist on this planet. A skyhook, however, is a fantasy device that tries to hook into thin air in order to attempt to pull us up to an equivalent level of understanding. This might sound like a rather supercilious designation for Dennett to use to praise the hard-working cranes invoked by evolutionary scientists and to disparage the skyhooks used by creationists. In fact, it seems to me that Dennett tries to be extremely careful throughout this book not to alienate anyone unnecessarily. And he does thoroughly rebuke what he calls “greedy” reductionism: the attempt to explain everything not only without skyhooks but without taking the trouble to build up cranes either (think B.F.Skinner and pop sociobiology).Throughout, Dennett presents a gloriously logical and carefully nuanced argument for Darwin's “dangerous idea.” Along the way, he provides overviews and opinions about contributions from such original thinkers as Stuart Kauffman, who emphasizes self-organizing principles in nature, Noam Chomsky, with his views on seemingly non-evolved innate language capabilities in humans, and Roger Penrose's belief that human intelligence is superior to AI in somehow being able to circumvent the limitations of Godel's theorems. Dennett vigorously defends a careful use of adaptationist thinking, and challenges the concerns notably expressed by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. Above all, he demonstrates, like Richard Dawkins, an unshakeable belief that the truth about evolution is in fact ultimately more beautiful (and certainly more satisfying) than most forms of religious faith. Both of these thinkers tend to be wilfully misunderstood by their intellectual opponents. In this book, Dennett makes it abundantly clear that he considers that the evolution of the human brain should be considered as a completely new phase of evolution, since the ability to manipulate symbols and to spread memes (if you will) changes everything. In the hands of a humanist as profound as Dennett, Darwin's idea remains “dangerous” indeed to any sort of religious fundamentalism, but Dennett quite clearly sees no need to throw the baby out with the bath-water. To accept that we evolved through a mechanism in which nature can often be rightly viewed as “red in tooth and claw” does not lead to any ethical nihilism. And from the premise that we evolved through the operation of a mindless algorithmic process, it does not follow that life is without meaning."
57,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90186128-clyde-macalister,5,"One should treat this book as an ""advanced introduction"" to the subject of Darwinism. I would thus begin by recommending to any newcomers to the subject that one read a few other, easier introductions to evolution before reading this one, such as The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution by Richard Dawkins, Why Darwin Matters by Michael Shermer, Why Evolution Is True by Jerry Coyne, and Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think about Our Lives by David Sloan Wilson. Darwin's Dangerous Idea often goes into heavy detail in its analysis and application of Darwinian concepts, thereby justifying any decision to read these other works first.The book establishes as its thesis that one ought to view the evolution as an unconscious algorithmic process, and that by doing so, one vastly improves the insights and epistemic utility of evolutionary theory with respect to the analysis of a wide range of other subjects. That is, since it is a philosophical, instead of a strictly scientific, book, Dennett extends the conclusions of evolutionary thinking to a broader range of subjects than what one typically identifies in evolutionary literature, including such subjects as cosmology, cosmogony, physics, and even AI.Dennett surveys for his readers other, standard principles of modern Darwinian theory, and then applies such principles to the examination of such topics as the meaning of life and other long-cherished aspects of human existence, showing that Darwinian theory does not destroy the notions we cherish about our existence, but rather, further reinforces and clarifies them. For example, it has always struck me as evident that a materialist worldview, such as that held by the consistent Darwinian, does not preclude such metaphysical possibilities as a meaningful existence (e.g. ""Doesn't the view that no Supreme Architect consciously creates and governs the universe foster cynicism or nihilism?""), but Dennett strengthens the point in novel ways that would not have necessarily occurred to me.He furthermore dwells heavily on the theme that the Darwinian thinker should not generally attempt to devise alternative explanations to natural selection to explain adaptive features of life, and that all attempts to do so have failed. The quest to find such exceptions by thinkers within evolutionary biology has often proved a greater hindrance to progress in evolutionary science than the attacks of the more ""pure"" creationists outside of evolutionary science. Dennett exemplifies this unfortunate tendency by critically addressing the thought and pronouncements of ""inconsistent evolutionist"" thinkers, such as Stephen Jay Gould and Noam Chomsky.I will not go so far as to claim that there aren't small bits in the book here and there I find objectionable, but they do not lessen the strength of its thesis and are close enough to trivial that I see no reason to lessen my five-star review of the work on the whole."
58,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9098678-scott-holstad,3,"I have to admit that I feel guilty every time I read Dennett. Simply put, of the infamous Four Horsemen, he is by far my least favorite. I know I'm *supposed* to like him. I respect his opinions and ideas. He''s a gifted thinker. Maybe it simply boils down to I think he's NOT a gifted writer - particularly when compared to his three peers. He frankly just bores the shit out of me. He can take any topic, an interesting one such as this book's thesis, and make it so fucking boring I just want to yawn and fall asleep, while Hitchens slays me, Dawkins educates and challenges me, and Harris goes to interesting places in a very reader-friendly style. And you know, I've read a HELL of a lot of philosophy and science and religion over my decades of life and one could probably pick a number of ""boring"" writers out from among the lot, but many of them stimulate my intellect. Dennett does neither, at least not in a very impressive or outstanding fashion. I just think he's ... mediocre. Average. Can't carry his weight compared to the other three, let alone other recent and contemporary philosophers. He occasionally writes on important and intriguing topics. Sadly, nearly any other writer of stature would likely do a much better job of it. Subjective, yes, but then isn't every book review merely one's opinion, and as such, I'm entitled to mine. I had a lot of professors in the various universities I attended who knew their stuff, were SMEs, far above me quite often, but even so, quite a large number -- having to ""publish or perish"" -- couldn't write worth shit. I earned several degrees and studied for more in other fields AND I taught at several universities and I'll tell you this -- not only do they not require academics to take advanced or professional or academic or ANY writing classes in grad school, but they don't even teach them how to fucking TEACH! Sure, I took pedagogy classes in grad school, but that's theory and it's not remotely practical once you get in a large classroom facing tons of students representing more than two dozen languages. At that point, one realizes they probably know THEIR stuff, but they're not prepared to teach it, nor are they prepared to write about it in an officially ""academic"" manner. The difference is, some can pull one or both off and many can't. Dennett strikes me as someone who fits the latter description and I'd wager that's true and realistic. I don't doubt his intellect. I doubt his ability to effectively and intelligently communicate what it produces. Dawkins is an example of someone who has gone much further in his abilities to do so considering it's highly likely he fits the standard model of preparation at writing for publication - he's learned to be effective, intelligent, knowledgable, and interesting. Dennett has not, which is a pity because I believe I'd gain a lot hearing him give a lecture. Book? Cautiously recommended at best..."
59,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7724604-lenny-ankireddi,4,"This lengthy and thought-provoking book by Dan Dennett is more a treatise on Darwinian thought than a commentary on the Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. It highlights and discusses the many offshoots of thought relating to reductionism, utilitarianism, Kantism and many other lines of philosophical rumination when considered in the light of Darwinian principles of the evolution of living organisms, the algorithmic nature of the existence of such and the anatomical and behavioral traits they possess and display. This commentary on the interpretations over time by many celebrated and infamous luminaries of the fields of philosophy, biology - evolutionary and sociobiology and other thought leaders includes the reflections of Darwin himself and dwells on the fallacies and incongruencies of thought committed by the experts, that resulted from either limited or incomplete knowledge or the inability to logically and consistently articulate the meaning of Darwinian existence and its implications on human existence.Dennett is clearly an adherent to the ideas formulated by Richard Dawkins in ""The Selfish Gene"" and to those that have read Dawkins' work and tend to understand and agree with his take on the prime replicator and therefore, the prime benefactor of utility, it is not hard to see the philosophical scaffolding that Dennett builds around these ideas to support his arguments. Dennett spends a considerable amount of page real estate identifying why Darwin's idea is considered so dangerous by so many who are wedded to a traditionalist or exceptionalist interpretation of the meaning of human life and how it stands apart from the meaning of other forms of life. In doing so, he focuses special energy in lambasting Stephen Jay Gould for his insistence on factors other than natural selection leading to selection and goes into many examples why Gould's instances for what he, Gould, presented as new and revolutionary ways of understanding evolution, in reality, fit very well into the well known picture of natural selection as supported by John Maynard Smith.The text gets a little circumloquacious in places and there is a constant reference to sky-hooks and cranes that if you didn't really get the analogy for the first time it is introduced in the book, you may find hard to fit into the picture in the scores of other places where they are mentioned. There is also the usual philosophical abstraction of thought in many places that is hard for someone who deals more in concrete ideas to follow. However, the book is a prolific provider of fodder for thought and presents many ideas that one may have considered before but not in a certain way that would yield different results or confuse them more. Overall, a long and arduous but decent read."

Mother Nature is the blind watch-maker, and Dennett shows us how (via Darwinism) ""Design"" can arise from ""Order"". Biology is then reduced to engineering, with a myopic ""Tinkerer"". Apparent design, intentionality at one level can be made with mindless automatons at lower levels.The ""dangerousness"" of Darwinism comes when these ideas are applied to the human species. If we really are just another ""node"" on the Tree of Life, wouldn't life be devoid of meaning and morality? Many challenges have been thrown at (orthodox) Darwinism, including: panspermia, intergalactic gene-splicers, multiple origins of life and Lamarckism. These have all been refuted, strengthening Darwinism in the process.The last place for a skyhook, some intrinsic uniqueness of human beings, would be the human mind. Dennett explores Dawkin's notion of memes, culture, and how these interplay with genes and development to create complex human intellect. But is there anything that really separates human mind from the other animals'? Dennett argues that there is no skyhook for the human mind, but cranes generating cranes generating cranes. Some quantum theories attempt to re-introduce a ""skyhook"", but this in itself is reductio ad absurdum with Godel's second incompleteness theorem: if Design Space is an evolutionary algorithm, that generates a non-algorithmic brain, then that makes Design Space non-algorithmic (!). I can't see how this will ever work. I'm convinced that the brain is an algorithmic machine, with its own set of axioms and truth generator, but not infinitely so: there will be truths that the (a?) brain cannot prove.Some discussion in the end regarding the effects of Darwinism on social studies (quite a heated field, can ducks ""rape""?), ethics, and religion. Natural selection and evolution doesn't give answers to everything.I have a loonnggg ways to go to fully comprehending this book. Probably will take at least 2 more re-reads. Main points aside, Dennett has also shown me, a non-philosopher, non-scientist new terms and ways of thinking: the libraries of Babel/Mendel/Toshiba, simulations with ""Life Physics"", pruning the tree in ""Design Space"" and various philosophical thought experiments.For me, this was definitely an enlightening but rather difficult read. Wasn't impossible though, I think Dennett should be one of the more accessible philosophers to read. Great book!"
61,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4304479-iain,4,"""Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life' (1995) by Daniel Dennett is a remarkable book dealing with a complex concept, evolutionary biology, from a non-scientist approach. An eminent professor of Philosophy, Dennett, brings the sprinkles of humanities based arguments to this grand idea. The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. Dennett makes this case on the basis that natural selection is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the evolution of life. The book often cites Richard Dawkins, as it should, who puts Darwin' theory quite succinctly by saying, “The one thing that makes evolution such a neat theory is that it explains how organized complexity can arise out of primeval simplicity.” This is one of the key strengths of Darwin’s idea, and the key weakness of the alternatives."" Dennett takes particular aim at two prominent figures in Stephen Jay Gould and Noam Chomsky (who seems to be able to end up in any academic debate) which provides for stimulating reading. In the end, I feel Darwin's dangerous idea does prevail. A guiding principle...“If you want to teach your children that they are the tools of God, you had better not teach them that they are God's rifles, or we will have to stand firmly opposed to you: your doctrine has no glory, no special rights, no intrinsic and inalienable merit. If you insist on teaching your children false-hoods—that the Earth is flat, that ""Man"" is not a product of evolution by natural selection—then you must expect, at the very least, that those of us who have freedom of speech will feel free to describe your teachings as the spreading of falsehoods, and will attempt to demonstrate this to your children at our earliest opportunity. Our future well-being—the well-being of all of us on the planet—depends on the education of our descendants.”An excellent book. "
62,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63384722-alex,5,"This is the first book by Daniel Dennett I have read, and what a beast of a book! Dennett has successfully pushed me to new levels of mental exhaustion with Darwin’s Dangerous Idea. The idea is that in setting out to explain the origin of species, Darwin described natural selection as a mindless, purposeless, mechanical process. In other words, an algorithm that can explain all the Design in the universe through gradual accumulations over a very long time. He calls it a Universal Acid:“It eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognizable, but transformed in fundamental ways.”The traditional western philosophical idea that Mind (an intelligent creator or God) is required to make a mind, with God being the ultimate source of design, is turned on its head by Darwin’s “inversion of reasoning” that Design can emerge via a mindless algorithmic process that doesn’t require any pre-existing Mind.So, Dennett sets the stage for Darwin’s dangerous idea in Part I. Part II turns to biology to look at the controversies within the discipline that have arisen to challenge Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis. He then applies Darwin’s idea on humans in Part III, arguing that the origins of human culture, language, consciousness and morality must be explained through evolutionary processes.Much of the book (especially Parts II & III) consists of refuting the ideas and arguments of other thinkers. Although a background knowledge of the people he critiques is not necessary, familiarity with the work of Gould, Penrose, Chomsky and Nietzsche would probably provide a more fulfilling reading experience. On that note, if you’re looking for an introductory book to evolutionary theory, this is not the place to start. I’d recommend Richard Dawkins’ The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design (which itself is frequently referenced in this book), then come back to Dennett.Some of my favourite parts included the concepts of cranes and skyhooks, and Dennett’s autonomous robot thought experiment which is programmed to protect a cryogenic chamber of your frozen body into the future. Steven Pinker’s endorsement “Essential and pleasurable for any thinking person” on the front cover is an accurate description of this challenging book. Dennett is a compelling intellectual and I’m looking forward to reading his other work."
63,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500829-chris,4,"Dennett's analysis of Darwin's idea is very well written, thorough, and thought provoking. He also writes in an accessible way, which is a refreshing change of pace from other philosophic texts. In fact, I would argue that there is no better argument for Darwinism's validity from a reductionist point-of-view. But that's also my criticism. Despite claiming that he's not an atomistic reductionist, he is an algorithmic reductionist. This is a valid claim, but it leaves out any possibility of tautology. Indeed, that is the one part of the book I took issue with. After reducing Darwinism all the way to the fundamental laws of the universe, one could still ask, ""Why does anything exist?"" Instead of diving into this problem with the thoroughness with which he delves into the others, he simply cites another book, claiming it reaches the conclusion that the question can't be asked, and then moves on. In this way, it feels incomplete. On the positive side, it is incredibly well researched. Dennett has obviously been thinking about Darwinism for a very long time, and has an unparalleled command of the literature surrounding it. Definitely worth a read if you're interested in the subject matter."
64,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,3,"The excellently titled Darwin’s Dangerous Idea is directed both at the educated laymen and professional academics to “get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary theory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens.""As a piece of pop-science/philosophy, I found it dense and sometimes abstruse, with sections filled with jargon. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are (at least) familiar with more accessible stuff by Dawkins and Gould. That said, Dennett invokes some quite illustrative metaphors. First, the consequences of the explanatory power of Darwinism are described as universal acid: alluding to his childhood imagination of acid so potent it corrodes everything it touches. Another useful concept he describes, is what he coins as skyhooks: ideas essentially invoking miracles to explain an aspect of design, life, or meaning. Dennett criticises eminent scientists such as Chomsky, Lewontin, and Gould for falling into this trap and persuasively argues that Darwinism, as a universal acid, dissolves the need for skyhooks as explanations. "
65,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69860526-k,3,"3-1/2 stars. Really strong beginning, really strong closing, and really long and dense in-between. On this subject matter, there is an unfortunate amount of preaching to the choir. Dennett is sensitive to this and, for a small audience of highly intelligent fence-sitters, he might nab a few converts. For the rest of us willing to tackle this book, his intellectual arguments are novel and stimulating. His background and approach are more from philosophy than from biology, and that may have contributed to my finding his writing less accessible than Pinker's or Dawkins's. But not impenetrable; his style lacks Gould's high-brow, intellectual jibber-jabber. A lot of the book is critique of the arguments of other researchers and writers, as if its great length was intended to build up his team's defensive arsenal in a long-standing feud with an opposing team of intellectuals that lack the capacity and imagination to accept that Darwinian evolution adequately explains everything without ""resorting to skyhooks"", to use a Dennett favorite, or what I call ""hand-waving"". I was sufficiently challenged with this book. I enjoyed a lot of it but found it tedious at times."

Daniel Dennett presents a how a 'mindless algorithmic process' - evolution has brought us here, through water-tight reasoning (examining different hypothesis, contradictions), drawing heavily on the research in the domain and beautiful thought experiments. This quote from the book aptly describes the contents of it:""An impersonal, unreflective, robotic, mindless little scrap of molecular machinery is the ultimate basis of all the agency and hence meaning, and hence consciousness, in the universe."""

Not having the meme of evolution as a basis for thought really hindered many pre-Darwinian thinkers into doing mental gymnastics around the ideas of purpose, creation, and ethics.Dennett also presents many of the current hot topics in evolutionary biology and philosophy and while interesting, a lot of his descriptions fall back on his philosophical first-principle analysis which can be quite dense. This book is very accessible, however a degree or two less of bedrock philosophy would've bumped this one up a star for me."

Regardless, I like to exercise my mind, and this was certainly a workout for me.It seems unhelpfully verbose and obscure at times. I'm not entirely certain who Dennett is trying to convince, but most folks are going to struggle to understand this. I did on numerous occasions, and I'm pretty sure I agree with him. At least, I agree with the bits I understood.Also, did Gould fuck his wife or something?

It was not very interesting to me, nor do I think it remains very valuable with regards to evolutionary theory. The rest of the book contains some very satisfying introduction to AI. This is also not very relevant today but as a snapshot in history it is enjoyable to see the kind of approach Dennett believed was necessary to convince his readers. The approach is simple but exhaustive. The quarter machine, repurposed into a Panamanian Balboa detecting machine was an especially captivating section. Overall I don’t believe this book is a good source of information if you are curious about the science of evolution, but it is interesting and important as an historical work. "

In the process, he presents carefully constructed, thoroughly logical arguments refuting some prevalent misconceptions regarding evolution set forth by eminent scientists and thinkers, including Noam Chomsky (who argued against the evolution of language) and Roger Penrose (who put forth some rather interesting but undersupported ideas about the origins of consciousness.)I highly recommend this book, but with the warning that it is quite dense and should be allotted significant time to do it justice."

With that said, this work really comes into its own in the third part. Even if you don't read the rest of this book, the third part is worth reading on its own. But I would recommend reading the whole thing. You will be challenged, you will be pleased, and you will come away with an fascinating new understanding of evolution and the role it plays in helping us answer some of the biggest questions."

It seems not to be the purpose of the author and neither should anyone get angry or feel as if Darwin or Dennet consider believers stupid or unworthy. This is just one form of adaptation..."

The author Daniel Dennett has approached Darwin's theory from a philosophical perspective. According to him, Darwin’s idea overturned everything people thought about the natural world. Challenging many people's ideas about how the world began was a dangerous idea. The metaphors used by the author to fortify his arguments for defending Darwinism are quite interesting. You agree with Dennett's conclusions or not, the book certainly is a good food for thought. "

But, come on, you can only blanche at the Epstein-iness of the citations (Pinker, Minsky, oh my) and the cringey-ness of that late-Clinton, early-Bush anti-Theist Brights high-horsedness. Truly a testament of it times, as well as in the emphasis in AI. Oh well, interesting shit on the Baldwin Effect and determining the correct level of Darwinian reductionist to be (not Skinner, mind you!)."

First section, placing DDI in the context of western philosophical tradition and explaining core principles of Darwinism, was brilliant. Second section, taking up discrete critiques of/challenges to Darwinism, was far too inside baseball for me. Third section, developing a moral philosophy and/or theory of meaning consistent with/based on Darwinism, was interesting but not entirely satisfying or convincing."

There are concepts that are explained that are difficult to understand and outside of the experience of lowly little ol' me, but it was worth it.The fourth horseman of atheism has put together a compelling argument for Darwin and against organized religion as a source of history, science or logic."

The chapters on 1990-era AI were a bit of a slog, and I still don't know what Stephen Jay Gould did to Dennett to merit so many attacks."
80,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23664697-matt-gold,4,"Good stuff! ^o^ - It's Darwinism explored from the viewpoint of a philosopher! - Dennett is basically a factory for creating useful devices that help you structure the way you think about the world. Not so good stuff.. >_< - Just awful editing, pacing, etc... had the same issues with another one of Dennett's books so I'm starting to think this is just how he writes. - So freaking long! (see above)"
81,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11166290-bob-gustafson,2,This is a scholarly book written by Daniel Dennett for other scholars. I am not a scholar and it was more work than I was willing to do to keep track of all the cited scholars and their arguments. It you are a scholar you would probably rate it differently.
82,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67939328-mgrdich-minasian,4,You don't expect to learn evolutionary biology Darwinian way of thinking from a philosopher but somehow in an amazing way Dennet does it representing all the aspect of this particular way of thinking in every aspect possible. And i should definitely re read it again in the near future .
83,068482471X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716719-william,3,"Somewhat less readable than Dennett's other books because of its dense references, this book helps very much to explain why people are still unable to receive Darwin's wisdom after all these years."
