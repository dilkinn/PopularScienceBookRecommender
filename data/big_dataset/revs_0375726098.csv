0,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,5,"Fascinating! Who would have thought you could find out so many things in a book of nothing!The book explains, in a compelling and readable way, every angle of the concept of nothing, or rather from whence the difficulties comprehending it arise.I found it captivating to read and learn how the ancient Greeks' demand for logical consistency of their concepts prevented them to invent the useful mathematical zero symbol and how the theological disputes about the reality of a physical equivalent to zero – a vacuum – stimulated the mathematician Torricelli, Galileo's student, to use mercury in order to remove air from a glass tube, thereby constructing creating a sustained physical vacuum for the first time. As for the more recent scientific approach to the deeper paradox of whether there could exist a physical Nothing, I found Barrow's explication spellbinding. His presentation of the Casimir effect is the best I've read so far and I really liked his explication of ''why there is something rather than nothing'', namely that the idea of the void and of nothingness or empty space violates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. So, it seems there cannot be such thing as ''nothing''. Rather, the vacuum is merely the lowest energy state available and it presents itself as the lambda force (the Einstein's cosmological constant).I also found Barrow's explanations of the symmetry breaking, the unification of the three forces (excluding gravity) at ultra-high temperatures/energies as well as his explications of what is known as the cosmological 'inflation' much clearer than in other popular science books I've read.And there is much more in this book than I can mention in my review. Go and read it!"

2,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,3,"Quantum physics, if it is real, requires that there be no such thing as nothing. Ergo, nothing is real. And maybe, even, everything is nothing. And John D. Barrow gets 3 stars instead of 4 for assuming I already had six Ph.D's by the time I decided to read this book. (Did anybody read Impossibility: The Limits of Science and the Science of Limits? Yeah. Exactly.) And despite the fact that I didn't understand the majority of what he was saying (though I did feel a wisp of air over my head at times, and that's close), I thought The Book of Nothing was fascinating and hard to put down. It did kind of reinforce my neophytic theory that quantum physics may well be little more than pseudo-religious philosophy with fancy math attached. But it also made me jealous that even if people like Barrow can't speak my language (words, sentences, etc.), for better or worse, he gets to speak the language of ""God"" (math, numbers, decimals, assorted bits of what looks like Latin). All of it in an effort to partially explain man's long and complicated relationship with the concept of ""nothing"" (re: ""irony""), and how modern cosmology is changing that conception (re: ""cosmic irony""). The philosophical implications of this book led me toward my own rather brilliant thought experiments in alcohol mixing and binge drinking, and I shall forever be in Barrow's debt for a particular weekend in late 2006. I don't think I had the reaction Barrow was hoping for, and in fact, I'm pretty sure I'm not even a part of his intended audience. Frankly, his work is out of my league and doesn't translate well into my language (Idiot). But it was fascinating, nonetheless, and there is no way to read this book and not find yourself spending a lot of time... thinking.NC"
3,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," John D. Barrow is one of my favorite writing scientists. He seems to have read everything. His books are filled with witty allusions that lighten up the deep concepts he covers. He has tackled philosophy of mathematics, cosmology, physics, philosophy, logic and does so with panache. His books are always interesting with a light and breezy style yet digs deep into mysterious and concepts which stretch the faculties. This book on the concept of nothing is no exception. He covers this idea which shows up in the vacuum of physics, the zero of mathematics and void of philosophy and religion and shows how rich and multifaceted nullity can be. I read this book several times over the years and always find something new."

7,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Barrow, John D. Book of Nothing, The: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas about the Origins of the Universe (2000)How nothing became something""Nothing is Real."" --The Beatles, ""Strawberry Fields Forever""As quoted by Professor Barrow on page 8, this is a pun on what the Beatles had in mind, and is in essence what this book is all about. Nothing is real in the sense that it is no longer the nothing that it once was. It is actually ""something."" On the next page, to further illustrate the point, Barrow quotes the lyric from Freddie Mercury (of Queen), ""Nothing really matters."" It does indeed!The impetus for this, Barrow's latest book on cosmology, seems to be the growing realization that the vacuum of space (""nothing"") is not entirely empty, and in fact cannot in principle ever be empty. As Barrow explains in Chapter 7, ""The Box that Can Never Be Empty,"" it would be a violation of the Uncertainty Principle because, ""If we could say that there were no particles in a box, that it was completely empty of all mass and energy,"" we would have ""perfect information about motion at every point and about the energy of the system at a given instant of time"" (p. 204). This rather simple, but shocking revelation, has consequences that are shaking the very foundation of our understanding of the cosmos. Quite simply it appears that there is no such thing as nothing.Barrow lays the ground work for this revelation by first exploring the nature of nothing as seen by the ancients, noting in particular the Greek abhorrence of the very idea that the vacuum could exist (""horror vacui""). In Chapter One, ""Zero - The Whole Story,"" (which follows Chapter Nought) he recalls the history of zero and how it finally found acceptance. So great was the Greek horror of nothing that they did not have a zero in their number system. Many people found the idea of nothing and of zero frightening and impious. However, as Barrow shows, eventually zero triumphed over its adversaries because of its usefulness. In the next chapter, ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" Barrow recalls the medieval debates about the vacuum, whether it exists, whether it existed before the creation of the world, and whether it was possible to create a vacuum. He recounts attempts to create a vacuum in Chapter Three, ""Constructing Nothing,"" and then discusses the once and future ether that Einstein had so completely demolished. (It's back! But it's called the vacuum and it seems to have more properties than the old ether ever had.) In Chapter Five, ""Whatever Happened to Zero?"" Barrow explores some non-Euclidian geometries and shows how numbers are created out of the empty set in set theory, a neat ironic analogy to how universes are perhaps created out of the vacuum.Beginning in Chapter Six, ""Empty Universes,"" Barrow concentrates on cosmology. I have to warn you that, despite Professor Barrow's elegant and graceful style and an abundance of charts, sidebars, lively quotes, and illustrations, this is not an easy read. The subject at the level Barrow wants to discuss it, is quite frankly very difficult. I have followed cosmology as a hobby for many years, but I am not a physicist or a mathematician. Those who are will probably have an easier time of it. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from this book and if I had wanted to ""study"" the text, could have learned a lot more. One thing I did not learn, something I have yet to find in any book on cosmology, is an answer to the question, What is the source of the energy that drives the expansion of the universe? Or put another way, what caused the singularity to ""explode""? (Any reader know the answer?)Barrow shows that one of the things that recent cosmology has done to the Big Bang universe that was said to contain all of space and time (leaving no possibility for ""nothing"" or ""anything"" to exist ""outside"" of it since there was no outside) is to allow it to be part of a larger, possibly infinite universe. The idea that our universe may be but one of an infinite number of universes all popping probabilistically out of the vacuum is mind boggling beyond any ability to describe it. In reference to the possible eternal expansion of our particular universe, Barrow notes on page 300 that ""When there is an infinite time to wait then anything that can happen, eventually will happen."" Applying this deduction to that possible infinity of universes, one finds a companion to the ""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a new universe is created with every quantum event, a companion that asserts that in an infinite universe every possible event will take place, and every thought unthought will eventually be thought, that indeed there are unicorns somewhere and politicians who don't lie, and a place where bread always lands butter side up.Faced with this whimsy, I suspect that Barrow would quickly point out that that is why in physics when infinities come up in the equations, it is a sure sign that something is wrong. Nevertheless, the cosmos as revealed by modern astronomy, astrophysics, relativity, quantum mechanics, and the ideas from string theory, is a story of breathtaking and mind boggling sweep and grandeur, often totally unintuitive and beyond our wildest imaginings. As picturesque, inventive and psychologically satisfying as the tales of the ancients about the cosmos are (e.g., "" It's turtles all the way down!"") they pale beside the conception of the universe as seen by modern science. Professor Barrow is one of the very best at bringing this vision to lay readers, and The Book of Nothing is not to be missed."
8,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130656-abbey,3,"Well researched and engagingly written, although apparently John Barrow's research did not extend to ensuring that his mental health metaphors were accurate. He refers to the nature of light as being schizophrenic, which is very puzzling because I'm pretty sure light doesn't suffer from delusions or hallucinations. I suspect he actually meant to cite DID - Dissociative Identity Disorder (what used to be known as Multiple Personality Disorder), but I really don't see why mental health analogies are appropriate in a book about science anyway."
9,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5315364-dr-matt,3,"Interesting book. Good writing. The author has a workable grasp of ancient history which allows him to set a broader and more informative basis for his topic than is usually done by most scientists writing books for popular consumption. As usual however, this author is on strongest ground when speaking about science, not religion or philosophy. It is unfortunately part of the maddening hubris of scientists ( of which I am one) that while they would be horrified at the prospect of a self- taught science buff with little more than a smattering of classes in physics presuming he/she could adequately explain the issues of modern day cosmology and quantum theory, these same academics see no problem when they start making philosophical and theological pronouncement s that belie a serious lack of any kind of advanced knowledge of theology or philosophy (which I also have).With that caveat, an interesting book on the scientific implications of the vacuum. It's value outside that realm is hardly adequate."
10,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12115505-mona-m-abd-el-rahman,4,"The Book of Nothing begins with a charming overview of the historical development of the number zero. Although the cipher figure was invented independently among a number of primitive civilizations, it was the Indians who gave it its additive value that enabled the emergence of the decimal system. Curiously, Barrow points out the only civilizations that invented the zero were all highly superstitious practitioners of mysticism. The Indians, for example, also associated the digit with a number of religious and philosophical themes of nothingness. Conversely, the ancient greeks, who were otherwise the most scientifically significant early civilization, could not tolerate the idea of zero. For the greek philosophers, the concept of a cipher was logically dissonant, as encapsulated by Parmenides’ maxim, ex nihilo nihil fit (nothing comes from nothing), or Aristotle’s “Nature abhors a vacuum”.As the ancient philosophers argued over the unsettled debate on how something can come out of nothing, the concept of zero gained prominence in the realm of literature and theology in the following millenium. While writers like Shakespeare made the best out of innocuous puns and wordplay on nothing (e.g. his prominent comedy “Much Ado About Nothing”), theologians faced a significant challenge on the philosophical implications of nothing; if a vacuum could exist, it would disprove the omnipresence of God. As the feud between theologians, philosophers and scientists escalated towards the end of the middle ages, interest in the ancient engineering challenge of creating a vacuum revived. By the mid 1600s, the first vacuum pump -the Magdeburg hemispheres– was invented by Otto von Guericke and memorably demonstrated with the failure of 32 horses to pull it apart, highlighting the power of atmospheric pressure. At about the same time, Blaise Pascal began his experiments in measuring air pressure. The results dealt a significant blow to the church – as air pressure decreased proportionately with height above sea level, one could extrapolate the measurements to postulate that there exists a certain point above earth where air pressure was zero. This dark chasm, which we know now as space, shattered any beliefs of an infinite extension of the earth’s dominion.But, as Barrow notes, the concept of vacuum would undergo several more cycles of derision and revival among the scientific elite as scientific revolutions come and go. The first major effort to develop a coherent picture of the vacuum came after Newton. While Newtonian physics were astoundingly successful in predicting a wide variety of physical phenomena (on a human scale), physicists struggled with the idea of planets exerting gravitational forces over vast distances of empty space. In order to explain physical actions in the absence of mass and energy, the ether was created an elusive substance thought to permeate the universe. This was, of course, debunked with the advent of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. With this, the ether retired and the vacuum assumed another period of scientific dormancy.Though it is foreseeable that more technically-minded readers will find the entire first half of the book – dedicated to the history of the vacuum – as somewhat incoherent and even tiring (Barrow has been rather ambitious in attempting to weave the philosophical, literary, theological, historical, and scientific elements of the concept of nothing into a seamless story), it provides a fun warm-up for the more generalist reader in making a transition into the much more dense second half of the book. The last half deals with the implications of the latest discoveries in quantum mechanics and astrophysics on the nature of the spatial vacuum. Here, the explanations are about as lucid as those found in Krauss’s A Universe From Nothing.As Barrow skillfully narrates, the latest conundrum on the vacuum began almost a century ago when Einstein arbitrarily added a ‘cosmological constant’ to one of his field equations that would result in a static universe. By 1929, Hubble discovered the expansion of the universe, shattering the image of an unmoving universe. Einstein later lamented to George Gamow that the cosmological constant was the biggest blunder of his life. However, the 1998 discovery that the universe is not only expanding, but that its expansion is also accelerating, resurrected conjectures on the nature of the vacuum. As it turns out, even if one removes every single bit of mass-energy that it is possible to remove from a spatial region, what remains is not an absence of energy, but the lowest state of energy possible. This vacuum energy, an innate feature of space itself, acts as an anti-gravitational force that speeds up the expansion of the universe and is set to become the dominant force in the universe someday as space grows forever. Cosmological constant has been currently used to explain vacuum energy, perhaps Einstein’s ‘biggest blunder’ (though wrongly applied) was really just an amazing prediction!"
11,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69936737-szabolcs-sebesty-n,4,"Imagine that you have to write a 300-page book about nothing. It's not an easy task, is it? Well, John D. Barrow, an English cosmologist did it. He studies nothing from different angles. He starts with the mathematical nothing: zero. Although nowadays the number zero is almost as natural to us as any other number, it wasn't the case before, and it took a couple of centuries for humanity to get used to it.Then he turns to the physical nothing: void. Rather than just addressing this question from the point of view of physics, Barrow also discusses nothing in literature and philosophy. It's a fascinating question what space is. Is it empty? Or does something fill it? For centuries people believed in ether, an invisible thing that fills space. Then came Einstein and showed that we don't need ether to understand physical phenomena.Barrow touches other interesting topics such as infinity, non-Euclidean geometry, and empty sets. And of course, no popular science book exists without talking about quantum physics, the most mysterious branch of physics. Barrow presents the most recent views of physicists regarding vacuum, which turns out to be more than nothing.Finally, the interesting question of creation. What does it mean that God created the world from nothing? And if we consider the Big Bang, is the singularity point nothing or something?An interesting book from a scholar, but it doesn't require a solid knowledge in mathematics or physics. In the end we wonder what an important role nothing plays in our lives, and what amount of human effort it generated over the centuries. Nice book, I recommend it."
12,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,2,"Really, really dry. Not quite sure how I finished the second half.___Numbers are humanity's greatest shared experience. The words may change, but the symbols stay the same.Where Western religious traditions sought to flee from nothingness, the use of the dot symbol for zero in meditative exercises showed how a state of non-being was something to be actively sought by Buddhists and Hindus in order to achieve Nirvana: oneness with the cosmos.The system of attributing a different value to a numeral depending on where it is located in a list was one of the greatest discoveries that humanity has ever made. Once made, it requires the invention of a symbol that signals that no value be attributed to an empty location in the list.The average density of the Universe (one atom per cubic meter of space) is a far better vacuum than we can make in any terrestrial laboratory by artificial means.All particles possess a wave-like aspect. They behave as waves with a wavelength that is inversely proportionate to their mass and velocity. When that quantum wavelength is much smaller than the physical size of the particle it will behave like a simple particle, but when its quantum wavelength becomes at least as large as the particle's size then wavelike quantum aspects will start to be significant.The quantum saves us from an irregularity of matter, since when electrons can only occupy particular energy levels, matter becomes stable and uniform.One of nature's deep secrets is the fact that the outcomes of the laws of Nature do not have to possess the same symmetries as the laws themselves. The outcomes are far more complicated, and less symmetrical, than the laws."

The book through it's ten chapters discusses topics like number system, discovery of zero, arguments about presence of ether, Einstein's famous equations,the cosmological constant, the inflation of universe induced by fluctuations in vaccum state, cosmic strings,the fate of the universe. The first eight chapters are really enjoyable, but the last two chapters are disappointing. The explanations are not clear or enough. In a place, a completely new term and a diagram without any reference to the previous or later texts have been introduced. You are fed fascinating facts, but the problem is it becomes more like a""10 facts about the universe"" rather than giving the explanations behind these happenings. I had to read and re-read the preceding paragraphs to know whether I have missed anything. The worst thing is that the first eight chapters set your expectation at a high level and when you will finally go through the last two chapters, you will know that this things are intersting and you want to know more about these topics, but the connections between the events are stated in such an incoherent manner that you feel frustrated and then bored even though the subject matter in hand is quite interesting."

One of my favorite ditties is included in it, from Hughes Mearns:""As I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there.He wasn't there again today,I wish, I wish he'd stay away.""Or the occasional deliberate use of a quote out of context. Consider Al Jolson's ""You ain't seen nothing yet""."

20,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7061202-adrian,3,"John D Barrow has essentially written a book in two parts, the first is a historical and (to a lesser extent) philosophical examination on the concept of nothing, and the second part is a cosmological examination of the cosmic vacuum and the inflationary universe.The title and the nature of the book cannot help but render an important question to the reader, namely, why? Why read this book? Indeed one could say that the title of the book is an almost suicidal approach to it's marketability, perhaps only eliciting the attention of those who are curious from an abstract perspective. Well, answering the question why is almost as difficult as explaining what is nothing, but here goes.Firstly, it touches on perhaps the most compelling ""why"" or rather ""how"", namely that there is something, rather than nothing, essentially the same approach implemented in many other works of cosmology. However, he explains the concept of nothing, or rather the human mind, and human civilization's difficulty comprehending it, with an immense readability.A main strength of Barrow's work is his ability to simplify rather complex scientific matters so that non-scientists such as myself can understand, and the result is a work on cosmology that is more readable than other authors out there, such as Lisa Randall and Brian Greene.Inevitably, new theories and breakthroughs are occurring all the time in the field of theoretical physics, but Barrow's book is still worth reading for those of us out there who either need their knowledge and understanding of theoretical physics and cosmology revising, or are intrigued by the first part of his book, the concept of nothing.John D Barrow has proved himself to be, at least through this book, both a cutting edge physicist and a highly readable author, and as such, his name will henceforth be a selling point, at least with this reader."

22,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,3,"This book is about the concept of nothing: it begins with the mathematical nothing, discussing the idea of zero and the various style of number systems including the familiar base-ten place-value system we use. It has a brief and lively discussion of the varieties of zeros (or identities under different operators) one may find in mathematics, and then on the philosophical and religious treatment of the idea of non-existence. The interesting part of the book concludes with physical nothingness, discussing the early history of the vacuum concept and of the ether. The rest of Barrow’s book plods on, though: after the introduction of Einstein’s astronomical bete noir, the lambda factor he used to try to maintain a constant universe, the book bogs down in discussions of astronomical structure, vacuum energy, expansion, inflation, and so on. These could be good topics, but they fail to enrich this book. Perhaps it’s the lack of technical precision making descriptions either vaguely non-committal or baffling, or perhaps it’s just not the right kind of book to expound these physical theories. Like Barrow’s “The Infinite Book”, which this precedes, each chapter and section has a nice quote from literature or pop culture, though these aren’t as good. My advice: read the first half if the topic interests you, and then stop as soon as you feel like it."
23,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12399516-matthew,5,"Nothing is a fascinating concept to us. The void, 0, or the vacuum were and are hotly debated and discussed topics in the study of mathematics and science. However, nothing's seemingly humble origins hold an amazing story. From the Indian mathematicians to the Grecian philosophers, many in the ancient world tried to define zero; however, the story goes deeper than that. In The Book of Nothing, by Professor John D. Barrow, Barrow explores the real story behind zero. He delves through ancient civilizations, debates from the 16th and 17th century, and finally discussions from the present era. He doesn't stop there, either, going through the exploration of vacuums and voids with complex science involved. Finally, he discusses the deeper meanings of the vacuum in our universe. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a long science read. This book talks about history as well, but later in the book focuses more on the science, which can get very dense at times. Its appeal mainly lies in the humorous writing style he uses, as well as the fancy scientific ideas and theories that are still useful today. However, the history is very interesting for people who want to read the little side notes and pictures included."
24,0375726098,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12399516-matthew,5,"Zero is one of the simplest mathematical concepts in the world to us today: it just represents nothing, null, emptiness. So what prevented ancient Greek mathematicians from coming up with zero and Europe from accepting the idea of zero for so long? And how did the ancients think of the vacuum - purely empty space? In John D. Barrow's science book, the Book of Nothing, he delves into these questions and explores the history of zero in ancient civilizations, explains its effects in societies, and even explains how vacuums and voids are shaping our idea of the origins of the universe today. It's an amazing read for anyone who is looking for a nice informational science read, and contains a lot of really interesting science info that, while hard to comprehend, is amazing and makes this book great."

In every few sentences the author mentioned ""nothing"" as if it were a human being that I ended up getting confused. John D. Barrow talked about his whole theory that nothing is actually something, but since nobody can see it or prove it it's considered nothing. That's basically said with three hundred eighty-something pages, scientific vocabulary, mayan theory, math, philosophy, physics (which confused the hell out of me), and cosmology. I wouldn't recommend it to be honest, maybe to a die-hard scientist but to a person who gets bored easily this would probably lead their brain to explode, because of nothing."

Starting at the concept of zero and the beginning of creation through the concept of a vacuum and a new anti-gravity force and minimum energy level that explains the creation, expansion, and final stages of the universe. Some novel concepts, at least to me. It is an older book (written 15 years ago). I'm out to find a more modern discussion of cosmology to see whether and how these theories are currently standing."
