0,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5," Science Is Messy... And Mostly Wrong There are several important conclusions for the layman to be drawn from Rippon’s well-written and rather more than merely comprehensive book. First, brains are incredibly complex organs which we in fact are only beginning to understand. Second, the purported differences in male and female brains are almost entirely mythical though claims about them persist in both professional and popular accounts. But for me the most interesting implication of her history of brain research is just how much fake news there is claiming to be science at any given time.The latest scientific results are typically taken as revelatory in brain research. Tests, measurements, and experiments correlate with some hypothesis which is considered as scientifically confirmed. The results are then reported and cited in various professional journals, thus providing credibility to the confirmation. This news then finds its way into the popular press as ‘established scientific findings,’ and becomes part of a type of scientific folklore. Like any other story, this new scientific ‘fact’ is verified by its sheer ubiquity - not just in professional and popular journals, but also on the worldwide web.Yet, when it comes to the brain, the results of almost all research are subsequently shown to be wrong. Errors in experimental design, researcher bias, spurious correlations, bogus references, among many other flaws seem almost de riguer in all research into the brain. Starting with cranial measurements in the 19th century, but continuing with high-tech MRI imaging, it seems that all the errors to be made have probably been made... and more than once. Sometimes the results of previous research can be re-interpreted in light of new findings; but, mostly, old research is simply intellectual junk.It might be argued that this is the way of science, and always has been, namely that the process of discovering the truth is necessarily messy, but that ultimately the right answers, or at least better ones, emerge from investigative chaos. Perhaps. But the problem is that there is a reticence to admit that the issue of junk science is permanently recurring. Every generation of scientific investigators believe that their results are closer to the truth than previous generations. Yet every previous generation has been shown to be profoundly misguided. Scientifically speaking, it seems a good bet that this generation will also shown to less competent than it now thinks it is. The vast bulk of its work will also be shown to be... well, bunk.In light of Rippon’s detailed and informed description of the actual process of science in an area of research which includes not just medicine and physical sciences like chemistry and developmental biology but also ‘softer’ disciplines like psychology and sociology, I wonder at those who think they have a solution to the problem of fake news in politics or business or technology. Most news is fake in the same sense that most scientific results are fake, that is future events will demonstrate that the conclusions we have reached on the information we have are mostly silly. Whatever consensus that exists now about what the truth is will be replaced by a different, often contradictory, consensus in the future.Only by convention do we dare term tomorrow’s consensus ‘progress.’ Progress is a criterion which means different things to different people. Consensus is such only among those who are part of the consensus, a self-defining and changeable mob. The specific criterion of progress probably changes as frequently as the results of the science involved. As indeed does the criterion of truth about the news of the day. Conditions change, interests change, economics change, all frequently as a result of what the news is, scientific or otherwise. Thus science itself is a sort of free for all in which the rules get made up as we go along. The closest relative to science is, perhaps surprisingly, literature. In fact science at its best seems to be a cadet branch of literature, modelled on literature in its attempt to describe, interpret and integrate what it sees in imaginative ways. Most literature turns out to be junk as well, fake news that ends up in discount shops and the remaindering warehouse. The only thing actually ‘better’ about modern literature over, say, that of Attic Greece is that there is lots more of it. Science, like literature, is inherently wasteful. But that’s what it takes to find out why they are done at all.Postscript 14May20: Here is another piece provided by a GR reader on the character of real science: https://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8591837..."

2,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10420932-alja,5,"""Brains reflect the lives they have lived, not just the sex of their owners."" Scientists have long tried to prove that men and women are inherently different because we have biologically different brains. The author reviews both the history and current-state research on sex differences, mainly in the field of neuroscience – the author's field of expertise – but also endocrinology and psychology. What we are now learning is that our brains are more plastic than previously thought and are profoundly shaped by experiences and messages they are exposed to. These findings imply that biological sex is just one of the variables that influence our brains, with the kind of toys we play with or praise we receive as children having a much more critical role than biology. However, what research is showing is that gender stereotypes have a negative influence on performance and self-esteem for women, and possibly even mental health. The author doesn't dismiss sex differences but instead suggests that it might be time to move beyond the binary categorization of sex and gender – which even genetically isn't as binary as we like to think – and challenge gender stereotypes to unleash the full potential of all humans.I imagine this book will be a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people, but I appreciated the level of detail and references it provides in terms of reviewing past and current research and theories. It also doesn't shy away from asking big questions that challenge our gender stereotypes. This book isn't the final destination; it's a starting point to a discussion that's still very much needed, even in the 21st century."

4,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"""It is clear that understanding the social brain could offer us a hugely effective lens to investigate how a gendered world can produce a gendered brain, how gender stereotypes are a very real brain-based threat that can divert brains from the endpoint they deserve.""This book is chock-full of information and analysis, covering broad ground in examining the current state of neuroscientific research, and the reporting of it, regarding gender and sex differences in the brain. I found the organisation chaotic and unhelpful for navigation - the start of the book has more opinion, less analysis, and many topics are touched upon in multiple places. It is worth the effort to persist though, as it is without question the richest book offered on this topic in a decade. I've covered only bits of it here, even in one of my longest reviews.Having said that, I've been brewing over the review for a while, given that - predictably - the responses have largely fallen into two camps, depending on where you sit in an old style dichotomy: are the gendered differences we see in society the result of our social construction, or do they come from our biology? This framing is increasingly frustrating, as it misses the biggest point of current research: that it indicates pathways to how we can change ourselves through our social worlds. This kind of research, far from simply allowing us to resolve arguments in old ways, gives us new tools to explore who we want to be.Unsurprisingly, perhaps, some of the richest contributions that Rippon makes is in chronicling the social construction of gender:	• We are social beings, whose brain development occurs within a social context and whose sense of 'self"" is inextricably tied to where we fit in our social world.	• Our social construction of gender starts very early, at least from birth. One of the powerful illustrations Rippon cites is that six-month olds react with surprise to an image of a man putting on lipstick. Only nine percent of three-year old boys in another test expressed a view that their fathers' would approve of playing with a doll. (Sixty-four percent of the father had said they would be comfortably buying one.)	• Caregivers to children display much stronger gender prejudice than they report. Gender prejudices among caregivers are measurably stronger than any behavioural gender differences among young children. This matches with research cited by Cordelia Fine that parents will inevitably list the traits that are ""gender-compliant"" in their children over those which are ""gender-deviant"", a kind of confirmation bias.	• We are deeply influenced by stereotypes. Stereotype threat is a clearly measurable phenomenon, and impairs performance of women and people of colour in alarming measure. If we believe that others think we will fail, chances are, we will.	• Children's developmental process involves using stereotype to determine their own behaviour. Children go through a strong gender policing stage - possibly strongest around 3 for girls - in which they will reject anything that does not fit with their concept of their own gender.The book also critiques - at length - studies into behavioural differences, variously debunking the difference (including by reference to stereotype threat) or by placing it within a social explanation. it is important to point out that all these reported differences are very small in ""real world"" terms, and overlapping, not exclusive. For example, gender height difference has had a effect size of 1.5. The strongest gender differences, usually cited as mental rotation skills (favouring males) and verbal skills (favouring females) come in at around 0.6. That is, a lot of men are going to be more verbal than the woman they are standing next to. It isn't enough to make it helpful to make assumptions about someone based solely on their gender. So, if you take the much-studied phenomenon of mental rotation, Rippon points out:	• Training and practice makes a huge difference. Again, a powerful example here is a study of children for which gender differences disappeared when controlled for experience playing Tetris (much more common among boys) . The same can be measurable for Lego.	• Tests are often formulated with examples displaying gender bias. Another intriguing study showed gender differences disappeared when participants were asked not to rotate images, but to shift their own perspective. Other showed better responses when references to vehicles were removed.	• Gender differences don't correlate well with each other. So, for example, some of the largest gender differences in behaviour occur around taking baths (women prefer) and watching boxing. But people who take baths are no more or to watch boxing than those who don't. That is - we don't exist as a cluster of gendered traits. The correlations are too weak, and our individual diversity too strong.But much of this book, like much of Cordelia Fine's work, is dedicated to debunking studies showing biological differences that are gendered. Rippon is a neuroscientist, and the richest material here is looking at brain scans, and how differences by gender can be explained by differences in size. That is, smaller brains have differences in organisation to larger brains. When this effect is controlled for, gender differences recede. Rippon's critics would point out that since women do tend to have smaller brains, this is still a difference.Rippon also seems to be edging towards arguing that there might be a biological basis for girls being more susceptible to social expectations than boys. In the section on the social brain, she talks about the depth of power that social rejection carries - manifesting as akin to physical pain in our brain scans. (Note to self - don't volunteer for brain scan research here!). She tracks tendencies through early childhood, and differences in brain activation in infancy, through to studies that show girls reacting more strongly to the threat of social penalty. She certainly suggests that this might be a compounding factor with stereotype threat of pushing women out of male-dominated fields.Where I think Rippon is weakest is in discussions around hormonal differences. This is particularly frustrating because Cordelia Fine's Testosterone Rex did a fine (heh) job of debunking the connection between testosterone and risk taking, but left alone the far more robustly established link between testosterone and aggression. Rippon acknowledges many of the human studies into testosterone, and at times this gave the book a disjointed feel, as some of her arguments in some sections were not necessarily borne out by others.At the start of the book, Rippon quickly dismisses hormonal research by saying that ""Recent work by Sari van Anders, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, and others shows that in the twenty-first century the link between hormones and behaviour, particularly with respect to the supposed potency of testosterone in determining male aggression and competitiveness, is undergoing a radical rethink."" This caught my attention, as I would not have described an Anders work that way. Rippon then follows up, IMHO more accurately, with ""Just as we are seeing the power of society and its expectations as brain-changing variables, it is clear that the same effect is evident with respect to hormones."" It is a shame she did not discuss Van Anders work more extensively. Van Anders is not at all arguing that testosterone is unconnected to aggression. What she is demonstrating is the way that our social world influences the production of testosterone. Specifically, that way competition participation and behaviours modulate the production of testosterone. This is similar to work that indicates that caring for children can inhibit testosterone production. That is: our social construction can determine our biology.Which brings me back to why I find this topic so exciting: all our current research points us to the power that we have to create the kind of people we want to be. This won't be achieved by ignoring our biology, but neither will it be achieved by viewing our biology as nothing more than explaining our social construction. Only by understanding how we have evolved to create societies, which then create people, which create societies can we understand the power of our socially negotiated beliefs, values and social roles. We can be better than we are - our innate biases, prejudices are not inevitable, although neither are they quickly changed.Also, to state the obvious, parents are not in control of the gender construction of their children. Parenting is a hard gig. And yes, research does suggest that gender stereotyping your kids is not a good thing, no matter how much they seem to be clusters of gendered traits at times. But none of this happens in a vacuum - our society creates our genders (in interaction with biology), not individual parents (unless, of course, you want to lock your kids in a vault and never let them interact with any people or representations of people other than you. Gender then will be the least of their problems).One of the things that the various scientists involved in this debate tend not to emphasise is the role that feminism, sexism and genderqueer liberation movements have on framing this debate. But scientists don't live in a vacuum. We live in a profoundly gender-divided society. How does biology intersect with social construction to create this? Are women simply better geared to be carers, explaining why they perform the vast majority of the world's domestic (unpaid) work? Are men simply better engineers because their testosterone makes it so? Perhaps, as some scientists argue, sexist discrimination is actually made worse by assuming that women's brains are just like men's, leading to a devaluing of empathy and other skills testosterone minimises?Many scientists argue that views on the social nature of women impact negatively on their work. Gina Rippon and others point out that deep sexist assumptions permeate the field, leading science to justify/explain existing inequities, not to challenge them. Others argue that feminist critiques create an atmosphere in which results can't be widely discussed.It is important, and helpful, to acknowledge that social changes impact on how we do science, and what we see in our results. A good example is referred to by Rippon here, in the understand of Intersex conditions. She catalogues the rapid changes in the early millenium regarding both research and medical practice into gender, towards an acknowledgement of more than two categories, and perhaps most importantly, away from a '""deviance"" model that assumes intersex to be a medical condition and towards a ""variance"" model that embraces diversity. This has revolutionised the advice given to parents of Intersex infants.""Neurobiologist Professor Art Arnold has shown that you can separate out the influence of chromosomes from gonads and that these can vary independently, with quite different effects on physical characteristics and on behaviour.9 Hormone levels can fluctuate widely within as well as between groups, and as a function of different contexts and different lifestyles. Genitals, even where clearly identifiable as labia or penises, can present in a startling variety of forms. There is a wonderfully illustrated Scientific American article on the extraordinary complexity of sex determination that makes you wonder that we ever arrived at an end product that looks even remotely classifiable into just two categories. ""  This has not, however, been generated by new research: it has been driven by the activism and courage of Intersex and transgender people. Researchers have known for more than a century that around 1% of the population is Intersex: the difference comes from how we decide to approach that, based on developing understanding of human experience, which has come from the public presence of people with that experience.It is implied that Rippon struggles to integrate the transgender experience. Her language is respectful (an odd use of transsexual aside), and she correctly genders trans individuals. She expresses a hope that transgendered individuals would benefit from a world with less rigid gendered stereotyping, an assumption I think we would all share. This got me thinking, however, about some of the ways feminism is evolving alongside the science. Understanding that gender is socially constructed doesn't minimise the power of that construction - and understanding how early it starts certainly suggests that some fundamentals are unlikely to be reset as we change. I do believe that a different society will produce different people, including differing concepts of gender. That is likely to affect all of us. Maybe a society with less correlation between expected behaviours and genital structures would result in less people wanting bodily modification - maybe it would be more people. What is irrefutable is that the embrace of diversity that is advocated by LGBTI activists of all stripes has a beautiful mirror in the advances in biological sciences that understand the dizzying variety of human skills, cognitive patterns and ways of working. It is young genderqueer activists I see pushing back against a binary, and in the process, empowering science to take us to new places."
5,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62686823-niall,4,"A must-read for anyone living in a gendered world aka 21st century Earth. It's a book every parent, guardian and teacher should read as we are doing more harm than good gendering children at such early ages (by three years old, a child has usually confirmed their gender). I also loved how Gina proves children are the biggest 'gender police,' as it is so important for them to know, especially for navigating school and the playground. For children, performing gender is like self-survival. Also, it's astonishing how scientists go along believing gender has a biological basis and not investigate it fully. Probably for the reason, as Gina suggests, it benefits this predominantly male sector that is the sciences, or STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine), a reality aptly described as 'neurosexism.' Gina also asserts the early 21st first century is more gendered than ever and, while a fascinating opinion, I wished she provided more evidence for this assertion. Finally, be aware of the audiobook. Although well-read, I feel I missed out on a lot of important figures, graphs, photos, scans etc. Also, it can be, at times, very scientific for an audiobook and it would be better to have the scientific terms/acronyms spelt out on paper so I could look them up. Technical issues aside, though, it's a must-read for everyone."
6,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79621357-lona,5,"""Stereotypes could be straitjackening our flexible, plastic brains. So, yes, challenging them does matter."" – Gina Rippon Gina Rippon is a neuroscientist and wants to debunk the myth of the „female brain“ with her book. She wants to make people aware of what neurosexism is and how it developed, why we should check sources of information better and what neurotrash is (books like „Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps“). She points out, how some of the „evidences“ that female/male brains exist where debunked long ago – and how they appear again all the time, like in the game „Whack a Mole“ as „facts“. That the science in this field is like an iceberg: All the outcomes that proof the female brain are the top. The rest will be less publicised or cited by the media, even if it's the bigger part of the iceberg, that's invisible. She does not deny certain differences in general, but she shows us, that stereotypes can be toxic and that nurture and education is a big issue. Some people may ask why it's so important. It's mostly about how to rise your child – that toys matter, for example. Lego is a better training for a brain than a doll. People often tell girls very early, that they will be less good in logical thinking and mathematics, that they should focus on being good-naturred empaths, because their brain is made for being a carer/mother/whatever. They won't be raised for being scientists, their environment makes them believe that they aren't even interested, because being nice, beautiful and social is, what a girls brain wants. And that's one of the reasons why women are underrepresented in certain occupational groups and that society clings to their stereotypes. Depression is one of many things that can result from the problem. I just can say, that my own mother wanted me to be a nice little girl. When I got home from school with a plastered arm one of her „good advices“ was to act more „like a girl“, act like I'd be more interested in beauty than in science or books. For some people violence against girls is justified, if they „don't act like girls“. For some people in general violence against others who don't fit in stereotypes or binaries seems to be totally okay. And that's just another sad result of the whole thing about the gendered brain. And maybe for some children, girl, boy or enby it's not violence, but not being able to fulfill their dreams, not being able to be who they want to be. It doesn't matter – it's an important and interesting topic and I would absolutely recommend that book to everyone who wants to break out of the status quo and ask themselves if we couldn't just move on as science does in oh so modern 2019."
7,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97963492-cp,3,"A fascinating account of current developments in neuroscience. Quite persuasive and a corrective to much neurononsense.However, I couldn’t help feeling that the author was doing precisely what she was accusing others of doing, namely bigging up anything that supported her thesis whilst, at the same time, diminishing or dismissing anything that counted against it. We were often told that a finding that went the other way couldn’t be replicated or had recently been challenged but we were never told whether the findings being quoted in support had ever been questioned.There are times when the author seems to want to have it both ways. On page 108 it says, “If populist coverage links one particular part of the brain to one particular task, they have either misunderstood the research or are not telling the whole story (or both). Beware the God spot.” But then, a few pages later when discussing plasticity, points out that people who are expert in different ways have corresponding areas of their brains that are more developed than the norm. Dig down and the contradiction may not be as severe as it first appears but it is convenient to emphasise the multi-tasking nature of the whole brain when it suits the argument and to emphasise the specialised nature of different areas when that suits.There is the claim that brains become what they are due to the experiences they go through, and boys and girls and men and women undergo different experiences, but this would seem to undermine the mockery made of the early studies that were looking for differences between male and female brains. Surely there should be differences it’s just that those differences don’t necessarily prove what they were assumed to prove.I’m left with questions:Does the gender of the teacher in STEM subjects affect expectations? Do female maths and science teachers still expect boys to do better?How do the claims of this book square with the observation that in secondary education it seems to be the boys that are underperforming?Why is it that in cultures all over the world, and in the past in cultures that had little or no interaction, the same differences in status and roles emerge? (I’m not assuming that this is universally true, there is, presumably, plenty of variation, I’m assuming there is enough significant similarity for there to be some need of an explanation. If there isn’t such similarity that would be important and should have been mentioned.)We are told a number of times that if there are any differences between what we have traditionally labelled male and female brains the effect size is very small but I’m left wondering if there is a biological equivalent of the ‘butterfly effect’ whereby through some kind of feedback loop small differences get magnified up into large social differences.Fun fact: The chemistry professor who discovered testosterone was called Fred Koch (p26)"
8,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2829718-ben,4,"This is a tough one to rate for me because, whilst whole heartedly agreeing with it's message and outlook, I didn't realise that's what it was getting at for the majority of the book. It got off to a bad start when in the introduction it says that because, traditionally, the default pronoun to refer to someone of indeterminate gender (in a study for example) had always been he or s/he at best, then the author was going to redress the balance by using she where possible. When there's perfectly good gender neutral pronouns out there like they/them, this came across as either ignorant, petty, or as biased as previous studies - none of which you want tainting your serious academic information. This isn't helped by 80% of the book seemingly treating gender as a binary and devoting most of its time to proving that there isn't a scientific difference between male and female brains. It came as a genuine shock that in the conclusion the author finally suggests that gender might actually be a spectrum not a binary, and emphasises the danger of a gendered world in reinforcing that. For a message this important to only occur at the end of quite a long book, after being masked under a lot of writing that came across very 'us vs. them,' it does it a real disservice. Partly it's my own fault for not paying enough attention to the subtitle of the book, and for having too high an expectation that a book on gender in 2019 would start where this one leaves off rather than take 400 pages to get there. It's a shame, because all of that aside, the book is really well written and eloquently conveys a lot of information to thoroughly debunk the female brain myth and the centuries of bias that accompany it. Maybe my real problem with it is that it's still necessary to retread all of this stuff in a supposedly modern world, but then again looking around in 2019 there's definitely a resurrgence of outdated, unfounded, dangerous ideas. That said, if it managed to make someone who agreed with it's message entirely think it was heavily biased and potentially untrustworthy before revealing its hand, then I don't see it winning over anyone who strongly disagrees with the sentiment. Ultimately I think it probably comes down to the circles you roll in how much you'll get out of it. If you're still surrounded by people who think men and women are genetically unequal then this book is important and a great resource to gather strength from to demonstrate how maybe they're wrong. If, however, you reached this conclusion a long time ago and are interested in knowing more about the full range of gender and any modern science related to it then is a lot of pages with little reward. "
9,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,2,"We know that male and female bodies differ in some important ways, and that in other mammals there are specific sex dependent behaviors. An obvious extension of those observations is to investigate whether there are sex specific differences in the brains of human males and females that give rise to functional differences that may be behind gender stereotypes. Gina Rippon's book focuses on the ideas of the plasticity and adaptibility of the human brain along with the human brains fine attunement to social information to explain gender differences across cultures, and criticizes how the science of sex differences has been conducted, interpreted, and publicized to perpetuate gender stereotypes.I personally was torn between my feelings about the book because on one the one hand, I found the overall message of the lack of meaningful gender differences to be such an important message to society. Gender differences are still very much part of the social narrative, and it has obvious repercussions in terms of opportunities for women. I found part four, about the gender gap in STEM, to be the most compelling and interesting part of the book. However, I felt like a lot of the rest of the book was not done well. Particularly, I thought a lot of the critical discussion was too one-sided and a little too caustic (like using the term ""neurosexists"" ). I also felt that it was dangerous to ignore sex differences in the physiology of diseases and conditions of the brain! Fairly recently, there was a huge movement to include females in medical research exactly because research was disproportionately benefiting men because of physiological sex differences, so it seems very rash to say things like, ""Perhaps we should just stop looking for sex differences altogether?"" "
10,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2176491-cheryl,2,"Many years ago as an undergraduate student, I majored in Biology and Chemistry with a minor in math. I can totally relate to the bias towards women in STEM because it was a very common attitude when I was a much younger woman. The attitude that women can't do certain things as well as men can has always annoyed me. That said, I do believe there are some biological differences in the way men think and the way women think. It's not a gender determined insurmountable thing, but to totally disregard the small but significant differences in how males and females think is, to me disingenuous. Ignoring small differences is as foolish, in my view, as using small differences as an excuse to discriminate against women. Different does not necessarily mean better or worse. Every study that Gina Rippon cites that alleges small differences between the brains of men and women, is negated as being an insignificant difference and she asserts that there are many studies which argue that there are no differences but they generally are either not published or get no attention. I agree that a good deal of the issue of ""The Gendered Brain"" is the differences in the way we have been raising males and females, but Rippon seems to feel that nurture can explain everything and nature can explain almost nothing in terms of those differences. I simply do not agree with that premise and her book did not convince me otherwise."

Bottom line? Instead of a binary notion of brain differences, the differences exist along continuum’s with considerable gender overlap. Only about 6% of us have stereotypical male or female brains. The rest of us are a mosaic. Early reports from brain imaging of differences in areas such as spatial manipulation of objects or verbal skills seem to disappear when you control for who spends the most time gaming or which babies mothers speak most to.Neuroplasticity is a fact. Our brains respond to our environments and the stereotypes around us. This book is a clarion call to bring to light how the status quo benefits from “pink brain, blue brain” stereotyping and how those of all genders lose finding their paths to full potential. I found nothing, on the other hand, that contradicted Carl Jung’s framework of two preference patterns in criteria for decisions. There is evidence that some of us are more logical, some more empathetic. However, the differences don’t sort to gender. "

The author provides an incredibly complete collection of studies from the 20th century to date, while keeping it fun and interesting. Even though the focus is on the science of the brain and gender relationship, it is highly relevant for anyone working on (or simply interested in) topics that relate to brain processes, like language. Not only touches upon many different misconceptions about the brain but it also offers a comprehensive recollection of measures and techniques that have been or are currently used to study the brain. Most importantly, the book is a wake up call for anyone working on research, specially if related to human behavior, to understand how science and scientific discoveries can be so highly influenced by social moral and beliefs. As much as we want to believe science is a window to understanding the great truths that explain our world,it nevertheless is carried out by scientists. Humans that, at the end of the day are merely individuals with their own biases and beliefs. Definitely recommended, and if you carry with you, it's a great conversation starter."

What do men like? What are girls good at? The answer is, it depends who you ask, how you ask them and who they are. The other answer is, men are women are far more alike than they are different and that’s just fine. This book is dense with discussion of experiments, neuroimaging and statistical analyses and it is fascinating. Much like Cordelia Fine’s work it maintains a sense of humour about its topic (my favourite was the enthusiastic media reporting of a study that showed differences between men and women that failed to note that the original study had been on... hamsters). She also lays out very clearly the way that children act as “gender detectives” who learn what it is expected of their gender at a very young age. Superb work."
16,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5609792-irene,3,"Not much new here. It's a look at various brain studies with suggestions that a slightly different approach might (or might not) have influenced the conclusions reached. Although education and life experiences heavily influence the brain's abilities, studies usually fail to document this kind of information, mentioning only the participants' gender. The author takes several hundred pages to say this, so the book is repetitive and inconclusive. Since very few research studies collect information about education, socioeconomic level, sports activities, occupation, hobbies, early socialization, and other possibly relevant factors, the author could not make a strong case for the theory that male and female brains are different ONLY because of the environments they encounter. This book raises valid questions but provides very few definitive answers. (P.S. I really loved the author's snarky sense of humor.)"
17,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3407688-erwin,4,"**based on the audiobook** The level on which you're going to appreciate this book depends, I think, wholly on the mindset you bring to it. If you're already convinced that gender is a spectrum instead of a dichotomy, this book will spend (too?) much time on fighting your adversaries—aptly called 'neurononsense'. When in doubt, though, or in need of solid counterarguments, or just in search of a wrap-up on the latest hard facts about the (lack of) binary gender proof in brains, this will be your ticket."
18,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88213386-monica,4,This was really interesting! Rippon confirms what I already suspected: that society has become much more polarized when it comes to gender since I myself became a mother in the 1990's. This is very important research and although I am not a natural scientist myself (and I found it difficult to follow some of the more brain-specific passages) I strongly believe this should be compulsory reading for young parents!
19,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2574606-edward-sullivan,4,"A fascinating, engaging look at how findings in neuroscience definitively debunk a long history of damaging pseudo-science and the myth of the biological binary between male and female brains."
20,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356675-stephen,3,"I have to admit being a bit disappointed in this book, though I think most of it wasn't the author's fault, so much as the field she's talking about. I'd previously read Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference. But (to the best of my recollection of that back) in the almost a decade between when that was released and this book's release, the state of research into gender hasn't changed all that much.This book exists to debunk an awful lot of bad science of biological sex and neuroscience. She describes the field as a game of Whac-A-Mole--every time some idea is proved to be bogus, someone brings it back up. Even though what few differences are found between the brains of males and of females, as an aggregate, have found to be minimal (small differences between the averages, with a great deal of overlap), and even though we know more and more about how it is possible or probably that brain plasticity (the ability of brains to change in response to experience) does more to drive gender difference than biology, scientists keep looking for ways that males and females have different brains caused by biology.Part of the problem is that, as the field is currently set up, any finding that some feature of the brain shows no difference between males and females is considered a negative result, and negative results don't typically get published. But shouldn't these be positive results, because we're finding out that, actually, males and females have similar, or effectively the same, brains, at least as far as genetics is concerned?Even more, I'd rather hoped that in the past almost a decade, scientists would have done more to understand how much influence society has in creating gender differences in the brain. But this and related avenues (I was really hoping hear something, anything about trans/non-binary brains) are something that Rippon can only suggest be studied for the future.I might have liked Rippon to explain what her instinct is, her hypotheses. Clearly she thinks plasticity and societal programming are likely to have a role greater than genetics, but that only really comes up to say that the scientific studies she's reviewing don't actually say as much about biology and gender as their author's think they do. But I wanted more, some hint about what's actually going on. I guess I understand why she doesn't, since her whole book is spent taking down those who overreach beyond the evidence. And maybe that's just not the point of this book.That all said, I didn't feel like Rippon is as good a science communicator as she could be (at least not when it comes to writing books) . Though I'm sure this book is considerably easier to read than scientific papers, it's still not that friendly to a lay audience. I think a lot of the details of studies could have been left out, or at least put in the endnotes (instead the endnotes are only plain citations).I also had a few issues on the rare occasions that trans and non-binary people came up--the use of the term 'transsexuals' in this day and age was cringe enducing--though all in all the author seems sympathetic, just not well aware."
21,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9475319-byurakn,5,"Gina Rippon's ""The Gendered Brain"" explores centuries old myths and stereotypes about the female brain and the female behaviour. Examining the papers that have addressed sex differences in brain and skills one by one, she points out the shortcomings of such studies and emphasizes that there are more similarities between men and women than differences. Moreover, most of these differences may be a result of living in a gendered society and a gendered world. She further stresses the importance of leaving these desperate attempts at finding differences and focusing on asking the right questions, such as sex differences regarding physiological differences. And quite controversially, she also challenges the views on gender identity.With sexism being all around, this is an important and empowering book to read. With its scientific approach, the book is providing tools (and literature) to deal with everyday sexism and to have a deeper understanding how the gendered world is shaped around us. "
22,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"This book asks the question, are male and female brains different? It’s written as a reaction to the widely held premise (in both science and popular media) that they are in fact different, and I think that should be kept in mind when reading this book. This book is pretty long and thorough, and spends a lot of time critiquing some of the most often-cited studies in neuroscience that support the idea of sex differences between male and female brains and especially arguments that these have their root in inherent biology instead of culture. However, it also spends a lot of time on various other topics that seem to have nothing in common other than that Rippon thinks they’re interesting. My main criticism of the book is that it is too long and lacks focus. Also, some non-scientist readers might find some sections too dense. Personally, I found the sarcastic tone too caustic. It’s tempting to denigrate your opponents when you feel that you’ve been personally slighted, but as a scientist it makes no sense to present data in a way that will alienate those you wish to convert. However, the science presented in the book is presented logically and includes important details, so I liked that. The format of the relevant parts of the book proceeds as follows: Rippon presents a study that found sex differences in the brain. She discusses why the interpretation is not correct, and slots it into one of two categories. 1. The study misinterpreted the data/conducted the experiment in a non-ideal way so that there is actually no (or negligibly small) sex difference (i.e the famous monkeys playing with male vs. female toys). 2. There is a real sex difference, but there is enough evidence that this could be a result of cultural differences in how we raise boys and girls that it doesn’t provide any evidence that there are inherent biological differences between male and female brains (i.e the consistent but small male advantage in mental rotation tasks is largely explained by video game exposure). The last portion of the book discusses at some length an issue which I assume is close to Rippon’s heart, the gender gap of men and women in STEM fields. As a female scientist, I really enjoyed this portion and found that it resonated with me deeply. The saddest part to me was the evidence showing that females are often just as biased as males when judging their own cognitive abilities, and that this was present even in female scientists. This struck a chord with me personally because I feel the same way. I’m especially proud of myself when I do a spatial or quantitative task well (tasks that “women aren’t supposed to be good at”) compared to tasks of similar difficulty that don’t have gender-associated presumptions. I was brought up in an environment that I view to be relatively gender equal and I was given ample opportunities to pursue whatever career path I chose, and still I have this bias. It’s just so pervasive. The message of the book is nicely summed up in Rippon’s words: “A gendered world creates a gendered brain.” This is an important book, and unfortunately, is long overdue. "
23,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326664-alexis,3,"This is interesting enough but doesn't add anything to previous books on the topic--effectively, that much research on sex/gender differences is poorly done or poorly reported; that differences do not appear to be innate from birth; and that our brains are plastic and that differences develop over time. At least some of those differences are due to socialization or life experience. Given the rise in gender-critical/transphobic feminism in the UK I was a little apprehensive that it might make its way in, since this research has potential implications for trans people. Instead, she mostly avoids the topic until the end. Her summary on the topic is a little weaselly, unnecessarily so--even if we presume that there are few innate biological differences in male and female brains, all that does is suggest that it isn't the source of gender identity, since we all develop one, not that gender identity is not real or has no meaning. "
24,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63369210-elisa-fuhrmann,3,"Yesterday, I finished THE GENDERED BRAIN by Gina Rippon, the 3rd book for @femi.books Feminist Book Club and it was a very interesting read! I have to admit, I'm glad that I took a course on cognitive neuroscience during my Bachelor's, because otherwise some information would not have been understandable for me. Nevertheless, Rippon makes a great attempt at writing about cognitive neuroscience for the general public. I don't think she succeeded completely, but it was still good. In The Gendered Brain, Rippon looks into how neuroscientists have studied the brain over the years and how the gendered lens through which society views gender has actually shaped scientific studies and society's pre-conceived notions of the brain. Lots of previous studies are flawed, sometimes stemming from a prejudice that women are inferior to men. We should remember that the brain's plasticity plays a big role, meaning that we are able to learn, adapt, and change continuously as we grow. While one skill or ability might strenghten, others might weaken. In addition, how we educate and raise children affects their view of their own and others genders' and how they should adapt their behaviour accordingly, or rather, according to society. One of my favourite quotes from this book is: 'Brains reflect the lives they have lived, not just the sex of their owners'. Rippon reviewed hundreds of studies, which for me was a good and a bad thing. Obviously, she was very thorough, which really helps support her arguments. However, sometimes it felt like I was reading a textbook rather than a non-fictional book for the general public. Additionally, the book felt very repetitive to me sometimes and it was very hard to get into. I feel like Rippon could have left out some bits. This would have made a point a bit clearer I think, because now I was drowning sometimes in a big ocean of information on cognitive neuroscientific studies. I took a 4-day break because I felt a reading slump coming up. Unfortunately I'm not good at reading multiple books at the same time so I just waited for a few days before I picked it up again. In the end, I really liked it and I do think that this is a very interesting, eye-opening and educative read for many! I am rating this book with ⭐⭐⭐"
25,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15084678-slowjammer,3,"It took me 11h and 20mn to read it all.Decent book on a difficult topic to objectively address. My thoughts below:- For women readers, I think a 4-star rating is probably justified. I gave a 3-star to reflect how painful many passages are for men readers. The author's bias (understandable as she is a woman) is hard to miss and makes for some very frustrating parts. The conclusion of which is that she alienates half her potential audience. Many men will probably tune out and it's difficult to believe that there is a serious effort here to convince, nudge or debate objectively with men to change their views and attitudes. The middle of the book is almost exclusively focused on prejudices against women in sciences. An interesting sad topic to be sure, but somehow that should be reflected in the title... there is zero attempt to develop any similar negative stereotypes affecting the male human experience. Or it is implicitly believed that men are living in a utopia of happiness thanks to the crushing stereotypes they direct at women.- Where the book shines is on highlighting and deconstructing the many false science out there and essentially convincing us that there is not much credible research demonstrating any material difference between the biology of brains of men and women. Passages explaining why some research lingering out is erroneous or sensationalized is very instructive. I only wish she would apply the same tough critical eye to the findings she promotes as backed by real science. As it is it reads as slightly unbalanced or hypocritical (or vindictive against some of the field's scientists)."
26,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112300-anca,2,"I wanted to read this book to have more clarify about the subject - are men and women different or not and does it even matter? I am one to believe that men and women are different and denying it seems like ignorance. From a biological point of view, there are physical and hormonal differences and we share this feature with all the other species on Earth. Then from an evolutionary point of view, being the ""weaker"" sex for millions of years, our minds and bodies being controlled by society (and men in particular) must leave a mark of how brains react differently to different stimuli. The books goes through a lot of complex and not very clear studies about the brain, where it's hard to determine exactly if the difference seen in behavior is based on real physical difference in the brain or conditioning from society. As soon as we are in the womb, we seem to be ""hungry"" beings looking for social clues about how everybody expects us to perform. So the book didn't really clarify a lot for me on this matter. Anyway, I believe we need to stop having this men vs women attitude. At this time in our evolution, the next step must leave full room for the same opportunities for men and women and we must stop putting women into boxes - either too bossy (not female enough) or too empathic (not capable of success like a man would). We have started to raise girls/women to be more independent and ambitious, but we need to learn boys/men to be more empathic as well."
27,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6140798-mizuki,5,"It is an encouraging and also discouraging book as a female and as a girl's mother (though I know this explanation is already 'gendered'). I think those who want to raise their kids free from gender stereotypes would enjoy this book, but I want to recommend this book to those who have strong stereotypical view. Good fact from this book - our brain is malleable ! "

31,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47140848-liv,4,"The Gendered Brain was this month's @femi.books book club pick. I have to say I wouldn't have ordinarily picked up this book if it hadn't been for the book club as although it sounds interesting it's not my usual read. Not everyone picked up the book this month for various reasons given the current climate. I would say the book it a little dense and required some googling, but overall it was really informative and interesting. This is why I'd say it might not be the easiest of reads at the moment but I would recommend if you're interested in feminism and science pick it up.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Rippon excelled at unpicking how scientific studies are put together. She highlights how they can get distorted by the media, how they can be misleading based on the number of individuals in the study, whether humans or animals are used and the types of questions asked. Rippon does her best to make it accessible to the common reader. I discussed with my boyfriend who has a background in science and he explained the difficulty in making science studies accessible and this made me realise how well Rippon does.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Rippon made some fascinating points about gender. The ones I found particularly poignant were her arguments about PMS and how it has been connected (particularly in the West) with negative emotions and most surveys focus on the negative emotions. She unpicks the arguments around whether a male and female brain exists. One main argument is that men are better at spatial tasks, however, she points out that brain plasticity can change. If people play video games, build with Lego and various other tasks they can increase their spatial awareness and abilities. She argues it isn't based on gender. There were lots of points that she unpicks really well.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀There were a few chapters towards the end that felt a little repetitive and I would not say this book was a quick read. However, I tabbed it up and had several lengthy discussions with my boyfriend and do think this offers a lot of insight into society, the brain and gender. She also concludes that whilst sex can be important, it doesn't need to be the whole focus."
32,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32879365-julia,3,"First, style and tone. Very science, much dense, wow research. This one doesn’t seem like it’s for the average civilian. Also, I did an audiobook, and the British narrator made it even more dense (and yes, the author is British and uses some language and examples that are obviously British, especially with this narrator). Second, groundbreaking? This seemed like a hard science proof of what women’s studies classes taught me a decade ago: there are more differences within each category of gender than between the two binary categories, almost all differences reported by “science” are bogus, the tiny differences that can be found can be attributed to neuroplasticity and the way hegemonic structures treat women and men differently, not inherent brain differences from birth, etc. All of this was brought up and backed up here with so much data and studies and science. But, for some, this level of data and studies and brain science may be the only thing that will convince people. Certainly women’s studies majors haven’t had universal success changing the patriarchy in our society. So in that sense, this book is important, and hopefully will add to the change we desperately need, for every person of every gender, for equality and justice, for mental health, for representation, and more."
33,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410211-rose,2,"Thoroughly researched, this book exposes the misuse of (neuro)science to uphold gender stereotypes and systems of oppression. Gina Rippon patiently deconstructs the most popular myths on neuroscience and sex/gender differences, and explains that they are based on flimsy research methods and poor statistical analyses. Apart from advocating for better design of experiments, she writes that ethics must take a central role in order to dismantle gender bias within neuroscience, and that science communications should be less click-baity and/or focused on highlighting differences. She also mentions (though not really delves into it, which was disappointing) the importance of involving the social sciences in neuroscience research, given that socio-cultural factors apart from cultural gender roles, like race and class, also play a role in the development of our brains. Despite all of the book's merits, my biggest gripe with it book is that, despite the convincing arguments the author makes in favor of the plasticity of the brain and against biological essentialism, her focus on sex and gender is still binary, erasing the existence and experiences of intersex, non-binary and trans folks."
34,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66496256-christina-reid,5,"A fascinating and hugely important read about the messages we are sent about gender from the moment we arrive into the world and how so much research has been focused on the difference between 'male' and 'female' brains when actually our brains are much more similar than different and society and lifestyle lead to bigger variations than biological sex.I read this slowly, a chapter at a time so I was able to digest the messages it was sending - as someone with no background in neuroscience, a lot of the information was completely new to me and I ended up doing extra reading around each chapter in order to clarify the messages and making sure I was actually getting what the author was saying. Despite my lack of background knowledge, this book is clearly written and understandable, even for a layperson or complete novice in the field like me.With a daughter on the way, this book has made me think really carefully about the messages she will be receiving, especially as so much of the research seems to point towards girls self-limiting their ambitions because of the societal messages they are given.Hugely important and enlightening read!"

She’s really f-ing funny, relevant and was able to convey this entire book in about an hour with a huge sense of humour and passion. She’s an incredible person. I was really lucky to hear her speak.I already read Inferior and the two come to the same conclusion - men and women have more in common then not, so why spend all this time focusing on it?I’ll add my notes later - but read this book! It’s easy to read, funny and so important now more than ever."
36,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80866994-claire,4,"A readable, questioning dialogue of the systemic gender inequality that extends so deeply that the very 'evidence' we count on to negate it is drenched in the same bias. Gina is clever and funny which makes this at times disheartening read still feel so satisfying. Should probably be one of those books that we have to read every few years just to maintain our honesty. "
37,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91839807-adora,4,"Honestly after reading this book I want to not tell anyone my hypothetical future offspring's biological sex, at least prior to school age. We still treat boys and girls very differently, and that fact - more than any essential biological difference in our brains (for which there is scant quality evidence) - affects outcomes in confidence, school performance, and career choices.Rippon lays out compelling evidence against decades of misguided work by evolutionary biologists and psychologists who seem more interested in using science as a cudgel to maintain the status quo than in accepting the powerful role played by gender socialization. An important takeaway is that children as young as 2 or 3 are keen ""gender detectives,"" attuned to the behavior of people around them and the normative nature of the roles we cage them in."
38,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49919504-groucho42,4,"I thought it was going to be about gender identify and the brain, but it was almost exclusively about debunking so much of the nonsense that exists about the differences between men and women's brains. A key to understanding this book is to understand effect size, a statistical formula for looking at the significance of the difference between two sets. In reality most of the differences in brains have very small effect sizes, but both researchers and media act as if there are major differences.While the book is good at debunking bad research, it's too long for its content and begins to get a tad boring. A more concise text with more information about the real differences, rather than a giant (yet, admittedly, needed) focus on the over-hyped, sexist, nonsense out there would have been more interesting.A good, not great read with a nice touch of both humor and cynicism throughout."
39,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723937-j,3,"I already agreed with Rippon's fundamental point, so I'm probably not in a place to critique the book from that angle. I simply list a pro and a con. Con: Rippon seems to dismiss research she sees as problematic without giving enough justification for her flippancy. Or, rather, she dismisses lots of research studies for similar reasons. Oftentimes, her critiques seem valid, but since there isn't necessarily another study to point to, this can come off as simply dismissing the results she disagrees with. Pro: this book is full of humorous anecdotes and is told with a wink-and-a-nod style that I found quite charming."

Informative.In this book, Rippon goes through the history of neurology and mainstream beliefs and assumptions on the difference between male and female brains from early on to the present.Rippon is a researcher in cognitive neuroscience in the UK and an advocate for women in STEM.The book is broken down into chapters of about 20 pages in length and include history, a wide range of research comparisons and interpretations and the effect of media and society on our beliefs. Her tone is very academic, giving credit to her work but possibly being too heavy for some readers.In my opinion the title is a bit faulty. Rippon doesn't focus solely on female brains but goes into equal length into male brains. I really liked this book, especially compared to similar books I've read in the past. I only wish Rippon could have provided suggestions on things we could do individually to break the assumptions in society."
44,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9078855-rachel,3,"Book review: The Gendered Brain is a new 2019 book by Professor Gina Rippon for general readers. It looks into how neuroscientists have studied the brain over the years + how the gendered lens through which society views gender has actually shaped scientific studies and society’s pre-conceived notions of the brain. The key take away message: There are more similarities than differences between the supposed male/female divide, and the brain as we know it, isn’t gendered from birth. From this book, we learn that there were lots of flawed scientific studies/papers that led to flawed thinking. In the past, people believed women were inferior to men because of their brains, and that having a bigger brain meant you were smarter. Our brains are also multitaskers, each layer not being a single “god” controlling certain functions but each capable of multi-tasking. The plasticity of our brains also means we are able to learn, adapt and change continuously as we grow, but while one kind of skill/ability might strengthen, another might also weaken, making it important to constantly challenge and exercise our minds.The ways in which we educate boys and girls is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It affects how good people can become at certain things (e.g. by telling women that women are better at doing certain things leads to them scoring better, and vice versa). As such, raising children in a genderless way perhaps would be best, in order for humans to achieve their greatest potential and not have their abilities and skills overshadowed or undermined by what society classes as feminine/masculine skillsets.To end my review with a fun fact: babies born with sight have colour vision, and regardless of gender, they are drawn to reddish and greenish yellow stimuli (hence not only baby girls are drawn to the colour pink!) I recommend getting this book if you’re into all things brain or gender-related :) Thanks @definitelybooks for this review copy! 🧠♥️ "
45,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7092147-nancy,5,"Are Male and Female Brains Different?For centuries there has been a bias toward describing the sex differences between men and women seen in social behavior as due to differences in the brain. Early research on the brain, as the author points out in the first section of the book, appeared to uphold this hypothesis. However, careful analysis of the research findings suggests that many of the studies were flawed, or biased toward generating the results they produced. I found these first chapters fascinating. It’s a cautionary tale that in order to understand the results we must look at methods, and samples. Too often the news trumpets the results with no understanding of how they were achieved. The second half of the book looks at more modern research utilizing functional MRI and brain imaging techniques. The chapters on research on newborns are fascinating. What they’re finding is that many of the myths about babies and small children are not accurate. Boys are supposed to be more interested in mechanical gadgets and girls in dolls. The more researcher bias is removed from the experimental setup, the more this difference washes out. I agree with the conclusion of the author that it would be a good idea to pay more attention to individual differences. When large data sets are used many interesting findings are washed out as outliers. I think this is a very promising area of research. I highly recommend this book if you’re interested in sex differences. The question of nature vs nurture is well explored and suggests that environment plays a significant role in how boys and girls see each other and themselves. This has implications for education and the socialization of young and not so young children. I received this book from Pantheon for this review."

47,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions,4,"Rippon delves in detail into the brain science studies that have been done in an attempt to determine the neurological foundation to gender differences and slowly but surely rips it apart. She explains in clear terms the way that the goals of the studies, the assumptions of the studies, the biases of the studies, and sociological factors all make the results unreliable. She also talks about how the reporting on scientific studies can be confusing because a ""significant difference"" from a scientific perspective might be minuscule from a non-scientific perspective.I will totally be hurling this book at the head of anyone who tells me that men and women are different because of their brains. Our brains are substantially different only in ways determined by the way that men and women are raised differently.As this is a scientific title, it does get a bit repetitive, particularly in the conclusion, which recaps everything covered in the book, but it was well worth it for all the knowledge gained. If you've an interest in gender roles and differences, I'd highly recommend reading this."
48,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49439550-florence,4,"It shatters the myth that male brains and female brains are any different and it goes through different academic papers proving or disagreeing with this theory. It suggests that we as babies absorb everything around us from birth, including gender stereotypes and it looks at the implications of this on our lives both for males and females. I've found it has made me look at the world in a different way, causing me to struggle to feel angry at someone because everyone is so much a product of their environment. At the same time, I find it very empowering because it allows you to be reflective of your own life and where gender bias may have impacted and influenced you and others around you, and how you can move away from it.The beginning has a lot of back story of arguments/thesis' through history which have been inherently wrong, this can go on for a while and sometimes be confusing when they compared different theories and examples in the beginning. It wasn’t always apparent that they were disagreeing with said arguments, although I think this confusion can be avoided by reading rather than listening to the book (I listened on Audible)."

It's a topic I'm already passionate about from a social, anthropological sense, but had never really learned the science (or lack there of) behind it. This book was a great read. My only complaint is that Rippon seemed a bit dismissive of the experience of the Trans community. They were only mentioned briefly twice in the book and she didn't go into detail on any of the recent scientific studies which have been conducted regarding the science behind being Transgender and how it affects the brain. I understand this wasn't her focus, but I think it would have been an interesting and informative addition. Especially studies regarding trans people who undergo hormone therapy treatments. How the change in hormones affects their brain could sow some interesting light. But perhaps these studies either haven't been done or were done too recently to include in Rippon's work. "

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
67,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
68,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

Rush hour is starting, and traffic is fast and heavy. They've got no satnav. He's driving and she's got a road atlas balanced on her lap.""Which way?"" he asks as an exit is signposted. She stares at the map but it's just a confusion of writhing coloured lines that looks nothing like the road system they're in. She thinks they should take the exit but she's not 100% sure. ""WHICH WAY?""""I don't know!""""YOU'VE GOT THE MAP FFS""""DON'T YELL AT ME!""What if she's heard her whole life that women can't read maps? One simple mistake is going to prove that.

One simple mistake doesn't mean a thing. Gina Rippon does a brilliant job of debunking many commonly held stereotypes about about male and female aptitudes, and more importantly demonstrates the harm they do, eroding girls self esteem and their ability to reach their full potential. There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor. It's worth reading, regardless in order to fully appreciate ""the gendered waters in which we swim."""
70,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea,3,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, and a lot of information that I think is very important. That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
71,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."
72,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954421-vanessa,5,"A measured and thorough takedown of the science of “male” vs “female” brains, from the dawn of science to modern neuroscience studies. (Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
73,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
74,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."

It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."

I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented.

Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
79,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."

To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"

The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in.

As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic.

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
97,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
98,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor.

That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start.

101,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."

(Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."

Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
104,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
105,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."
106,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9477823-mekon,4,"As someone who fits under the LGBT+ umbrella, I approached this book with some misgivings and open to have my own outlook challenged. Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
107,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
108,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
109,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
110,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"
111,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375203-jackie,4,"Another challenging read, #3 in my Quarantine Summer of Neuroscience. This was a well-reasoned and often entertaining book. The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

113,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9015434-laura,4,"This book could be summarised as ""we are what we do"". Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

In The Gendered Brain, neuroscientist Gina Rippon delves deep into the topic of whether or not we actually have 'female brains' and 'male brains' in a scientific sense, and how much of the perceived brain differences actually depend on societal attitudes and performativity of gender.This book definitely gripped me and gave me lots to think about, but overall I found the structure to be too long and meandering, often repetitive to the point where it was no longer repetitive in an educational sense, but in a more frustrating sense. However, the merit and importance of this book should not be understated, and I do recommend it for everyone even though I feel it could have done with being cut down a bit."

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in.

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

Other times it feels like a confusion of stats, random, and more of just a look at how poorly done most research has been. It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic. Overall it was a good look at how complex the idea of gender is and how ingrained it is in culture that it has made it very difficult to study scientifically without bias."

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
127,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
128,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor. It's worth reading, regardless in order to fully appreciate ""the gendered waters in which we swim."""
130,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea,3,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, and a lot of information that I think is very important. That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
131,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."
132,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954421-vanessa,5,"A measured and thorough takedown of the science of “male” vs “female” brains, from the dawn of science to modern neuroscience studies. (Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
133,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
134,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
135,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
137,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
138,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
139,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
140,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"
141,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375203-jackie,4,"Another challenging read, #3 in my Quarantine Summer of Neuroscience. This was a well-reasoned and often entertaining book. The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly).

Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic.

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."

Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
158,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

Rush hour is starting, and traffic is fast and heavy. They've got no satnav. He's driving and she's got a road atlas balanced on her lap.""Which way?"" he asks as an exit is signposted. She stares at the map but it's just a confusion of writhing coloured lines that looks nothing like the road system they're in. She thinks they should take the exit but she's not 100% sure. ""WHICH WAY?""""I don't know!""""YOU'VE GOT THE MAP FFS""""DON'T YELL AT ME!""What if she's heard her whole life that women can't read maps? One simple mistake is going to prove that. On he other hand, what if she's driving?""Which way?""""Er...""""WHICH WAY?""""DON'T YELL AT ME!"" etcOf course if he sends them the wrong way it's just a mistake, a one off that could happen to anyone. One simple mistake doesn't mean a thing. Gina Rippon does a brilliant job of debunking many commonly held stereotypes about about male and female aptitudes, and more importantly demonstrates the harm they do, eroding girls self esteem and their ability to reach their full potential. There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor. It's worth reading, regardless in order to fully appreciate ""the gendered waters in which we swim."""
160,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea,3,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, and a lot of information that I think is very important. That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
161,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."
162,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954421-vanessa,5,"A measured and thorough takedown of the science of “male” vs “female” brains, from the dawn of science to modern neuroscience studies. (Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
163,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
164,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
165,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
167,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
168,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
169,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
170,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"
171,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375203-jackie,4,"Another challenging read, #3 in my Quarantine Summer of Neuroscience. This was a well-reasoned and often entertaining book. The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

Other times it feels like a confusion of stats, random, and more of just a look at how poorly done most research has been. It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic. Overall it was a good look at how complex the idea of gender is and how ingrained it is in culture that it has made it very difficult to study scientifically without bias."

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
187,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
188,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

Rush hour is starting, and traffic is fast and heavy. They've got no satnav. He's driving and she's got a road atlas balanced on her lap.""Which way?"" he asks as an exit is signposted. She stares at the map but it's just a confusion of writhing coloured lines that looks nothing like the road system they're in. She thinks they should take the exit but she's not 100% sure. ""WHICH WAY?""""I don't know!""""YOU'VE GOT THE MAP FFS""""DON'T YELL AT ME!""What if she's heard her whole life that women can't read maps? One simple mistake is going to prove that.

One simple mistake doesn't mean a thing. Gina Rippon does a brilliant job of debunking many commonly held stereotypes about about male and female aptitudes, and more importantly demonstrates the harm they do, eroding girls self esteem and their ability to reach their full potential. There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor. It's worth reading, regardless in order to fully appreciate ""the gendered waters in which we swim."""
190,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea,3,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, and a lot of information that I think is very important. That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
191,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."
192,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954421-vanessa,5,"A measured and thorough takedown of the science of “male” vs “female” brains, from the dawn of science to modern neuroscience studies. (Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
193,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
194,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
195,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
197,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
198,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
199,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
200,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"

The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

203,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9015434-laura,4,"This book could be summarised as ""we are what we do"". Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash. Boo to evolutionary psychology and the retrograde conceptions of humanity and our brains in which it's embedded."

In The Gendered Brain, neuroscientist Gina Rippon delves deep into the topic of whether or not we actually have 'female brains' and 'male brains' in a scientific sense, and how much of the perceived brain differences actually depend on societal attitudes and performativity of gender.This book definitely gripped me and gave me lots to think about, but overall I found the structure to be too long and meandering, often repetitive to the point where it was no longer repetitive in an educational sense, but in a more frustrating sense. However, the merit and importance of this book should not be understated, and I do recommend it for everyone even though I feel it could have done with being cut down a bit."

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in. ""The Gendered Brain"" is an extremely interesting and accessible account of today's scientific knowledge about the subject and has provided me with some food for though especially concerning the education of some possible future sons and daughters."

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move. In the meantime, nonsense continues to have resonance boxes in the form of magazine headlines and today, with social media, posts that carry on a social stigma towards women."

It made me realize how little brains are understood and that the traditional concept that one part of the brain is solely responsible for one thing, is rarely true. Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

Other times it feels like a confusion of stats, random, and more of just a look at how poorly done most research has been. It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic. Overall it was a good look at how complex the idea of gender is and how ingrained it is in culture that it has made it very difficult to study scientifically without bias."

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
217,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
218,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

She stares at the map but it's just a confusion of writhing coloured lines that looks nothing like the road system they're in. She thinks they should take the exit but she's not 100% sure. ""WHICH WAY?""""I don't know!""""YOU'VE GOT THE MAP FFS""""DON'T YELL AT ME!""What if she's heard her whole life that women can't read maps? One simple mistake is going to prove that.

One simple mistake doesn't mean a thing. Gina Rippon does a brilliant job of debunking many commonly held stereotypes about about male and female aptitudes, and more importantly demonstrates the harm they do, eroding girls self esteem and their ability to reach their full potential. There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor. It's worth reading, regardless in order to fully appreciate ""the gendered waters in which we swim."""
220,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea,3,"There were a lot of interesting facts in this book, and a lot of information that I think is very important. That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
221,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."

(Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
223,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
224,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
225,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
227,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented.

228,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
229,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."

To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"

The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

In The Gendered Brain, neuroscientist Gina Rippon delves deep into the topic of whether or not we actually have 'female brains' and 'male brains' in a scientific sense, and how much of the perceived brain differences actually depend on societal attitudes and performativity of gender.This book definitely gripped me and gave me lots to think about, but overall I found the structure to be too long and meandering, often repetitive to the point where it was no longer repetitive in an educational sense, but in a more frustrating sense. However, the merit and importance of this book should not be understated, and I do recommend it for everyone even though I feel it could have done with being cut down a bit."

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in.

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

Other times it feels like a confusion of stats, random, and more of just a look at how poorly done most research has been. It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic. Overall it was a good look at how complex the idea of gender is and how ingrained it is in culture that it has made it very difficult to study scientifically without bias."

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
247,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
248,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

One simple mistake doesn't mean a thing. Gina Rippon does a brilliant job of debunking many commonly held stereotypes about about male and female aptitudes, and more importantly demonstrates the harm they do, eroding girls self esteem and their ability to reach their full potential. There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths. That's not because I'm a woman but because the standard of maths tuition in state schools under the Tory government of the 80s was very poor.

That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start. "
251,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."

(Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."

Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "

Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
255,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."

Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
257,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
258,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
259,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
260,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"
261,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375203-jackie,4,"Another challenging read, #3 in my Quarantine Summer of Neuroscience. This was a well-reasoned and often entertaining book. The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay.

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

263,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9015434-laura,4,"This book could be summarised as ""we are what we do"". Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash.

In The Gendered Brain, neuroscientist Gina Rippon delves deep into the topic of whether or not we actually have 'female brains' and 'male brains' in a scientific sense, and how much of the perceived brain differences actually depend on societal attitudes and performativity of gender.This book definitely gripped me and gave me lots to think about, but overall I found the structure to be too long and meandering, often repetitive to the point where it was no longer repetitive in an educational sense, but in a more frustrating sense. However, the merit and importance of this book should not be understated, and I do recommend it for everyone even though I feel it could have done with being cut down a bit."

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in.

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move.

Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic.

Maybe this is the reason why men have been inventing reasons trying to prove that women are inferior for centuries.In Gender and Our Brains, Gina Rippon takes on centuries of “science”, or what she refers to as “Whack-A-Mole Myths”, that have tried to prove women’s minds are inferior to men’s. Starting with measuring how much bird seed each skull could hold (after the person died) they figured out that men’s brains, on average, are larger than women’s brains ergo men are smarter. Based on this reasoning, elephants must put us all to shame!In Three Hundred Fifty-Eight pages (plus Sixty-Two pages of notes) Rippon lays into all of the “psychobabble, neurotrash, and neurosexism” showing that men have used each new scientific invention to try to defend this hypothesis. From cranial measurements to phrenology to blood work to fMRIs male scientists have been trying to prove there are male and female brains - with the former being superior to the latter.What is most upsetting to me about this book is that science and scientists are supposed to be objective. The goal of science is to uncovering truths, not to push a sexist, political agenda. Of course, we have seen “scientists” and foundations pushing similar misinformation about race with the eugenics movement so this book does not come as a complete surprise.Rippon’s book pushes back at the tidal wave of sexism with great amounts of research data. This book is not an easy read because it is, at heart, an intense, scientific paper. This is exactly what makes the book so important - that Rippon has not written an opinion piece but a scientific thesis to backup her attacks on sexist scientists and scientific organizations.Not only have these “scientific” studies used dubious methodology but the authors, looking for headlines and grant money, often misrepresent the finding which results in major news headlines pushing the male-female brain divide. Most recently this grabbed the news cycle when Google employee James Damore, in July 2017, wrote a memo pushing back on the Google’s drive to hire more female programers. Relying on faulty research and his own sexist thinking, he argued that Google should focus on hiring men because women could not keep up.I like science and I feel that the process of asking questions and uncovering the secrets of the universe will lead to the betterment of the human race. Unfortunately, for many, life is about power, control, and money. People with vested interests, which in the US usually means white men, twist facts in order to maintain their control and influence. Right now, July, 2020, we are seeing this everyday in terms of; race relations, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic policies, and global warming. Fortunately Gina Rippon has written a book to push back by pulling off the covers to show the sexist agenda hiding underneath “scientific” brain studies. Do yourself a favor and read it."
277,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92386898-jeff,4,"Gina Rippon’s erudite book The Gendered Brain shatters any misconceptions about the Human brain being gendered as male or female. Using cutting-edge neuroscience Rippon debunks the gender based myths and stereotypes that have plagued our understanding of the human brain since the 18th century in a timely and informed manner that provides the evidence to tackle cultural and physiological sexism.The Gendered Brain begins with a history lesson evaluating the how and why the notion of a ‘gendered brain’ occurred and persisted as ‘fact’ through to our modern age. The very outdated concepts of Phrenology have a lot to answer for, as does the excuse of female hormones and Rippon does an outstanding job of contextualising how scientists working without modern imaging techniques basically made up physiologically sex differences based on skin-deep observations. Next in the firing line for a good debunking is the reams of pyschobabble, neurotrash, neurosexism of the twentieth century where new technologies and imaging techniques began to provide ‘answers’ to how men and women were supposed to think. However, Rippon shows that during this period neuroscience fell into the trap of trying to prove the notion of the gendered brain. It seems these new technologies, coupled to culturally static investigations were providing answers to the wrong questions. And it certainly doesn’t help with a culturally static media jumping on any chance to cement the status quo of gender differences. Rippon then moves onto contemporary neuroscience and the modal of a ‘social brain’ exploring how the brain functions as a tool of social interaction and how this is tied up with our self-identity, our self-esteem and the implications for the study of gender differences. Rippon explores our very early brains from pre-birth to early childhood and how receptive and plastic our brains are to the environments within which brains develop. It is Rippon’s conclusions that our brain soaks in gendered information from the world around it. Within the first few months of life a baby is confronted with gendered images of what females and males look like, dress like, sound like and how they interact with them. It is in the end quite a common sense conclusion, gender in=gender out. Rippon does an outstanding job in showing how our brains plasticity soaks in the gendered world it develops in, showing that we grow and develop within a gendered world. This has massive implications for female self-identity and self-esteem and shows that it is not inbuilt sex differences that hinder women in ‘traditionally male’ exploits, but is instead a constant bombardment on what socially is and isn’t considered feminine eagerly soaked up by a very receptive brain. It is teeth gnashingly frustrating to read how women are short-changed from birth by pre-existing concepts of gender roles that have no physiological basis. It is Rippon’s great feat with The Gendered Brian in showing why these gender myths should be put to bed permanently. "
278,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97654455-angelica,4,"When I came across this book, I assumed (and hoped) that it would provide an insightful explanation for the psychological phenomenon of gender and its relation to our brains. That’s not what I got, but this book was intensely interesting nonetheless.Gender and Our Brains is a meta-analysis of brain research by neuroscientists, psychologists, and others. It provides a very in-depth look into the history of brain science, particularly in relation to sex differences in the brain. From analyzing various bumps on the skull to advanced fMRI techniques, brain science has come a long way. However, one important stance that this book takes is that the field of brain science is deeply flawed and has much improving to do. Although science aims to remain objective, scientists are still people, and are therefore still susceptible to societal norms and biases about sex and gender, which can shape their research in misleading ways.One of the most interesting and disheartening aspects of this book was its exploration into how societal pressures and stereotypes create gender gaps in STEM. As a woman in science myself, I do sometimes feel isolated from my male peers, although the situation is improving. It is clear that Gina Rippon, being a female neuroscientist herself, comes from a place of care and concern for the field in her analysis of how low self-esteem caused by gender stereotyping can dissuade young girls from pursuing careers in STEM-related fields.My main problem with this book comes from its lack of discussion of how sex and gender are related. Although intersex is discussed briefly in several sections, it is not until the final chapter that transgender individuals are brought up. The discrepancy between outward sex and internal gender presentation is deeply fascinating, and could provide meaningful insights into how gender is affected by sex, and vice versa. Rippon does take the stance that sex and gender are a spectrum, but this idea could have been explored so much further. For this reason, I think the title of this book is misleading. Perhaps it should be changed to Sex and Our Brains, although I can see how that could easily be mistaken for a different book entirely.Overall, Gender and Our Brains is a deeply fascinating and relevant book that everyone (especially parents of young children) could benefit from. It provides meaningful insight into the implications of sexism and gender stereotyping, and shows that a societal re-think of gender expectations is desperately in order."

There's no such thing as a map reading brain, or a maths brain, or a female brain because, and this is really obvious when you think about it, brains learn. Our performance at any given task is going to reflect our training and experience, and is conditioned by our expectations, rather than innate ability.The Gendered Brain is also quite entertaining on the subject of dodgy reporting of research in the field. I couldn't help wondering why so many scientists are so keen to look for sex differences in the brain. It seems like there are a lot of vested interests out there working to preserve the status quo of women underrepresented in STEM disciplines on he grounds that they are congenitally unsuitable.I regret that I didn't fully understand some of the statistical information in the book because I'm not very good at maths.

That said, I had a hard time staying engaged. The main thesis throughout is that science has not yet identified any consistent, ""hardwired"" difference between male and female brains, and seems unlikely to do so anytime soon. The author painstakingly goes through where such ideas have cropped up in the past and takes to task the flawed research and science journalism that have enabled the continuation of various common misperceptions. This is done with a lot of discussion of studies, statistical analysis, and more studies. She maintains a wry sense of humor throughout, but it's hard for me to see much of this as anything but dry, especially since this was already pretty much the sense I had of the general state of things. I'm not nearly scientifically literate enough to be able to argue the points as thoroughly as she does, but I also don't need to be convinced, so without any mind-blowing challenges to my preconceived notions to keep my attention, it felt very much like sitting through a very detailed explanation of why the people I was pretty sure were wrong, were in fact wrong.She does a very good job of emphasizing throughout how complex the interactions between environmental and biological factors are, and how inadequate the binary framing of ""nature vs. nurture"" is, but she also doesn't even approach the idea of sex or gender as a spectrum rather than a binary until the final chapter, which felt like a missed opportunity. Not only do I think that angle could have greatly informed and deepened the analysis in prior chapters, but to be honest, that was the aspect I found most interesting, and I was disappointed it didn't elicit a more thorough discussion.Overall, for me, this book was a bit of a slog, but if you or someone you know still needs convinced that women and men are indeed of the same species, and mentally more alike than different, this would be a very good place to start.

281,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26858538-julia,4,"This is the first book that really impressed upon me the importance of looking under the bonnet of quoted scientific studies to understand how they were setup and how researchers’ biases and wish to get the ‘right’ answer might compromise the validity of outcomes – in the past I often trusted well respected media outlets and papers to do that for me. Shockingly, however, the book highlights how even respected scientific journalists do not necessarily look close enough and the damage that it can leave in its wake can be long-lasting. Which is why learning about so-called Neurotrash and the value of neuro-scepticism has been so fascinating and encouraged me to be more cautious – for the first time in my life I’m now investigating the references in the book (including this one!).Understanding neuroscience and how it is presented to the public, especially in relation to gender, was the first part of the book and whilst I found it well-informing and educational, it was a bit of a slow burn with a couple of poorly laid out theories (e.g. allusion to PMS being a thing only in the western world)– they were just dropped there without further follow-up or nuanced explanation. The book really comes into its own in the second half when it explores the brains of babies and children and really delves into how neuroplasticity shapes how we think and perceive ourselves and that the behaviours and attitudes we exhibit individually are more likely influenced by social conditioning as opposed to any pre-determined biological factors. The book took great care to debunk a lot of damaging ‘wack-a-mole’ theories that keep resurfacing in the press even if the studies that they quoted had been widely disproved. Overall, the book highlights how looking for gender differences in neuroscience is just the wrong tree to bark at – we are products of our environment and experiences and, therefore, we should ask more nuanced and multi-layered questions about how we behave and think in the context of social, economic, political and cultural influences instead of keep flogging that dead horse of biological determinism when it comes to gender differences."
282,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954421-vanessa,5,"A measured and thorough takedown of the science of “male” vs “female” brains, from the dawn of science to modern neuroscience studies. (Sadly, the latter seem just as prone as the former to massage results to emphasize female inferiority, even when the opposite result is found).Spoiler: we’re not that different. Once you control for shoddy science and brain size, there aren’t that many differences left - and many of those are shrinking over time (suggesting social rather than biological causes). Some supposed differences, like men’s superior spatial skills, turn out to be primarily environmental and can be trained (control for time spent playing video games and differences in spatial skill all but disappear). Ladies, play Tetris. It’s good for you. Other differences vary based on setting and context, like the phenomenon of “stereotype threat”. Tell women that “men normally do better on this task” and watch their performance plummet. (Interestingly the reverse, telling men that women are better at a task, does not have the same effect on their performance.)This is as much worth reading for the review of sex differences research, as for its broader examination of the ways in which scientific inquiry can fail to be impartial. How studies showing no differences are less likely to publish than ones finding differences (not necessarily for nefarious reasons, but because negative results are boring), how minor numerical differences can be twisted by university publicists or science media into “significant” findings, how studies on mice and hamsters are reported by mainstream media as conclusive evidence that men are more aggressive or women are more nurturing, etc. etc. etc. Take everything with a grain of salt."
283,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716778-e-s,4,"What if there were no “female” and “male” brains? In Gina Rippon’s debut novel, Gender and Our Brains, that’s precisely what she argues. Equal parts riveting, technical, and witty, Rippon breaks down scientific brain imaging studies, provides critical analyses of journalists’ attempts to solidify the theory of sex differences in the brain, and questions the gender stereotypes that remain prevalent today. Rippon begins her book with Gustave Le Bon’s questionable statement in 1881 that women’s brains were inferior, in fact, making their brains more comparable to gorillas than the highly developed minds of men. This very statement marks the theme for this book: the long-lasting rhetoric between what constitutes a male brain from a female brain. Rippon presents a series of what she terms “whack-a-mole” myths that still exist in society, including women being “born” to be nurturers and men’s destiny for logic-based roles. Biology isn’t the only factor to consider, Rippon urges her readers. Taking in sociological factors is one reason why neuroscience studies are so difficult to conduct, replicate, and analyze. Rippon challenges the idea of male and female brains, and even suggests that society should stop seeing them as separate entities, instead proposing that brain differences are down to the individual. Gender and Our Brains is the perfect supplement to a reader’s gender studies library and invites us to take a step back and look at gender brain difference articles with a critical eye. Readers who aren’t afraid of technical non-fiction and are passionate about the future of women will highly benefit from this book. "
284,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98372343-imogen-swaffer,5,"Gina Rippon dissects and debunks the pervasive myths of the “female brain” in an informative, amusing and easy to follow manner. The science throughout the book is in-depth and multilayered and her explanations of complex cerebral structures (think the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) are thorough whilst maintaining interest and relevance to the non-scientist reader.Her overriding message is the importance of neuro plasticity: that is to say that the brain is malleable and able to be shaped and reshaped by societal factors and life experiences. Contrary to research carried out over previous centuries which has shown ‘fundamental’ biological differences between the male and female brain, Rippon argues that such differences manifest due to the gendered world in which we live where different opportunities and expectations are available to men and women. Thanks to fMRI technology and developmental cognitive neuroscience, more and more evidence is demonstrating the overwhelming similarities between male and female brains at birth. In short, men do not ‘biologically’ possess superior spatial cognition whilst women are not ‘biologically’ more empathetic and less skilled at science. These are learned and practiced skills from repeated activation within cerebral structures, often spurred on by preconceived gender expectations and lived experiences throughout childhood and beyond. This book is a must-read to better understand the gender limitations within society: stereotypical gender roles, gender disparities in education and careers (STEM for example) and misinformed ideas around male and female hormones. Highly recommend."
285,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"Excellent book, though one that moves far beyond gender into the methods of science and of different sciences: social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, genetics, psychology and more... It is quite a technical read but worth its diligence because it sheds light on how we establish evidence, and how frequently this evidence is manipulated or transformed.Spoiler: in essence there is no clear gendered brain, their individual variability is larger than any gender signal. The author however does not get to this till the end of the book and as such she works through many details which are fascinating in their process technology and perverse in their manipulation of tools.The one big issue I have is that the author did not include philosophy as part of an investigation that is very close to problems of what is knowledge, truth, fact, measurement, definition etc... so that in many parts of the book the author takes as evidence a measure in the brain that may well not mean anything even if tightly correlated to its label. The reader remains exposed to neurojunk because they are not led through what we mean by knowledge, which sure,would be a huge discussion but could be resolved quite simply with ideas of scientific consensus.Frances Edwards who I was lucky enough to learn some Neuroscience from explained that something in these fields is only true when you have three corroborating studies where at least one is an independently funded population stufy with 1000s of subjects. Then it is true... everything else is still speculative evidence."
286,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9477823-mekon,4,"As someone who fits under the LGBT+ umbrella, I approached this book with some misgivings and open to have my own outlook challenged. Evidence that male and female brains are not significantly different is often taken up by those wishing to attack or negate the need for transsexual people to live in a gender other than that assigned at birth. This is not a book that makes such simplistic claims.The book takes a broad look at the history of medical research into the sex differences of brains, drawing in the prevalent societal views of the times. It covers the brain's structure, how it has been examined by tools such as FMRI and, tellingly, the selective and simplified way in which these studies are presented in media reports. It's an absorbing story, written in an accessible and entertaining manner that never undermines the seriousness of the subject matter.The book's conclusion suggests that a simple binary categorisation of people as either male or female fails to distinguish between any of our many human traits - which vary from person to person in ways entirely unconnected to sex or gender. To my mind it seems we're increasingly ready to reduce complex situations to false binary problems, so Rippon's well argued, intelligent and compassionate conclusion was a breath of fresh air to me.All in all, this was a book I enjoyed and learnt a lot from. I may have already forgotten some of the finer details of the brain's structure but I'm left with a strong sense of what the science says, how it's reported and what it means for our society."
287,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,3,"I’m a bit torn about this book. On one hand, it is clearly excellent because it provides a much-needed contra-argument against the prominent myths around gender and the brain. Prof. Rippon takes down many of these myths with expert knowledge, insight, and reflection. I was quite surprised about the sparse empirical work that the even prominent theories, like the systemising-empathising theory, are based on. Prof. Rippon also takes down many of the recurring tropes that feature in almost all documentaries on gender differences. For instance, the preference of male and female monkeys for boy or girl toys is much less clear than one may think from how often this study is mentioned in the debate on innate sex differences. However, I found other aspects of the book less convincing. There is a long section in the middle that provides a lot of background on research in developmental cognitive neuroscience that is only partially relevant for the discussion on sex differences in the brain. Many of the topics that are covered are probably familiar to anyone who has ever read a book on psychology (Sally-Anne task again, anyone?). Furthermore, the way that this research is summarised is at times confusing. For instance, the brain is compared to a smartphone that can either have updates on apps or get new components. I think the educated reader would have understood the scientific concept better without this analogy. I was also a bit irked by the different level of scrutiny that is applied to different research. The author is justifiably critical of the research that supports sex differences in the brain but then cites quite weak evidence to support theories that sex difference reflect different life experience. In sum, I think that the book is well worth reading for anyone with an interest in the psychology and neurobiology of sex differences, but that reader should keep their critical eye sharp when alternative theories are presented. "
288,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43746831-masnoon-majeed,4,"Ever since I studied sociology, back in 2008, as an O-levels student, I developed firm beliefs that gender is a social construction, and in Beauvoir's words, ""one is not born a woman, one becomes one"". Overall, the central insight I obtained from Rippon's book is that the becoming of a particular gender is not only social, but it is also cognitive and neurological. Our brains respond to specific stimuli in physical ways as well. These responses mean that being brought up as a woman can mould the brain in many ways. Similarly, from a cognitive perspective, the entire brain 'system', the heuristics, we employ to navigate the world, can fundamentally change. In short, the effects of gender socialization are well-beyond 'social'. Rippon also challenges a wide range of myths and identifies various problems with the dozens of studies published on ""gender difference"". Interestingly, I think this book is an excellent introduction to developmental psychology as well, as, through the lens of gender differences, one learns about the remarkable stages of brain development during childhood and the complex interaction of the brain with the environment. So, I think for someone who has not studied psychology, this will be an excellent book. Having said that the book might not be too insightful for advanced psychology students."
289,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264319-5haybear,4,"I am not usually a non-fiction book reader (unless you count music biographies). I picked up The Gendered Brain as part of an online feminist book club and I was equal parts excited and scared to dive into a science based book so close to finishing Gut by Giulia Enders.Thankfully, Gina Rippon has made psychology, neuroscience and biology pretty accessible in The Gendered Brain. I am no scientist by any stretch, but having studied some psychology units at university I did recognise a lot of the terminology and concepts. I don't feel like you need a background in psychology to get something out of this book but the limited experience I have certainly helped.I quickly found myself note-taking everytime I had an ""aha moment"" (there were many) and discussing these with my husband, friends and family whenever I had the chance. I'm pretty sure they all became sick of hearing about it, but there was just so much excellent information I had to share it with the world. Also talking through some of the more complex concepts definitely helped me to process them and form a greater understanding.I'll limit myself to one example from the many pages of notes I took in the interests of brevity:In 1968 Rudolph Moos (PHD) developed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionairre - a list of 46 symptoms related to menstruation that are overwhelmingly negative. In one study menstruating people were (falsely) told they were in the pre-menstrual phase of their cycle. It turns out these people were much more likely to report symptoms of PMS leading us to believe sometimes the idea of PMS is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I find this concept so wild! My whole life I have accepted PMS as a necessary evil. Something I and many many other people endure. The idea that it could be a social construct absolutely blew my mind.But this particular truth bomb has more to give: Moos questionairre, and most people's understanding of PMS, doesn't take into account the cognitive boost some people experience at certain points in their menstrual cycle. Verbal and spatial working memory, for example, tend to improve when oestrogen levels are higher. “There are very positive changes about the time of ovulation – improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.” As Rippon states, “I haven't come across an ‘ovulation euphoria questionnaire’”.So not only might my negative monthly symptoms be a psychologically ingrained concept, I have realised that I definitely have experienced ""ovulation euphoria"" and do on a regular basis.You'll have to take my word for it when I say this book hit me with a tsunami of the most excellent truth bombs that resonated with my personal experiences and made me question EVERYTHING at the same time.It's heavy going and I found it to be quite dense, but I found the information to be so enlightening it was worth chipping away at. I took regular breaks to let the information soak in and I found talking through some of the concepts really helpful in bedding them down in my head."
290,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38931322-zo,3,"TL:DR? There really is no significant difference between male and female brains. To treat these brains as if they are somehow different is leading to an enormous waste of human capital. Even teeny new baby brains are highly-complex social-cue readers and stereotypes simply continue to perpetuate. 2-3 year olds become gender police as they work furiously to figure out their place in the world. Children desire approval, and adolescents needs this even more powerfully from their peer groups. It is this, and not neuroscientific variance, that creates gulfs in what men and women do with their lives, forming preferences and abilities. Gina debunks all of the weird neuro-myths around male and female brains. There have been thousands of studies on male and female brains. Studies citing difference are far far more likely to get published and reported, though the more numerous studies showing similarities are ignored as they don't fit with society's confirmation bias that men and women are fundamentally different. Guess what? If we are, that's all down to society.This is a very academic book (for me) and it's taken me 4 months to read it - if you like your science light, this might not be for you. I'm relieved to be through it, but it does confirm how pervasive neuro-myths have been through tens to hundreds of years!"
291,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375203-jackie,4,"Another challenging read, #3 in my Quarantine Summer of Neuroscience. This was a well-reasoned and often entertaining book. The author, a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, analyzes scores of studies aimed at the ""difference between male and female brains,"" and argues convincingly that 1) even our newest brain imaging technology has presented only minor evidence of male-female differences, and 2) because humans love explanatory rules and stereotypes, even legitimate results are misrepresented in popular media--reinforcing the stereotypes. Further, 3) there's considerable evidence that cultural/cultural factors (or at least a tangle of social and brain factors) are the real source of observations that ""boys and girls are different starting in infancy or early childhood."" Gender stereotypes (perpetuated by pseudo-science) are harmful and limiting for girls AND boys, but have an especially destructive impact on the potential for girls to engage and succeed in science and technical fields--fields in which the world seriously needs more trained professionals. So, turn on your critical thinking when you read articles in your Google feed with sweeping titles like ""New Evidence of the Real Difference Between Men and Women."" Okay. I thought I'd be too tired to write that review."

Didn’t hook me at the beginning, although there were some interesting passages I skimmed (maybe just read the conclusion and go read any chapters they summarize that sound interesting to you).More frustrating was that twice (I convinced myself I was reading too much into it the first time) they had a real opportunity to look at the limited research on trans individuals and chose not to. It literally says this halfway through the book: ‘it is obviously ethically difficult to explore the causal role of hormones in humans by manipulating hormone levels and watching the effects’ and then goes on to describe literature on some DSD groups. Big, missed opportunity to really explore some interesting literature on people (who have provided informed consent to be on hormones!) and help describe the gaps that are there and would be worth filling.At the very end they briefly mentioned that transgender people do exist, and that debunking a difference between male and female brains might help trans folk, but I still think there was not nearly enough time spent on this topic.

293,184792476X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9015434-laura,4,"This book could be summarised as ""we are what we do"". Essentially, our brains aren't set in stone, and nor are the characteristics of our brains (, behaviours, personalities). When we do something, our brain builds the connections etc so that we'll do that thing more effectively in future. As such, things like gender roles act as a 'strait-jacket' (in the author's words) for our brains, limiting our capabilities through exposing us to some things--and not others--as well as our expectations of ourselves.I didn't learn a HUGE amount from this book, but that's primarily because I do a lot of feminist reading as well as a lot around neuroscience--and particularly prediction mechanisms--for my PhD. As you do.I will, however, be throwing this book at the next person who claims women ""can't do math/read a map/use a hammer"" because we're just ""not made that way"". It's all hogwash. Boo to evolutionary psychology and the retrograde conceptions of humanity and our brains in which it's embedded."

In The Gendered Brain, neuroscientist Gina Rippon delves deep into the topic of whether or not we actually have 'female brains' and 'male brains' in a scientific sense, and how much of the perceived brain differences actually depend on societal attitudes and performativity of gender.This book definitely gripped me and gave me lots to think about, but overall I found the structure to be too long and meandering, often repetitive to the point where it was no longer repetitive in an educational sense, but in a more frustrating sense. However, the merit and importance of this book should not be understated, and I do recommend it for everyone even though I feel it could have done with being cut down a bit."

She argues that the world and the society in which we grow up influences our neurological development to a much greater extent than our sex - according to her, our brains are ""plastic"" and thus moulded by the social circumstances and interactions we find ourselves in. ""The Gendered Brain"" is an extremely interesting and accessible account of today's scientific knowledge about the subject and has provided me with some food for though especially concerning the education of some possible future sons and daughters."

The conclusion? As I already suspected, having often been classified a woman with a male brain, is that the real difference is the environment in which the individual grows up and the stimuli he/she is subjected to. Even today too little is done to stimulate girls to express their potential, and still (unfortunately) rare are the cases in which parents and educators - especially mothers, I regret to say - don't apply stereotypes to the frame of reference in which their daughters have to move. In the meantime, nonsense continues to have resonance boxes in the form of magazine headlines and today, with social media, posts that carry on a social stigma towards women."

It made me realize how little brains are understood and that the traditional concept that one part of the brain is solely responsible for one thing, is rarely true. Also brains are incredibly plastic! Which gives me hope for people who want to improve themselves/ learn new skills. I also enjoyed reading about some of the flaws of science communication (ie ""stickibility"" of early findings, because they might support a stereotype; researchers finding it easier to publish when differences are found; journalists role in communicating science poorly). Drawback: Very repetitive and not well-structured, in my opinion. Could have integrated the case studies better.

Rippon's evisceration of classic gender myths and the shitty studies that support them is well-worth the read. Unfortunately, the latter two-thirds of the book felt aimless and at times, self-contradictory. For example, early in the book Rippon casts serious doubt upon the usefulness of fMRI studies — pointing out that fMRIs are easy to fudge and that the whole idea of particular areas of the brain being responsible for particular things is misguided. But later on, Rippon uncritically refers to more than one fMRI study that supports her point. These discrepancies were at first confusing, then disappointing, and eventually kind of irritating."

Other times it feels like a confusion of stats, random, and more of just a look at how poorly done most research has been. It drags a bit 2/3s in as many books of this type do, but to make it shorter might make it seem that the writer didnt do full diligence to the topic. Overall it was a good look at how complex the idea of gender is and how ingrained it is in culture that it has made it very difficult to study scientifically without bias."
