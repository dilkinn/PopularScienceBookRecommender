I was not expecting to read so much about the atomic bombs at the start of this book, but it is logical - it is where the idea of nuclear fusion starts.This book takes you through the history of the nuclear fusion research in a chronological way. I feel the book is not totally objective everywhere, closer to the end it gets clearer why. But I did not mind that a lot, I've read this to understand the scientific process of nuclear fusion better. I've achieved that goals, and I've learned a lot about the politics and egos involved.This book shows you science is more than just that single breakthrough. It is about a lot more, and sometimes things go not according to plan. This book shows you that is all part of the process. "
1,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"There are plenty of books about the discovery of radioactivity, the Manhattan project, the atomic bomb and nuclear fission in general. This book focuses on fission's lesser-known cousin, nuclear fusion, the process that generates the energy we receive from the sun and other stars. The red thread through this book is the belief that lab- or reactor-generated fusion could be a cheap and reliable source of energy, a clean alternative to the dangers of the classic nuclear reactors. As the author shows, this belief has repeatedly been shown to be erroneous, or at least hugely optimistic. He is particularly interested in the two or three times that scientists announced they had achieved fusion by experiments that other scientists then showed were wrong (think of the Pons and Fleischman Cold Fusion debacle in the late eighties). He also does a good job of describing the congressional and international politics involved in the decisions to build or not build the increasingly complex and expensive reactors that the ""believers"" wanted to build. I thought that the science itself was a bit summarily treated. The illustrations were okay, nothing special. The diagrams of various experiments and reactions could have been clearer. Still, overall this was an enjoyable book for those what ever became of nuclear fusion."
2,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"Another really well-researched (fusion seems to be a pet interest of the author) and well-written book. I found it interesting that the Mr. Seife has migrated from being a science reporter to a journalism professor. He certainly is qualified both from his experiences as a reporter and the quality of his work.One of the things I learned from this book is that we are still decades (or more) away from a viable method of using fusion as a power source.Before reading it, I knew of fusion bombs (the ""super"" as it was referred to during and after The Manhattan Project), attempts to use magnetic fields and lasers to compress & confine plasmas for fusion, and, of course, the infamous ""Cold Fusion"" scandal.What I didn't know was that there have been other attempts (some successful, some not) to create ""table-top"" fusion. In fact the earliest such attempt was by Philo Farnsworth (the same man that invented electronic television in 1927). He came up with an idea in the late '50s and actually created fusion with a fairly cheap and simple apparatus. As have several people (including at least two teenagers) that applied his basic concept.And, there was a whole second family of failed table top fusion experiments that were initially promising, but proven to be unworkable.It's a great read even if you know little about the history and science behind at A-bomb, the H-Bomb, or nuclear reactors. There is enough explanation of concepts and terms to help those who need it, without making those in-the-know annoyed.A final ""fun fact"": Back when the rest of The Manhattan Project was working on the fission bomb, Edward Teller was mostly working on his concept of ""The Super"" of fusion bomb. In his office at Los Alamos, he would write down his blackboard each increasingly powerful device that he conceived along with its delivery method. The last entry on the board had ""back yard"" written next to it. It was so powerful that the human race would be wiped out no matter where it was set off."
3,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,2,"The world's first fission bomb (Trinity) was exploded in 1945, and the world's first fission power plant (in Obninsk, Russia) was connected to the grid in 1954, 9 years later. The world's first fusion bomb (Ivy Mike) was exploded in 1952. We'll be lucky if the fusion power plants are connected to the grid in 2052, 100 years later. The difference is so large because a fission power plant has solid fuel rods and either solid or liquid moderator, and the fuel in a fusion power plant is plasma, and it took decades to understand how difficult it is to make plasma stable. In Cory Hall at UC Berkeley in the 1990s there was an exhibit made by a graduate student of plasma physics: a plastic aquarium holding alcohol and glycerin colored with different dyes, and a little knob-regulated electric motor shaking it. When the shaking speed was small, the boundary between the two liquids was well-defined, but when it increased, the boundary became a mess. For decades, scientists have said that practical fusion is 20 years away, but this has been a moving target, Seife says because of wishful thinking. A fusion power plant would be inherently safe from Chernobyl-type disasters; it would produce a lot less radioactive waste than a fission power plant; peak deuterium would never come, unlike peak uranium. ITER (which is pronounced ""eater"") is supposed to be finished in 2018, but such projects often go over budget and over the deadline. When I thought about it, I realized that even if a fusion device produces less energy than what was put into it, you can put uranium and plutonium around it and use it as a neutron source for a a subcritical fission reactor, and have some of the advantages of a pure fusion power plant. An Internet search showed that this idea was not original, and in fact such experiments are planned for ITER."
4,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/607825-victor,3,"I thought the book had an excellent start, but disagreed with the tone the book took toward the end, and especially its conclusions. The author seems to think believe that we somehow can't achieve reliable and useful fusion because of the hubris of many scientists that work on the problem. It's as if the human difficulties of politics, ego, etc are the main barrier rather than the monumental technical difficulties."
5,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,4,"A nice history of fusion, from Teller through the National Ignition Facility. Fairly negative about fusion, very negative about Teller. The author was a science journalist for Science during the cold fusion debacle, which he gives a behind-the-scenes description of. One of the better books I've seen about how science really works."
6,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32724160-eden-thompson,4,"From my book blog www.JetBlackDragonfly.blogspot.comThe books of Charles Seife are always fascinating to me, well spoken and inviting no matter what the subject. He was a science reporter turned journalism professor and writes science I can enjoy. I've read three so far and find them entertaining on subjects that may not seem so welcoming.Just look at that cover! The concept and creation of giant superconductors is mind boggling to me - a world so far from my own - they are totally fascinating.It's an informal history of fusion research from the Manhattan project in the 1950's to the projected working fusion reactor in 2030. By that I mean, it might not be comprehensive, but for me, it was the perfect amount. Seife details the politics, development, and uses of nuclear weapons, and then into the race for harnessing fusion power - both high temperature and cold fusion. I am only into science as far as my interest in the concepts and his writing style simplified the process of thermonuclear reactions so that I could enjoy and understand it. He describes the many attempts over the years to achieve true fusion - some even at the expense of spending as much power was it took to create - and the competing teams of scientists working towards it.This was the most fascinating part to me, the human side of the endeavour. Seife goes into the many ways scientists conceive creating a sustainable, zero-energy fusion reaction, so far without success. There are millions of dollars spent on each attempt for the future of fusion power itself, and whether it was true fusion or just a phenomena that mimicked that can be overlook in the race for glory. Claims could be made for success, only to be investigated as non-existant or flawed. The peer-review system the scientists go through to claim their prize and the problems that reveals was the most fascinating part of the book - the human side of success and failure.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in science, an enjoyable and informative glimpse into the world of science."
7,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,3,"Sun in a Bottle (2008) by Charles Seife looks at the history of fusion research. Seife starts with a look at nuclear weapons and leads into the development of various attempts to generate power with fusion.The book looks at how Stellarators and then Tokomaks and various other devices have attempted to achieve fusion. Seife also gives considerable coverage to claims of fusion that have been shown to be false. First the claims of Richter in Argentina, then Cold Fusion and then bubble fusion. Seife was a reporter for science when the bubble fusion claims broke.Finally ITER's slow progress is described and Seife ends oddly with a conclusion that self-deception is a major part of fusion research. It's not a strong ending. Sun in a Bottle isn't a bad book, but the book A Piece of the Sun is definitely a better history of fusion. However, there is still a lot of interesting information about fusion research in the book. "
8,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69467178-ed-romano,5,"Charles Seife does a magnificent job recounting the marvels and failures of the quest for sustainable fusion, as it continues today. It's a story complete with characters forlorn, achieving the heights of fame and then falling from grace, like Pons and Fleischmann. But other than the personal stories, Seife is a master storyteller of things scientific and technical, giving masterful overviews of the instabilities in current platforms -- namely Inertial and Magnetic Confinement Fusion. Before the culmination into current ventures he lays the ground for the nuclear fusion process, describing in great textbook-worthy detail on how such events proceed. As a former scientist in one such project, I was elated to see the story told so keenly."
9,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79125132-jeffrey-rennie,5,"A very interesting history of the scientific pursuit of nuclear fusion.Chapter 8 played out like a soap opera, where the author spent some time defending his actions, so I skipped over a lot of the drama. But the rest of the book was about science and the people sciencing.The hidden gem in this book is that a commercial fusion power plant, assuming humanity could ever build one, would generate nearly as much nuclear waste as a fission power plant. Anyone who tells you fusion will give us clean energy isn't telling you the whole story. Instead of fusion power plants, the author recommends newer fission power plant designs like the pebble reactor, and my own research into the subject leads me to the same conclusion."
10,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26147636-daniel-shea,5,Easily Digestible ScienceThis was well written and understandable to a non-scientist.The author gives a historical overview as well as current obstacles to fusion reactor development.
11,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50617219-rayma-nilsson,4,History combined with a teaching of fusionCharles is very good at telling an historical story while at the same time explaining scientific concepts. Great read and I recommend it. 
12,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73033622-scott-margo,4,Well written description of the problems with fusion power.
13,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,5,"This book is just about the perfect thing to read for a quick, easy explanation and history of fusion and its role in society.The book starts off talking about the politics and development of nuclear weapons. This section, like most parts of the book, doesn't go very deep into the subject -- but then again, a full treatment has been the subject of other (very good) books. The next chapter talks about the physics of fusion reactions and weapons. I think it does a great job of balancing out a real description of what's happening with a directness that keeps it simple to understand.The book moves into describing some of the politics of nuclear weapons. Again, it's a good overview -- a full treatment could more than cover a thick book of its own. It also describes some of the bizarre proposed peaceful uses of nuclear weapons, such as weather control. This chapter also transitions into the heart of the matter of this book: fusion power.The first chapter of fusion power involves efforts in the 50's to create true high-temperature controlled thermonuclear reactions. The book describes the difficulties that the first researchers encountered, and the difficulties of determining exactly how successful they were: whether they achieved a true fusion reaction, or whether some other phenomenon was only giving that appearance. The following chapter describes later attempts at achieving break-even fusion power: a reaction that delivers back as much power as it took to start.After talking about high-temperature fusion reactions, the book describes the history of cold fusion attempts. I remember cold fusion announcements and later realization, but this book helped fill out the picture of what was really attempted, and how it came to be so public.This book is a pretty compelling combination of physics, politics, and history. If there's any part of the discussed topics that interests you, you can find a book that covers it in more depth, but I don't think you'll find a better one that ties all of the topics together."
14,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13465470-andres-l,5,"	""Sun in a Bottle"", by Charles Seife, is a great expository book. Throughout the book are stories after stories of how people tried to unleash the power of the sun on planet earth. It started with the Manhattan project. Oppenheimer was in charge of the operation. However, the atomic bomb was not enough for Edward Teller. He did everything he could to build a fusion device, to build the H-Bomb. That's when it all started. Teller was obsessed with harnessing the power of fusion. He saw nuclear fusion as the answer to just about anything. Later on, several different scientist attempt to create fusion for different reasons. One of the main ones is an alternative energy source. Scientist attempt different methods from lasers to magnets. All through history, people lie, cheat, and deceive others to try to accomplish fusion. I truly enjoyed this book. It is very thorough. Throughout the book are diagrams to help understand just how things work. Bundles of information are packed into an understandable piece of text. I truly enjoyed this book. I would relate to Oppenheimer. He understood lots of things. One of the quotes from the book was ""why, Oppenheimer knows about everything. He can talk to you about anything you bring up. Well, not exactly, I guess there are a few things he doesn't know about. He doesn't know anything about sports."" That is similar to me. (Besides the knowing everything part). I can talk about anything academically. However, if you mention sports, I don't understand most of it. However, Oppenheimer did eventually start to get a little weird. But then again, lots of scientist did. I truly enjoyed this book. I wouldn't change a single thing. It was great. It definitely deserved five stars. I recommend this to any science lover. They will love this book. I know I did. "
15,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"‘Sun in a Bottle’ examines nuclear fusion – the process by which multiple atomic nuclei join together to form a single heavier nucleus and a release of energy, and the force that powers the sun. Scientists were first able to create a fusion reaction in the form of a hydrogen bomb in the 1950’s and ever since have been looking for a more beneficial use of the phenomenon as a source of clean energy. Charles Seife describes the history of these efforts, and as the subtitle alludes, their repeated and continuing failures. Efforts to use fusion as an energy source have been going on for the past 50 years with billions having been spent on research. Along the way the path has been littered with the careers of physicists and chemists who have deluded themselves and others as to whether fusion (or it’s seedier pseudo-science counterpart … cold fusion) could be achieved. The obvious allure of cheap and abundant energy has kept the dream alive even if fusion is not as clean as one would like, or cheap, or easy. As Seife points out, the promise of fusion energy has always been 10 years in the future. There is no evidence that this time horizon is about to change. The book is very well written and geared towards the general science reader and does not require any prior knowledge of physics. As a science writer, Seife knows how to keep the story interesting and informative at the same time. My only complaint of the book is that the illustrations are extremely crude. They look as though they were created by a child in PowerPoint using the ‘shapes’ tool and are often so primitive that they confuse rather than illuminate the point the author is trying to convey. "
16,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976229-joshua,5,"In 1939, Hans Bethe submitted a scientific paper which revealed how the stars, and our sun, convert matter into vast amounts of energy, just as Einstein had theorized, by fusing light elements together. Ever since, the governments of the industrialized nations have spent billions of dollars in searching for a way to bring that energy to earth; the holy grail of generating virtually unlimited energy from cheap, abundant hydrogen. Except for the uncontrolled destructive power of the hydrogen bomb, that effort has been, to this point, a dismal failure. And yet, billions of dollars continue to be thrown into the black hole of fusion power generation; such is it's lure.Charles Seife has written a concise, easy to read history of the efforts to achieve fusion power and of the current state of that quest. Seife is not a scientist. He is a science journalist with a long and impressive resume and this, I am convinced, is what makes ""Sun in a Bottle"" such an enjoyable book. He doesn't bog you down with dry science. He presents the subject in the best tradition of investigative journalism and with the literary skills to make it exciting and entertaining.Bottom line: I enjoyed ""Sun in a Bottle"" so much that I had my library procure a copy of Seife's award winning book from 2000, ""Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea,"" which it did and which I am currently reading with great relish. What fun! "
17,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1418390-adam,4,"'Sun in a Bottle' by Charles Seife is not just about the history of fusion-This book is about the lives of those affected by fusion & about the state of the world as fusion technology progressed throughout the years. This brutally honest account of the rise and decline of fusion research is gripping and educational, as Seife begins by explaining how fusion works as well as the early projects that prefaced the Fusion Age (such as the Manhattan Project and Project Plowshare, which was a plan to use atomics for 'peaceful' purposes). He then begins to tell stories of those involved in early fusion research, and how their lives took turns for the better (or worse). Finally, he finishes his book by discussing how science and research is perception-free despite the claims of researchers; in other words, how science frees scientists from what they 'want' to see and reveals the true face of nature.I was surprised by this gem. I picked it up as a way to whittle the time away during bus rides and breaks, but I found myself poring over the novel a 3 or 4 in the morning! 'Sun in a Bottle' starts quickly, moves faster, and never lets you go. Ultimately, though, it is a sad account of the current state of fusion research, of tokamaks and high-powered lasers, of broken careers and lies and fringe science. A little depressing, true-Nevertheless you must check this out! "
18,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/268947-austin-larson,3,"I picked this one up as a companion to the book I read on Uranium and fission. In this case, the book has the same starting point - the Manhattan Project during world war two - but continues to tell the story of the American weapons program after the war as they turner their efforts from nuclear fission weapons (uranium and plutonium bombs) to fusion weapons (thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs). After the development of the first weapons, thoughts quickly turned to nuclear fusion as a power source. From the 1950s to the present, there have been large scale government projects around the world trying to use either magnetism or lasers to confine a fission reaction and obtain energy from it. We've made surprisingly little progress in that time. Seife's interest in the subject seems to have derived from an episode when he worked for Science Magazine at a time when it published a study claiming to have achieved ""bubble fusion."" His personal story is one of the more engrossing chapters in the book. Seife left the publication with a pessimistic view of the potential for fusion to ever provide useful energy and concludes that the billion dollars that have gone toward fusion research would have been better spent on improving nuclear fission. "
19,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1018935-zed,4,"This book tells the tale of fusion research, describing the convoluted path researchers have taken to get to our present point, and highlighting how tenuous the predictions of limitless power have been all along the way (at present the belief is that we will have a working fusion reactor design by 2030--wishful thinking given the pattern of prediction to date!). While the book is quite informative, the underlying theme is disturbing--the authors working assumption is that fusion research is tainted by big egos, greed, politics and wishful thinking, which leads to alot of wasted money and effort for no obvious gain. Its yet another indication that our ideals regarding scientific research are far outmatched by human nature and a reminder that science still has much to learn about nature.It is notable that the story is not unique. Clean fission, room temperature superconductors, hihgly efficient solar panels, and infinitely scalable electric power generators have all been problems researchers have predicted would be solved prior to the 21st century. The goals have spawaned much exceptional research, but the problems remain, and the unfulfilled predictions keep coming... "
20,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7800037-aaron-guest,4,"A very solid primer on the subject of fusion energy. Compelling voice -- the voice of a journalist-- made the first part of the book easy and exciting to read. However when he comes to ""Bubble Fusion"" he comes at it from a different angle. One he was enmeshed in and could offer a different take than previous chapters, but not one that offered the same objective view of the ideas. This of course led to his over all conclusion which, in the history of scientific discoveries, reeks of the same arrogant ""it'll never work"" that prevents science from moving forward in the manner science tends to. His perspective by the end was ""the only way to make fusion work is from one giant leap of a discovery and that just won't happen so we should give up on this altogether"". Seems to me science advances in incremental steps that pave the way for stellar breakthroughs. The wall has to be weakened enough before it can be torn down. That said I like the book. Appreciated his authority on the subject as an experienced science writer. Could have just taken a more consistent voice throughout the book. "
21,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"Really interesting history of fusion science, and the narrator is kind of great--he totally sounds like a 1950s TV or radio announcer. Seife starts with the building of the first fission weapons and the desire to build more powerful fusion bombs up through all the many different ways scientists have attempted to come up with a way to create a sustainable, zero energy fusion reaction--so far, and for the forseeable future, without success. Several folks have complained about the way Seife goes into the scientific peer review system and how sometimes that breaks down, as happened with the bubble fusion paper published in Science Magazine. I actually found that part really interesting and relevant, and I think it's important that folks are aware that sometimes the lines between science and politics and personal agendas can be blurred. Seife definitely focuses more on the mistakes than on the progress made, but I was entertained and informed by this book, and would recommend it if you're someone who has an interest in this sort of thing."
22,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2589619-chip,4,"I can now tell the difference between a Stellerator and a Tevatron! Going into this book I knew a bare minimum of the history of the Fusion race, but was pleasantly surprised to learn there was much more to the story. An especially timely book, as CERN comes online and there are tantalizing clues that the Higgs boson has been ""found"" (if you can call a blip on a graph ""found""). There is much space devoted to ""cold fusion"" which, if it were possible, would be lighting up the cosmos in place of stars. Instead we have stars spread out across an interstellar darkness; ergo cold fusion does not happen. The chapter on fair disclosure of the author's role in debunking the latest cold fusion fantasy was the weakest part of the book - I would have been fine with a mention in an afterword. Otherwise, an excellent treatment for the layman (that's me) on nuclear fusion. This book is a keeper."
23,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11017591-sam-knowles,5,"Seife actually does a great job in the making of this--the thing that suprises me though, is that after spending some time looking at the reviews made by others, they seem to give it a bad rating because of the Authors tone and writing style. Let me make this very clear, this is SUBJECTIVE WRITING, meaning the writer does take a side in his arguments (antagonistic to fusion, obviously)but puts feeling in his work, making it entertaining. Some may be offended by hearing him talk about how attaining the power of the stars may seem two points to impossible (it actually is), without a doubt it is one of the most difficult things to mankind.I support fusion research, and he does too, but he does indeed have doubts about it as many people do. So personally I don't blame him about using this kind of tone, in this book you will see how many people have literally gone mad because of there pursuits to harness the power of the sun."
24,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374721-jeremy,4,"A very engaging read, it offers a compelling history of the quest for obtaining power from fusion. It builds in a logical order, providing the necessary background to make all the information attainable, and breaks down the various methods in an easily understandable way. The author occasionally becomes the topic of the book, but generally in a way that doesn't detract from the overall story.My only disappointment was to finish the book and realize just how unlikely fusion power really is as a source of clean power. Instead, it is much more likely to be a continued and highly destructive weapon in our war arsenal, or a series of entertaining footnotes like Cold Fusion and Bubble Fusion. That said, I am compelled to continue to look for articles on the progress of the NIF lasers and ITER international tokamak from time to time, curious to see where it leads."
25,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7147893-tom,4,"Because I'm a nerd, I find fusion very interesting, which is why I wanted this book. But in fact I think just about anyone who enjoys tales of geniuses driven mad by obsession (and there are LOTS of them in this book) will find a good read here. Along the way there is, of course, some physics, but the author does an excellent job of making it accessible to the layman. Ultimately, the author is skeptical about the immediate future of fusion as an energy source, and after reading this book I tend to agree with him. Your reaction may be different, but this is still a history of scientific obsession worth reading."
26,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10313802-jeff,4,"An excellent overview of the continued failure to make fusion a viable form of energy production from a broad, though scientifically grounded, perspective. Only one star off for the conclusion, which is a shill for nuclear (fission) power and ""carbon sequestration."" Unfortunately, the author is himself invested in the myth of progress; this leaves the better questions about consumption and unrealistic expectations of our current civilisation unasked and unaddressed. Nonetheless, it is an excellent, if sometimes horrifying, read of our foolish (and doomed) obsession with dreams of limitless energy."
27,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1722363-evan,4,"Covers everything you ever wanted to know about fusion energy, and why we've spent hudreds of billions of dollars over 60 years trying to harness fusion for peaceful purposes, with almost complete failure. The explanation of the physics involved is very simple, and is detailed enough to give a clear understanding of what's happening inside modern tokamaks and laser fusin devices. Also covers the cold fusion fiasco in detail, which reads as a cautionary tale for researchers in any field for complete scientific honesty."
28,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3117699-gargamelscat,4,Clear concise explanations without the vague popular science handwaving that is so prevalent and entertaining.Before this book I had been wondering if the multi-billion Euro ITER project was going to finally do the business and it answered that question - not impossible but bloody unlikely.At least the effort will keep those physicists involved off the streets.It also really brought home that science too is a blood sport.
29,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2726875-filipe-dias,4,"Wonderful insight on the history of Fusion and the dreams of Scientists and the Public on the infinite energy. The dream to save Humanity forever.Alas it has not come to it, maybe will never be economically feasible, yet such dreams are never dead, and the book presents many moments where light was seen at the end of the tunnel, but Nature always had something instored for the believers.Very interesting for anyone who enjoys Science books and Humanity's dreams and deceptions."

The literary style was a little dry, but certainly not clunky and amateurish that you find in a lot of the genre. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the history of the Cold War and ""big science."""
31,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4471828-philip-hollenback,4,"This was a thoroughly enjoying (yet depressing) overview of the state of fusion research. It provides a good explanation for why sustained power positive fusion is always '30 years in the future'.After I read this book I was left somewhat depressed. Apparently fusion is basically a pipe dream, and we would be better of developing fission to supply the energy needs of our planet. Oh well."
32,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588430-david-r,3,"This one started well, and on point, but too rapidly became a vehicle inordinate assaults on the ""cold fusionists"" (I only quibble about the amount of attention given these incidents). What was odd is that Seife, despite making a substantial case for ending the fusion Grail quest, never reaches the obvious conclusion that it's a doomed quest."
33,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5779932-chris-rock,4,"A surprisingly accessible book, considering the subject. You still need to be interested in science and familiar with the basics to enjoy it, but if you are, it's very interesting.I especially liked the last chapter where he took all the overinflated hype around fusion attempts to teach more on the proper process of science. I was surprised at how little I knew about modern fusion science."
34,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15090646-bridget,4,"Despite a few points where the theory of evolution is 'verified', I enjoyed this book very much. It gives a clear, even-handed view of the history and basic science of nuclear fusion. You do have to be of a scientific bent to understand some of the concepts he presents, but overall it is an enjoyable read for anyone who wants to know more about nuclear fusion in all its forms."
35,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10045735-chuck,4,This is the story of the many attempts to build a fusion reactor. Seife writes well and the book was a pleasure to read. At the end of the book he reveals that he's a skeptic when it comes to the possibility of a fusion reactor becoming feasible in the foreseeable future. I found his arguments compelling.
36,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,4,"Very nice read about the history of fusion science. This book taught me a lot about the potentially ""limitless"" supply of energy, and how the quest to achieve breakeven had a powerful effect on many scientists. It will be interesting to read a book like this in another 20-30 years, to see whether we are still spinning our wheels or have actually made a legitimate breakthrough. "
37,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2433708-simon,3,"This book was great! Learned a lot about the science of nuclear fusion and bombs and related topics. However, it will crush the hopes of the wishful thinker in regards to our world solving an energy crisis."
38,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2577711-andy,3,"A quick read. The book comes on strong but breaks down as it dwells too long on the example of cold fusion as a breakdown in the peer review process. Overall, a good book if you want a quick introduction to the technology and the historical context in which the competing programs begun."
39,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1380062-fred,4,"Governments continue to pour billion annually into the scientific efforts to master fusion as a cheap source of energy. Seife makes a strong case for viewing this expensive search as nothing more than ""wishful thinking."" Very easy read for non-scientists."
40,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3,"Fusion research…we're always 20-30 years from successful power production from nuclear fusion. The author covers both the magnetic, & starting in the 1970s, laser approaches, as well as the cold & bubble fusion controversies"
41,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2381268-troy-rockwood,4,This is a very interesting book. I'm glad to have read it. He talks about all the things that have happened during man's quest for atomic fusion (including cold fusion.) I feel that I can understand better the problems and controversy surrounding fusion today.
42,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983193-peter,4,"A good historical review of fusion science, but ultimately very depressing as the authors conclusion is that ""Fusion is too hard and we shouldn't pursue it"". "
43,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,4,I'm not a technical person but found this book to be understandable and enjoyable. A very nice overview of the search for viable fusion generation. The book not counting footnotes is 235 pages long.

45,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/963587-david-biello,3,"that the science of fusion is a long time coming and reporters should never put their own experiences reporting into a book. it's uninteresting, even to another reporter!"
46,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3264760-mark-janowiak,3,"The falures to acheive fusion. Nice little portait of Edward Teller as the Mad Bomber that he was, tho"
47,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/202709-willow,3,"I don't agree with his conclusions, but I enjoyed this history of Fusion science quite a bit. Seife's writing is a little casual at times, but it makes a difficult subject easy to digest."
48,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94296-david,5,If you want to be able to understand why nuclear fusion is a pipe dream read this book. Or if you just want to be educated and entertained

51,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11997441-robert-edmondson,4,"I enjoyed the book, it was very informative but the subject was new to me and way over my head scientifically. I learned a lot."
52,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8965947-chris,4,I didn't think I would like this as much as I did.

58,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9999664-harry,4,Enlightening review of the efforts up to date to create a controlled Fusion reactor that creates more energy than it consumes. Lots of great stories about key personalities such as Edward Teller. 
59,0670020338,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505373-ed,4,Excellent book on the history of fusion and why we still haven't figured out how to make a fusion reactor.
