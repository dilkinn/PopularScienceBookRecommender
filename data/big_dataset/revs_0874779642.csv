0,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6519460-d-m-kenyon,4,"Jeremy Narby's Cosmic Serpent is a densely academic book that is 50% footnotes. This not light reading, but on the other hand it is essential reading. Narby's premise is that hallucinogenic drugs used by shaman in the Western Amazon actually give them access to medicinal information through knowledge coded in DNA. This would be a rather bizarre premise except for the fact that Narby is a trained PhD. in anthropology and his work is based an extensive survey of academic materials across numerous disciplines.His journey starts with his experience in the Western Amazon basin where he was invited to try powerful hallucinogen called ""ayahuasca"". This compound, by itself is mystifying because it is made through a complex chemical process that one would not expect would be within the reach of native Amazonian chemistry. And yet, ayahuasca is used throughout the Amazon rain forest as an access to a hallucinatory world where images of spirits inform shaman how to use the hidden power of the plant life in the Amazon rain forest cure a very broad spectrum of disease. Only in the past decades have pharmaceutical companies invade the province of these shaman to start mining for botanical compounds to patent and basically steal from the indigenous population.More than an anthropological account of how shaman use hallucination to find cures for disease, The Cosmic Serpent is a challenge to Western rationalism and modern science. Narby calls into serious question the limits of the scientific process and how we come to know things int he industrialized world. His argument is actually quite convincing as he punches holes in rational constructive thinking and makes the case for completely different and more intuitive platform of knowledge.While many in the scientific world have scoffed at his theories, Jeremy Narby has succeeded at least in throwing a monkey wrench in the the more-myth-than-truth paradigm of science and has opened the door for inquiry into what may prove to be the future of human knowledge."

4,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1689857-jenny,3,"Let's start with what I liked.I like how Narby takes a deconstructionist approach to anthropology. I like how he fearlessly points out the cultural biases and confirmation bias of the scientific method. I love Narby's cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, ""big picture"" approach. I like how he tries to find evidentiary support for all of his claims. I like that he wrote for a regular, non-academic audience. I like that he framed his theory in the context of a story.As you can see, there are a lot of positive things about this book!Now, for what I didn't care for: his actual theory.(view spoiler)[Narby claims that shamanistic practices, particularly the extremely hallucinogenic rituals of the Western Amazonian peoples, allow a person's consciousness to perceive reality on a molecular level. While in this hallucinogenic state, a person can communicate with their own DNA through images and music. Furthermore, he claims that DNA itself is conscious and can talk to the DNA in any other life form through light waves, so when you establish contact with your own DNA, you also have access to all the knowledge in all the DNA in the world. This explains the advanced botanical knowledge of indigenous peoples, as well as the extremely common mythological imagery across the world of a divine creator represented by a ""twinned snake"" (the double helix structure of the DNA molecule). Also, DNA is from space and is consciously controlling the course of evolution.  (hide spoiler)]This is an idea of spirituality that, surprisingly, I feel like I could get behind. I've been intrigued by shamanism and the religious experiences associated with hallucinogens for years; I think there's a lot there that we don't understand. The combination of spirituality and science feels like it's on the right track to me, and I've always liked the idea of SOMETHING that connects all the living creatures on the planet (let's call it the over-soul, to borrow a term from Emerson), even if I've never actually felt such a connection myself.That being said, I just. Don't. Buy it. Each successive chapter makes a wilder claim, and as they say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I don't think Narby provides anywhere near enough evidence to support his theory (though to be fair, he makes a valiant effort and does indeed support his ideas better than I expected him to). By the end, I decided he had a great idea for a sci-fi/fantasy piece, something along the lines of the back half of the Ender series, but not much of a credible scientific theory.Still, it was definitely an interesting read. I can think of several people I know who would eat this up, so to them, I say go for it."
5,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656276-walter,1,"This was a slightly crazy book by an anthropologist who has taken too many hallucinogenic ""ayahuasca journeys"". He has a thesis that ayahuasca allows shamans to communicate with nature via DNA. He proposes that DNA crystals in cells can receive information from biophotonic emissions and that all life is interacting in this way. I could have entertained his ideas if he presented them differently. He was very antagonistic to Western science, but still attempted to take advantage of it's legitimacy to prop up his theories about nature. I was very annoyed by this book. "
6,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31053312-emily,3,"This is the story of an excellent thought experiment, and for this reason I have learned much. However, as a geneticist researcher myself, I have to say that Narby is an excellent anthropologist but a dirt poor biologist. His hypothesis is falsifiable and is therefore ""scientific"" but it is a poor hypothesis rooted in metaphor. I realize this was published two decades ago and the study of biology doesn't stand still, so evidence used by Narby (e.g., whale evolution, lack of complex pre-Cambrian fossil evidence) no longer holds water. In addition, the falsifiability of evolution has been satisfactorily addressed by numerous scientists and philosophers and it is indeed a ""theory"" in the classic sense. My disappointment isn't that his hypothesis is so unexpected (which can be great!) but that he provides no possible basis for its feasibility, which is a major bedrock of scientific theorization. Biophotons from DNA that somehow communicate agricultural information to people while they're under the influence of hallucinogens?? This is pseudoscience and provides no evidence to support that this is how biophotons work. (As an aside, biophotons appear to be released from the lipid membrane, which is the main area of cell-cell communication via visible light-- not DNA.) I think zaney unexpected ideas in science are fascinating and can lead to unexpected breakthroughs and major paradigm shifts. But they need to have some REASONABLE physical basis. In such instances, the burden of proof will always be on the hypothesizer. And, as somebody coming from within the field, I felt like his arguments were extremely weak and reflective of his poor knowledge of biology, which he himself admits to early in the book. In fact, he's guilty of the same ""cowboy science"" he criticizes. Anyways, still worth a read though. It's always a valuable reminder to pause, take a step back, and refocus."
7,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882877-nicolas-shump,5,"A brilliant and thought-provoking book that argues that perhaps the drug-induced trances of an Amazonian tribe and their creation myths are somehow related to modern genetics. Narby is a Stanford PhD in Anthropology who did his dissertation on these peoples, but this is not his dissertation. Instead it is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking books I have ever read! It brings together so many of the issues that interest me: Religion, Science, Evolution, Physics, Cosmology, the Supernatural, and Indigenous knowledge. I initially thought of the writings of Carlos Castaneda, but there is a scientific and intellectual rigor in Narby's book that I can not find in Castaneda's works.I find that Narby makes a compelling case for the unity or at least the synthesis of 20th century biology, DNA, and the indigenous knowledge and visions of these South American shamans.Reading Narby's experience of taking hallucinogens was eerie, but I could relate to some of his sensations. Your mind is never the same after these types of experiences. Though your more rational self may want to deny the reality of ""altered states"" of consciousness, the vividness of the experience won't allow you to deny them entirely or to dismiss the possibility of them either.I fond myself in constant agreement with Narby about the arrogance and consequent ignorance of Western ""science"" and knowledge. Finally, Narby's narrative is compulsively readable. It is a tremendously important book."
8,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2043801-laura,5,"This was a winner. Exactly the right balance between scholarship and accessibility. Almost half the book is made up of end notes and bibliography, and Dr. Narby is brave, cautious, and eloquent stating his thesis: that it is possible, and even likely, that DNA is sentient. Since he's a vetted scientist, this is no easy claim to make. Nor does he rely except but for a fraction of the book on his own experience with Ayahuasca, which is very limited, and one of the few things that I would have liked to see differently in the book. He comes by his thesis combining studies in a number of disciplines, from biochemistry to comparative mythology to his own field of anthropology, etc. I especially liked his criticism of the fact that scientist termed that part of DNA that we do not understand with the pejorative term ""junk DNA."" He said, ""This is cowboy science."" We shoot first, then ask questions. He would have liked to see that aspect of it termed ""mystery DNA"" as that would admit the truth of it: which is that scientists really do not understand how the brain works, nor certainly even less do they understand DNA. I loved how he talked about the 250,000 species of plants in the Western Amazon and how the fact that native Amazonians were able to put together the right three plants out of these 250,000 to create a substance now called in pharmacology curare. Scientists chalk this up to ""random"" luck, even though in the particular case of curare, not only is the combination of plants exactly the right kind to create a drug that will kill the prey, but not poison its meat, and also relax the muscles so that, say, if a money is shot it will wrap its tail around a tree branch and the hunter will have to climb the tree to get it. To make this drug one must cook it for a period of 72 hours exactly, and also not be anywhere near the boiling pot, as its fumes are extremely toxic and will kill if inhaled. But according to scientists, the fact that Amazonians have taught themselves how to do this is pure luck. Some luck! But examples of such random luck abound in the Amazon and the pharmaceutical industry, though quick to disparage its source, is also quick to capitalize on these drugs and their multiple uses in Western medicine.Too much to list here, but I annotated about half of it: there just was so much in it to make one think."
9,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5791673-laura,3,"While Narby's central ideas are intriguing, this felt very long-winded, and presented relatively few actual arguments as compared to the number of pages, and very few compelling arguments beyond 'well these things resemble each other'"
10,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/613426-maze-martinez,5,"This book was phenomenally excellent in its scope, pacing and informative research. Though the book is based on academic research, it reads like a mystery novel as it unfolds each new chapter with clarity and discovery. Narby's path begins in the jungles of South America where he learns from the shamans of the Ashaninca about Ayahuasca and the visions that have sustained their culture for thousands of years. He draws connections between their experiences with Ayahuasca and similar themes that appear in cultures all over the world. As the plot thickens, he hypothesizes that the shamans are perceiving reality at a sub-molecular level, and research carries him beyond his field into the realm of biology. He challenges the preconceived notions and ""blind spots"" in anthropology and biology that prevent Western academia from truly appreciating the magnitude of the shaman's visions. This book radically pushes boundaries set in our understanding of reality, and the materialism that stunts our growth as a society. Ultimately, The Cosmic Serpent is a book way ahead of its time, and is a plea to the ""civilized"" world to recognize the potential contribution that the Ayahuasqueros could bequeath to our culture. But we must preserve their ancient knowledge by protecting their way of life, and esteem them as colleagues at the table of academic discourse."
11,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,2,"Look, the first time I took a hallucinogen, I too saw all of the natural world break apart and twist together and reveal to me its interlinked workings, its fundamental connectedness to me and every other living and non-living entity in the universe entire, I too saw into the deeper reality of the unified cosmic consciousness, and I (alone?) learned that the funniest thing in all of creation is the taste of a 7-11 watermelon Slurpee.But did I write a breathless book about it and pretend that none of this had ever occurred to anyone else in the western world and that only I, on my personal magical mystery tour into the world of psychedelics, had discovered the ONE TRUE SECRET that would forever re-write the laws of science and place me alongside Copernicus, Newton and Einstein? No. I did not. I went to bed early, closed my eyes, and watched the pretty colors some more.Jeremey Narby took the other route, and so, following his ayahuasca fueled vision of two giant, fluorescent snakes, wrote a book every sentence of which is delivered as if by Pinto in Animal House, the first time he gets stoned, when with eyes wide he says, “So, our whole solar system could be like one tiny atom in the fingernail of some other giant being!” Gee willikers! Neat!The book starts off all right. Questioning the scientific method as the only means of gaining knowledge is certainly reasonable. His investigations into comparative mythology and the preponderance therein of snakes and twins across cultures is interesting, if not already rather well known. But the book just gets loopier after that.Narby bashes all scientists with absurd generalizations about how they hate mystery, etc., he trots out all kinds of nonsense about evolution, which he grasps not at all, and every one of his arguments is along the lines of, “Did you realize how complicated the human genome is? Let me throw a bunch of huge numbers at you! See? Wow is it ever big! And that’s supposed to have come about by chance? No way!”Here’s a paraphrase of how most chapters begin: “Now I’m not a biologist, so I don’t know anything about biology, but I read a book and talked to this friend, and oh my god! You won’t believe what I found! DNA is superintelligent and comes from outer space!” Anyway. He’s right that there is more to the universe than what we in the west think we know, and more ways than we know to know it. But he’s too timid to actually propose anything other than a mushy-headed load of vague crap about consciousness I can’t even summarize since he never directly says what it is. In short, it’s something about how life is so complicated, it must have been directed by some form of intelligence. Hm, now where have I heard that argument before?"
12,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15296799-jacob,1,"The concept and the first chapter hooked me, and then the downhill slide began. The style of writing bothered me more than anything else. Narby's insistence on conferring some kind of scientific framework onto his thinking is mind-numbingly dull. The same three thoughts trotted out again and again. Contains 40 pages worth of interesting things to say. I couldn't just abandon it, though, because the material seemed so promising--this idea that shamans, through the practice of drinking ayahuasca, are connecting to life's building blocks. Oh well."
13,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"Jeremy Narby was doing anthropology field work with a community in the Peruvian Amazon called the Quirishari in the mid-1980s. It was there he had his first experiences with a hallucinogen called ayahuasca. His experiences with the substance, and his talks with others in the community about their experiences, were a major source of many of the speculations found in the latter part of the book.From Narby's interviews he realized that there were coincidences in the experience of many of the users of the plant, that these further coincided with what he was taught about native medicine among Amazon people and his further study into DNA.Narby seems to realize as much as anyone that coincidences do not a medical revolution make, but he hopes his ideas inspire deeper scientific investigations.Among his observations:Those who drink the brew made from the ayahuasca experience several visual hallucinations that give them what they believe are deeper understandings of plants for medication found throughout the rainforest. They and users of other plant-based hallucinogens frequently have visions about serpents intertwined. Those he was studying believe that the serpent is the ultimate life principal. Narby also points to several coincidental religious icons featuring similar symbols, down to the medical caduceus which originated with the Greeks. Ayahuasca, by the way, also grows in a serpentine shape.The Quirishari believe that the plants they harvest often have symbolic shapes to help identify their uses, such as a plant used to counteract snake bites having fang-like structures on the leaves.DNA is very similar visually to the intertwined serpents. He wonders if this, in some way, is what is being represented in these mystical visions. He then goes on to list some of the more amazing facts about DNA. Each strand of DNA is made up of just four molecules in various regular combinations. A strand is only 10 atoms wide but the strands in a single cell would stretch out to about 3 meters (6 feet) in length. If you could glue these tiny strings end to end from all the cells in your body they would stretch 744 million miles (1.2 billion kilometers). Narby then extends this idea out further. Every cell and every living organism has DNA, and human cells have some of the same markers found in yeast, one of the oldest organisms. This means somewhere in the seas these four nucleobases were formed, linked together in a way that encoded information, found a way into cells, found a handy enzyme to split the coils into identical halves once in a while to reproduce, and gradually came to inhabit the earth with living descendants. This leads to other speculations on the source of DNA ... chance or an otherworldly hand? But beyond these speculations Narby hopes for deeper research into the hallucinogens at a chemical level as well as the interactions with other living beings, and also hopes that these speculations will also lead to greater advances in pharmacology and medicine.This is the kind of book almost designed to start arguments among scientists, and I'm sure those have happened over the past 18 years since the first publication. Many of the questions about DNA had already been asked, though not always answered. In some ways a new speculation in science gets an immediate dismissal from some but will sometimes gain a foothold for overall acceptance. Pangea made sense to every school child who'd studied a globe but took most of a century to become accepted science. It was a similar process when a Catholic priest first suggested the ""big bang"" as first cause of the universe.  In Narby's case Materialism may be the ultimate winner, but that doesn't keep it from getting a challenge now and then. When it is challenged it's fun to watch and ponder."
14,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71816122-y,5,"Great point about modern science: ""The rational approach tends to minimize what it does not understand ... (It) starts from the idea that everything is explainable. Mystery is, in some sense, the enemy. This means that it prefers pejorative and even wrong answers to admitting its own lack of understanding.  The molecular biology that considers that 97% of the DNA in our body is 'junk' reveals not only its degree of ignorance but the extent to which it is prepared to belittle the unknown ... This is cowboy science and it is not as objective as it claims. Neutrality or simple honesty would have consisted in saying, 'For the moment, we do not know.' It would have been just as easier to call it 'mystery' DNA, for instance.""Food for thought: ""How can nature not be conscious when our own consciousness is produced by nature?""Interesting metaphor: ""Ayahuasca is the television of the forest."""

Instead, what I discovered in reading The Cosmic Serpent totally caught me by surprise. The Cosmic Serpent is a powerful book synthesizing the spiritual, biological, and cosmic connections of the DNA through many civilizations, including Ancient Egypt, Australian, China, and the native societies of the Amazonia, to name a few. Using a narrative format, the book is also a story of Jeremy's own process of self-atonement. By the end of the book, the author finally sheds his (anthropologist) biases and fully accepts the native perspective on the nature of reality—a world where plants and animals speak with their human counterparts in altered states of reality induced by ayahuasca and shamanic practices.The Cosmic Serpent is a wonderful read! Besides the phenomenal discoveries, the book breaks with long-held anthropological traditions of living amongst the natives while retaining an 'observer' perspective, and lays a pathway for future anthropologists wishing to truly access the reality of native culture.Highly recommended!João MendesAuthor | Musician | HumanitarianCo-Author of SOUND—The Fabric of Soul, Consciousness, Reality, and the Cosmos"

21,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,3,"Cosmic Serpent ReviewThis is without doubt one of the weirdest books that I have ever read in my life. Here, I’ll give you a snippet so you understand what I’m talking about: Why do life-creating, knowledge-imparting snake appear in the visions, myths, and dreams of human beings around the world?. . . My answer is speculative. . . It is that the global network of DNA-based life emits ultra-weak radio waves, which are currently at the limits of measurement, but which we can nonetheless perceive in states of defocalization, such as hallucinations and dreams. As the aperiodic crystal of DNA is shaped like two entwined serpents, two ribbons, a twisted ladder, a cord, or a vine, we see in our trances serpents, ladders, cords, vines, trees, spirals, crystals, and so on. Because DNA is a master of transformation, we also see jaguars, caymans, bulls, or any other living being. But the favorite newscaster on DNA-TV seems unquestionably to be enormous, fluorescent serpents.This leads me to suspect that the cosmic serpent is narcissistic—or, at least, obsessed with its own reproduction, even in imagery.So that gives you a sense of the thesis of the work and the overall weirdness of the writing. If you like first-hand accounts of hallucinations in the S. American jungle (in accord with genuine shamanic practices of indigenous tribes) and a little structural criticism of anthropology along with a grand theory for where all life in the universe comes from: this is the book for you.And it’s not a dumb book, even though the claims are certainly outlandish. Jeremy Narby is obviously intelligent. And he does provide two important kinds of evidence for his thesis. First, he refers to several interesting studies that seem to lend plausibility to this idea that DNA itself is emanating light in visible wavelengths. Which is... weird. Second, he pulls together a truly impressive litany of research into the creation myths of indigenous peoples around the world.I’m not expert enough in either of those fields—microbiology / physics or comparative anthropology—to have any sense for whether or not experts would concede the claims that Narby makes. And for that reason, I’m skeptical (to put it mildly) of his claims.But I find the book interesting and—what’s more—I really, really think that there’s incredible potential for a really smart sci-fi thriller (book or movie) based on these ideas, kind of a Michael Crichton-esque version of Dan Brown’s Davinci Code.For that reason—if no other—I plan on getting a physical copy of the book at some point (I listened to the Audible version) and seeing if I can look up some of the cited research to do a little extra digging of my own."
22,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24064106-wesley-gerrard,4,"I eagerly anticipated this book as I had heard it mentioned as a classic on Ayahuasca and as a good reference point in a number of other books and Ayahuasca and shamanism. The author begins in typical Ayahuasca tourist fashion, and undertakes you on his Amazonian journey with a shaman, partaking in the sacred Yage ceremony. If anything I was a little disappointed with the author's own experiences and felt that he had perhaps misunderstood his visions a little. I read on, however, and the novel turned into a page-turning thriller. The research done on the twins / dual serpent cosmology myths was fantastic and a revelation to me. It was clear that Narby had done a great deal of research on his hypothesis. I think to anybody studying shamanism, the middle chapters of Narby's book are essential. As the book moved towards the DNA link with Ayahuasca I was at first sceptical but the author wrote in a convincing manner and I felt that the extremely distant link was well-pointed out and certainly a possibility though I can see the scientists more easily dismissing 'The Cosmic Serpent' than perhaps the ancient medicine men who I would imagine would be more open-minded. As an apprentice ayahuasquero myself, who has studied exclusively on my own in the West, I think that there is a lot more to the DNA link than meets the eye. Ayahuasca is a substance which does alter the mind in a tremendous way and I See true possibilities that it is what we call DNA triggering some of the visions. I think the book highlights, not how much we know of science, but how little we know of ancient shamanism. A true understanding of Ayahuasca and the power it harnesses, if well understood could drastically improve our world, if nothing less than to bind Western man back to his natural roots."
23,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339456-jamie,4,"Narby's experience as an anthropologist in the Amazon leads him to believe that ancient indigenous tribes in South America, Africa, and Australia have common themes in their shammanistic traditions, imagery, and mythology that mirror the work being done by microbiologists today. He looks for more similarities in science and ancient shammanism to create his own understanding of where we come from and why we are here.I found this book very inspiring from a creative perspective, and tore through it in about 3 days. Narby describes his descent into a rabbit-hole like a mystery novel or an adventure flick, so it's a very edible read. After finishing this book I wanted to create an entire series of childrens books rooted in a cosmology that borrows heavily from his theories.I found the premises of his research very refreshing: the notion of actually taking indigenous peoples at their word and interacting with them within their reality is very novel. Narby's work could be commended simply for his approach.As far as the content of his arguements...each reader mush judge for themselves. Narby's attitudes towards shammanism are heavily influenced/grounded by his need to remain viable in academia. My own experiences with shammanism were couched in a much more flexible environment, and I found the differences in our experiences and conclusions very compelling. "

This is no clearer displayed than by  reviews below or further afield online; that Jeremy Narby cannot speak on biology because he is not a specialist in it; Or, that Global South shamans can't possibly have discovered insights into the origins of human existence by way of powerful tools, such as mindfulness and biochemistry, because their process does not stem from Western rationalist thought and imposed abstract social concepts such as acceptablility. It's a great shame to me, that to this day, this book does not get the due credit that it deserves; it truly is an intellectual achievement - excellently written, with a humble tone - an honest investigation into the possibilities of DNA, hallucinogenic experimentation and consciousness. Furthermore, it pushes given Western rules, that underpin much of scientific research, to their historic, philosophical and scientific limits.Previous to a week ago, I'd be considered a stone cold materialist, mainly due to my Marxist inclinations; though they have began to soften overtime because of personal experiences, theoretical investigation and deconditioning from dogmatism (not just from crank-left political parties but also school, family, uni, the news media and the TV etc etc). I've experimented with hallucinogens since my late teens, natural or man made, with friends or family, at home or on the streets amongst you all. It's no exaggeration when I say that they've changed me and that I am a better person because of them. That they have contributed to the healing of trauma, that they destroyed my ego in one fell swoop and that I understand this world and myself more deeply after and because I took them. The authorities would say that I shouldn't take them because they cause problems for society, but believe you or me when I say that I would be a bigger problem for the authorities and society if I hadn't. Nearly 30 years ago, when this book was initially published and I was just born, the authorities, both of the state or in numerous fields, would scoff at the notion of treating mental illness with hallucinogens, decrying them as escoteric 60s hippie voodoo. But here we are now, with state funded programmes, empirically providing evidence of their value by scientific specialists across numerous disciplines; with US referenda on the legalisation of Psilocybin. Whilst many things might be solved beneath the microscope, across a whiteboard or amongst the books of a library, personal and practical experience can never and should never be underestimated. Rather than Jeremy Narby offering insights on biology, it is crazier to me that the scientific community - unquestionably made up of learned people who are valuable to us all - can entirely accept one untestable theoretical law (Darwinism for example) and not consider another that could be testable. It is a crazier notion to me that you analyse the use of hallucinogens on the brain or on us physiologically, but not try them for yourself to understand them and gather your research. Undoubtedly, this is in some part a symptom of prohibition, but it surely defies even western concepts of intelligence and knowledge gathering. Whilst I've never had a spiritual framework to view the world through, and maybe never will, after reading this book and reflecting on my own experiences of hallucinogens, (especially the natural and not man made one's), I have no choice but to accept some of the arguments and truths Narby outlines in this historic piece of work. This is based on personal and practical explorations, but after all, everything would just remain theory without practical application and experimentation. Narby, or the Shamans, do not categorically hold a key or a provide an answer to life's great questions, but they certainly could do and I think that everyone needs to approach this work with an open mind, and test their biases, as well as test the tools themselves. I've spent the last few days trying to disprove some of the scientific data in Narby's hypothesis with the power of Google and 30 years of scientific hindsight that we now have. His hypotheses stands the test of time and many of the potentials he ventured are maybe even closer to being proved, especially in regards to 'Junk' or now known as, 'dark matter' DNA or the the influence/interaction of DNA in and with consciousness and memory etc. Narby is an authority, because not only does he talk the talk, but he walks it. I take the authorities on the basis of a solid materialist analysis of their authority and not on their word alone. If you do that, you will recognise that this piece of work is a great human achievement and I look forward to investigating this fascinating subject, these fascinating cultures and watching this field and line of investigation develop for years to come. "
26,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88035649-michelle,2,"I am not a scientist, but I read many articles and books on naturalism, theology, and anthropology. When a colleague suggested this book, I thought it could be an interesting intersection between the 3.Narby starts the first chapters with an account of his time in the Amazon with native peoples and recounts his first time imbibing ayahuasca; a hallucinogenic compound seen as sacred to many tribes of the area. It turns out like you'd expect with Narby seeing fantastical hallucinations; of snakes in particular. It is very common to see snakes when taking any type of hallucinatory compound. I've read that in other books and Narby says it as well. What is also commonplace is when you come down from your high, you have a sense that you have a greater understanding of the universe, what you saw transcends words, a sensation that you are more connected to the cosmos, and a new inner peace. Narby is no exception. Right after his phycadellic jaunt, Narby submits to proportionality bias and a book that could have been an anthropological delight begins to read like he is an investigator in a H.P. Lovecraft novel; except you swap elder signs for DNA strands. His visions while under the influence were very impactful to him and he is frantic to find some concrete meaning for them in sober reality. The last 3/4ths of the book are spent in a cycle of him starting with an interesting fact, then piling on countless layers of conjecture, apophany, complex scientific theories reduced down to only the parts that suit his narrative, opinions, subjective data, and conspiracies.I almost shut the book for good when he introduced the theory of panspermia as a supporting one-liner and undisputed fact. At that point, I knew this book was going to be an unholy blend of transcendentalism and subjective drivel. The remainder of the reading was a slog and I got more amusement from watching him try to articulate that science is a failure while unsuccessfully using snippets of scientific facts to do so. Jeremy, I wish you would have stuck to anthropology. You had a good thing going at the beginning of the book. "
27,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79910413-kazik,4,"If even a third of Narby's various speculations are true then the world is so much stranger than I had ever thought. His claim that shamans have access to bio-molecular knowledge through the use of hallucinogenics and other shamanistic practices is fascinating and not as wide fetched once you understand how he got to that conclusion, which he spells out in the biographical nature of this book. Sadly, my own knowledge of molecular biology, shamanism, and anthropology are too limited to make any real conclusions about how plausible this is. Regardless, if you have any interest in psychedelics, epistemology, biology, or spirituality this is a thought provoking and relatively short read that will send you down plenty of rabbit holes. Now time to learn what the hell DNA bio-photon emission is and how it might connect to consciousness :)"

He proposes that even under the microscope, natural phenomena are mostly obscure, and that integrating tribal with conventional modes of study could be a gateway to a better understanding of things.I'd recommend this to those who have both:A.) An interest in science and anthropologyandB.) An open mindedness to some rather bizarre but fascinating ideas"
29,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65677816-fabian,3,"The book shows that there is much to learn from the people we call savages or primitive, it is very likely that they knew things about the nature that we in this modern world do not know. That being said the author does fall victim to the selection bias it seems, in that the only chooses paintings that look like the structure of DNA but disregards the much bigger number that don’t. One can find patterns in everything that way."

I had never heard of two of them, and I'm glad I read them. Very interesting theories, thoughtful and very well explained.

Trained as an anthropologist, Narby spends two years in Peruvian amazon observing shamanic rituals in particular use of hallucinogens (also experiments with them himself). After years of reflection and dipping into other areas such as molecular biology, he makes some interesting connections between these thousands of years old traditions and modern science. Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
37,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
38,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
39,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
40,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
41,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "

It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people.

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge.

He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

Trained as an anthropologist, Narby spends two years in Peruvian amazon observing shamanic rituals in particular use of hallucinogens (also experiments with them himself). After years of reflection and dipping into other areas such as molecular biology, he makes some interesting connections between these thousands of years old traditions and modern science. Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
67,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
68,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
69,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
70,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
71,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "

It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people.

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge.

96,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5317831-kerem,4,"Definitely a very out-of-the-box book! Trained as an anthropologist, Narby spends two years in Peruvian amazon observing shamanic rituals in particular use of hallucinogens (also experiments with them himself). After years of reflection and dipping into other areas such as molecular biology, he makes some interesting connections between these thousands of years old traditions and modern science. Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
97,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
98,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
99,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
100,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
101,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "
102,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24085447-mark,3,"There has been an increase in the amount of people wishing to become well read on psychonaut literature so they can talk like Terence McKenna. It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people. The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by Allegro is another oft-mentioned book that’s recommended to people wishing to be a well read historian on the matter. "

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge. I find his hypothesis intriguing and definitely merits further exploration."

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
127,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
128,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
129,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
130,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
131,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "

It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people. The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by Allegro is another oft-mentioned book that’s recommended to people wishing to be a well read historian on the matter. "

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge. I find his hypothesis intriguing and definitely merits further exploration."

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
159,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
160,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
161,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "
162,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24085447-mark,3,"There has been an increase in the amount of people wishing to become well read on psychonaut literature so they can talk like Terence McKenna. It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people. The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by Allegro is another oft-mentioned book that’s recommended to people wishing to be a well read historian on the matter. "

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge. I find his hypothesis intriguing and definitely merits further exploration."

174,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82541733-aaron-lyons,5,"Wow! This was really amazing. Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

Trained as an anthropologist, Narby spends two years in Peruvian amazon observing shamanic rituals in particular use of hallucinogens (also experiments with them himself). After years of reflection and dipping into other areas such as molecular biology, he makes some interesting connections between these thousands of years old traditions and modern science. Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
187,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."

One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"

Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."

The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
191,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "

It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people. The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by Allegro is another oft-mentioned book that’s recommended to people wishing to be a well read historian on the matter. "

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge.

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science).

217,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
218,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
219,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

After years of reflection and dipping into other areas such as molecular biology, he makes some interesting connections between these thousands of years old traditions and modern science. Even though his claims may be seen as unprovable at this point (and possibly wrong), he brings a fresh perspective, including a harsh criticism on the dogmatic and narrow perspective of today's science (such as too much compartmentalization and disconnect between different branches of science). His writing style is between personal and scientific, and surely an enjoyable book for those looking for something different!"
247,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
248,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
249,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
250,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."

277,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,4,"Interesting little book written by an anthropologist who challenged what I knew about DNA. Having read Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene and Matt Ridley’s Genome (among other books on genetic science) it is good to have a fresh new look at what DNA really is. Still, nobody knows how to interpret all of its code and how does it really work. Is it an antennae? Is it a program? Where does it come from? Why is it so large and complex? Why are there just a few differences in the code among species? Why 97% of the code is called “junk"" DNA and not mystery DNA?This book is written as an autobiography/diary and takes you from shamanistic ayahuasca sessions, then through most of the serpent myths across the world and finally to a new hypothesis of the origin of DNA and how we can have access to its information on a massive scale.I agree with Jeremy Narby’s position on science dogma and respect of faith and beliefs. At the end we see what we believe, and not just the contrary; and to change what we see, it is sometimes necessary to change what we believe. Unfortunately the scientific mind is overly rational and blinds us. But look and study the work of great minds like Einstein, Crick and Watson and Tesla, among others. The moment they think out of the box is the moment they get illumination. Don’t get me wrong, I like being scientific and being rational but I also love to challenge my own beliefs/dogmas and like to see both sides of the coin.Having shared time with shamans, I can say that they have a different understanding of nature and how everything works. They are guides who conduct the initiate to the spirits. The initiate picks up the information revealed by the spirits and does what he or she wants with it. This is a whole new reality and you are not the same after being around with them. They hold a lot of love and wisdom in their hands. Learn from them.We still have much to learn about DNA. The analogy to the serpent mythology presented in this book is of cosmic proportions. Prepare yourself to be challenged and try the tobacco and ayahuasca for yourself before emitting your opinion. Just like Narby says, all things considered, wisdom requires not only the investigation of many things, but contemplation of the mystery."
278,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496216-bob-mustin,4,"Despite being some 17 years removed from an engineering career, I still find myself caught up occasionally in the delightful mental snares of reason, science, and technology. One of the issues that keeps cropping up when I rhapsodize with reason is the enigma of DNA. We know all life is constructed from DNA, that it’s prolific, intelligent, and indestructible. But something in the pit of my stomach kept telling me that DNA is something else again, something so special as to be set apart from the creations it’s able to make of itself. One night surfing the subject on my iPhone turned up part of a paper on the subject by Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist. There was enough there to cause a text exchange between a friend and me, and the friend quickly presented the paper to me in book form. The Cosmic Serpent, etc.What has jarred Narby’s tree loose, as it had mine while reading this book, is the experience of Amazonian shamans who are able to - and here I skip ahead - actually perceive life down to the level of DNA. This experience allows them to select plants and processes that can heal, can discriminate between specific uses, with no trial and error experimentation. How? The so-called hallucinations these shamans experience talk to them, teach them things. Incredulous? Darby certainly thought so in the beginning.And so the book is a chronology of Narby’s attempts to piece together shamanic experiences with what science knows and is in the process of discovering about the sub-molecular world of life itself. I’m going quickly here, but Narby’s extrapolations are downright fascinating. In the end he was able to make connections between consciousness and DNA and the phenomenon of life. Is his story complete? No. Darby has his theories, which do border on the incredulous, but he’s able to make tentative connections between DNA and knowledge. Has he been able to define and identify consciousness? No. Has he been able to identify the true spark of life? Not yet. But this work has taken him tantalizingly close to all these ultimate answers.My rating: 16 of 20 stars"
279,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44218041-conor-sullivan,3,"In the 1960’s, anthropologists and other Western scholars rejected the possibility that the “savage” indigenous people they were studying could have acquired insightful biological knowledge any way other than by chance. However, due to the verifiability of their knowledge, the persistence of the shamans and the sheer improbability of their discoveries, anthropologists were forced to rethink this. Nonetheless, today they refuse to take the indigenous people at the word - that the plants told them what they know - or to consider that this knowledge might be of hallucinatory origin; to do so would contradict two axioms of rational Western scientific knowledge - that hallucinations are not ‘real’ (and, so, cannot confer empirical knowledge) and that plants cannot communicate like, or directly to, humans.Narby opines that the enigma surrounding communication between indigenous pharmacopoeia and indigenous peoples can be reduced to one question: was this information coming from inside the human brain or from the outside world of plants? Or, put more broadly, might there be a collective consciousness for everything within the biosphere? Thankfully, whilst pursuing this, Narby employs a narrative approach when writing - 'The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge' is half autobiographical account and half academic, and expository, citation - which helps to make the book more digestible. The book addresses a host of themes ranging from the scientific and anthropological to the philosophical, religious and (especially) the mythological.I am undecided whether this book documents the descent of a rational man into irrationality, because of his affinity with the indigenous people he lived with for two years and his desire not to be another Western academic imposing himself on their way of life, or one of the few truly rational approaches to scientific inquiry, one in which Narby consciously decides to begin with a tabula rasa and not presuppose any contemporary scientific theories. In truth, I am leaning towards the former but Narby does make some profound observations which I doubt would have been made using the traditional focalised scientific approach, which he criticises throughout.Those who have drunk the ceremonial, hallucinogenic plant medicines of these shamanic cultures ‘all’ purport to have an experience of being profoundly humbled. How can us rational scientific humans, with our anthropocentric presuppositions, possibly suppose to know the only way of reaching knowledge, especially when our own experience of reality is confined by things out of our control and comprehension? We are well aware that our perception of reality is shaped by our grasp of language and how well we can understand abstract concepts, so could the fact we define hallucinations as ‘delusions’, within our own linguistic culture, limit our understanding of reality?The book is a fierce critique of the modern structuralist and post-structuralist anthropological methods, and of Darwinian biology. Narby, an anthropologist himself, prefers not to think of anthropology as a science but as a means of interpreting foreign cultures; cultural ‘aliens’ (that is, anthropologists) can never fully understand a foreign culture. Narby closes out the book presenting contradictions that exist within the Darwinian gradualist natural selection paradigm: he criticises its inability to be falsifiable and, thereby, truly scientific. He also questions Crick’s “central dogma” - that chance, by way of error and mutation, is responsible for novelty - which arose with the development of molecular biology and has turned biology, at large, into an increasingly materialist philosophy. Instead, he hints at the possibility of an intelligent teleology driving evolution. Although I agree that the ‘objective gaze’ of anthropologists’ has historically failed to “objectify its objectifying relationship” and, in so doing, ‘perpetuated a colonial discourse and the notion of cultural domination, by way of description’ (shamanism was initially dismissed as mental derangement), I feel Narby ultimately ends up aggrandising the improbable. Notwithstanding, the critiques he does posit are very interesting and at times surprisingly convincing, as are the issues the book addresses outside of anthropology and biology - those of more general rights, e.g. the question of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people.Narby does seem to guide our hand in his overemphasis of his own ‘revelations’. To bolster his claims, he often talks about the significance of different indigenous tribes - e.g. the Taulipang, who live in Guyana, & the Ashaninca, in Peru - having the same mythological motifs despite their geographical distance (in this example, some 3000 miles). Is he simply ignorant of the fact that seemingly disparate cultures are often derived from a single earlier culture of a migratory population (e.g. the Indo-Europeans, from who’s myth vestiges can be found from Ireland to India - a distance of around 8000 miles), or is he projecting a meaning on to common mythological metaphor by detaching them from their wider historical context? Narby touches on the latter as being a potential criticism but I don’t think he ever convincingly manages to address it.Personally, I believe that Narby holds a certain disdain for the Western world in its current state. The parallels he draws between global mythologies and their original inclusion of a twin serpent-like creator God - although very interesting - suggests, to me, that he considers Western mythology inferior to the mythologies of shamanic culture, as he tacitly asserts our mythology has been corrupted by a patriarchal usurpation of the androgynous transformative central figure which his hypothesis centres around, without considering it as simply an evolution of our own culture. Again, this is shown when Narby states (in one of his final citations) that James Watson’s conception of the structure of DNA was based on ‘an X-Ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin, whose work was thus central to Watson and Crick’s discovery, but who received no mention when the Nobel Prize was awarded. That she was a woman, and that things should have occurred in this way, was surely no coincidence.’ In reality, Rosalind Franklin died in 1958 whilst Crick and Watson, alongside Maurice Wilkins, who was Franklin’s laboratory colleague, won the Nobel Prize in 1962. Given that Nobel Prize’s are not awarded posthumously, I think it is clear that had Franklin been alive she, too, would have won.All things considered, I find little credence in the hypothesis Narby puts forward in this book but I can say this was a very entertaining and stimulating read, and is a book filled with intriguing theories based, albeit loosely, on serious scientific literature."
280,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47126025-stefan-iulian-tesoi,3,"The book has a promising start but it goes downhill from there. The author is quite brave to make some gutsy and creative claims but in my humble opinion he committed two cognitive fallacies in the elaboration of his theory: confirmation bias and pareidolia. Humans have a tendency to see what they want to see, to hear what they want to hear and to believe what they want to believe and the author is no different. After spending some time with the Indians of Peru as an anthropologist he goes back home where he starts writing about his experience. One day he happens to find a book about biology and in that book he discovers the double helix of the DNA and he has a revelation: the double helix is very similar with the twin serpent - the cosmic serpent - that appears recurrently in various cultures spread around South America and not only. From that point he starts searching for more similarities and he obviously finds them - that's the bias confirmation in action, he starts seeing serpents and DNA double helixes everywhere - that's the pareidolia in action.The following quote can sum up the authors' theory, he basically claims that shamans can access the DNA information of plants and that the shamans know about the DNA double helix and other biomolecuar concepts (like the chromosome) but without them knowing it (if that makes sense): ""ACCORDING TO MY HYPOTHESIS, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to biomolecular information. But what actually goes on in the brain/mind of an ayahuasquero when this occurs? What is the nature of a shaman’s communication with the animate essences of nature? The clear answer is that more research is needed in consciousness, shamanism, molecular biology, and their interrelatedness."" "
281,0874779642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5753401-henrique-maia,4,"This is the kind of book that can be an eye-opener. Maybe one can find in it more juice if one has already some inkling about psychedelic experiences and studies, or if you have had some experience with hallucinatory substances, especially ayahuasca, which is central to the thesis of the book.At times Narby seems to get too carried away with his part of the argument, but that also makes this book a very humane one, as it carries us through a simplified stream of consciousness as an idea evolves throughout the author's investigative effort. In the end, what one takes from it depends on how open-minded one might be to face the world around us under different conceptual assumptions than those we (westerners, particularly) are mostly used. In any case, it's a good book to show how thinking outside-the-box can be achieved and how defocalizing (using Narby's word) one's attention while trying to solve a problem can lead to very interesting results. If for nothing else, this book would already be worth a reading. "

It’s better to not say anything at all than admitting you haven’t read a certain book yet. As such, I thought I’d do a guide that lets you know who’s who and what’s what in the world of psychonautical literature. This is sometimes considered a standard text before you read anything such as Pihkal or Tihkal. I started off with Daniel Pinchbeck and Graham Hancock. However, readers who read Daniel Pinchbeck first might want to actually get a copy of the Cosmic Serpent. Daniel’s book 2012 goes into detail on the history of psychedelic literature, relating it to Mayan prophecies through their connection with mushroom use, and ayahuasca use by different rain forest tribes, while his previous book Breaking Open the Head is about his own initiations by the Bwiti people.

It is unfortunate that further studies haven't been conducted along the lines the author has explored in this book. The central thesis is essentially an Epistemological one. How do we as humans ""know"" something? And is there a more effective way to 'know' something. The last 500 years of Western thought have been built upon the philosophy of Empiricism and Objectivistism, with which humanity has made astonishing strides in technological advancements. Despite these achievements the author calls into question whether or not there is a more primitive and earlier approach used by humanity to acquire knowledge.

Filled in many missing gaps.""Shamans speak in twisted language because they want to carefully examine things-twisted language brings me close but not too close-with normal words I would crash into things-with twisted ones I circle around them-I can see them clearly.""This really reminds me of how Carl Jung writes ...All Shamanic relations with the spirits are ""deliberately constructed in an elliptical and multi-referential fashion so as to mirror the refractory nature of the beings who are their objects.' He concludes: ""Yoshi are real beings who are both 'like and not like' the things they animate. They have no stable or unitary nature and thus, paradoxically, the 'seeing as' of 'twisted language' is the only way of adequately describing them. Metaphor here is not improper naming but the only proper naming possible.""""Wherever nature is revered as self-moving, and so inherently divine, the serpent is revered as symbolic of its divine life""This reminds me of the thing I saw in a vision. Some sort of strange machinery that was self-perpetuating and clearly alive, somewhere inside me, inside my mind perhaps. It was growing in and out of itself like a snake... The vision was very reminiscent of DMT visuals. This book draws the link between snake symbolism, DNA and a hallucinogenic brew that contains DMT which has been said to commonly show hallucinations of large snakes.""Your personal DNA is long enough to wrap around the earth 5 million times.""""97% of DNA's function is unknown""""The biological transition between bacteria and nucleated cells is so sudden it cannot effectively be explained by gradual changes over time.""The link drawn between the switching of the symbol of the serpent being the divine creator into being the villain, and the rise of materialise/reductionism, was fascinating to read also.""99.999% of all species that have ever existed are extinct.""""DNA emits ultra-weak radio waves/photons which exist in the narrow-band of visible light. The photons are emitted at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second. The photons are used to communicate between cells and organisms. This light is apparently 3-dimensional/holographic in nature. The general hypothesis of the author is that the hallucinogenic brew brings the shamans consciousness down to the molecular level where he is able to communicate with the snakes (DNA). His argument that the snakes seen are DNA is very compelling. The double helix of DNA looks like a winding staircase, a vine, or two snakes coiled around each other. He then goes to show that countless cultures across place and time have worshipped the 'twin serpent' who is the creator of all (DNA). Mercia Eliade discusses the symbol of the twin snake, but failed to draw a connectino to DNA. He noticed a common theme that he called axis mundi, or axis of the world. According to Eliade, the axis mundi gives access to the other world and to shamanic knowledge; there is a 'paradoxical passage', normally reserved for the dead, that shamans manage to use while living, and this passage is often guarded by a serpent or a dragon...""What if DNA stimulated by DMT, activates not only its emission of photons, but also its capacity to pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life""The connections he draws between the spirits in the visions and DNA is absolutely fascinating. Definitely going to be an essential pillar upon which much of my speculation regarding the nature of reality will be based from now on. This book has been so valuable to me and I believe will only be appreciated for what it is in years to come, due to the issues he challenges in the book.My reply to someone questioning why its being critized so harshly, copied here for future referencePeople are terrified of the unknown. The reason it is criticized is discussed in the very book. It is well known today that anthropologists are ridiculously close minded regarding new developments and new information that challenges their preconceived perceptions of the world. For many, the unknown is synonymous with chaos and fear, and they simply reject and repress its possibility. It took a while for us to accept the fact that the earth isn't flat, or that we aren't the centre of the universe. Time and gradual accumulation of evidence is necessary for any big shift in our thinking.Also, we were lost in superstition and such for a long time, believing in all sorts of scary things that weren't true, and doing unnecessary sacrifices. We took things literal and viewed the world through a mythological, symbolic lense. We went completely 180 now and are afraid of ever going back to the chaos. If you view reality as an iceberg, in an ocean, we've managed to scramble on top of the iceberg, on the tip, safe from the scary unknown below us, of the eery whales and dangerous sharks. We now pretend there is only the tip of the iceberg, distracting and busying ourselves by measuring the tip. Inevitably though, we will measure our way back into the underworld. This time we will have more coordination though. We'll be more sure-footed so to speak."
