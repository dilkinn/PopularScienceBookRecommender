0,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,4,"Nice introduction to the main elements of quantum mechanics. The part about the different interpretations of quantum mechanics is really interesting and masterfully accomplished; it should also be pointed out that this is one of the few very books on the subject that do not fall into the usual trap of only considering the Copenhagen interpretation. Being myself particularly attracted to the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, I found the treatment of this item by the author particularly interesting and balanced.This book does not provide any quantitative description/treatment of QM, so while it left me a bit dissatisfied for this reason, I must admit that it may be appealing to people interested in the conceptual apparatus of QM but unwilling to go through the required mathematics.I personally think that, in order to really understand QM, a minimum of mathematical depth is required, otherwise there is a significant risk of misunderstanding and over-simplification: as far as this particular book is concerned, while the author managed to explain some complex concepts in a admiringly simple and lucid manner, I have the impression that only with a prior more quantitative exposure to QM the reader would really be able to fully appreciate and understand the examples and arguments developed by the author. Overall, a very good read, recommended to people with some prior, even if not at practitioner level, exposure to QM. "
1,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13109840-john-jeffcoat-iii,5,"""Quantum Physics""... the term causes many people to either roll their eyes in an expression of pointlessness, or to just fall asleep for lack of seeing any applicable use, or to drift into apathy from an assumption that the subject is far beyond their ability to grasp. That is unfortunately because quantum physics is at its heart the study of the nature of reality, in a way that far transcends the esoteric realm of philosophy... but in a way that is not quite classic ""science"" either. What I love in particular about this book, is its many color illustrations that help (at least slightly) to visualize what is being discussed. Much like the popular ""For Dummies"" series of books... but in a far more visually appealing way... this book seeks to show the non-scientist masses just how fascinating, weird, disturbing, and to use an overused business phrase ""paradigm-shifting"" the discoveries of quantum physics really are. Your cell phone, your computer, and the GPS in your car... none of them would work at all without the principles of quantum physics. Quantum is a study of the unimaginable small. And when we look closely at such things... atoms and parts of atoms... we discover that the world around us may just be an illusion of sorts. Looking ""too closely"" at the fabric of matter exposes us to a world where effect can precede cause, information can travel faster-than-light, objects can absolutely be in in more than one place at the same time, and matter and energy blur into the same thing. Even more spooky and disturbing, we discover than when human beings look at an atom, the act of looking at it - being aware of its position or its velocity in our minds - actually changes its nature into being different than it was before we looked at it... because looking at it imparts an energy unto it.Remember back in high school when they taught us that electrons go around the nucleus of an atom like the moon goes around the earth? Wrong. And they knew it was wrong when they taught us that, decades ago... it's just that you cannot explain to most high school teenagers what electrons REALLY do, so they dumb it down to an analogy of one object circling another. What's really happening within every atom in the universe? Those electrons don't orbit the nucleus... they occupy quantum areas of probability of location around the nucleus... ""superpositions""... in more than one place at the same time. At least until we look at them using an electron microscope. Then, they suddenly ""collapse"" into being in one place, as if we caught them with their hands in the cookie jar. The implications of this are shocking. Forget about such trivial mind games as ""If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there, does it make a sound?"" The real question is ""If nobody is in the forest... is the forest still there... or does the forest only collapse from a potential state into a real state upon someone being there to experience it?"" To take this mind-twister out of the realm of science and drag it kicking and screaming into the realm of theology... ""We don't leave lights on in rooms we are not using... so why do we assume that God wastes vast amounts of energy maintaining physical reality in areas where and when nobody is looking?""Sure, it's easy to dismiss all this as ""silly talk""... until you take a moment to actually LOOK at what quantum physic experiments have been proving beyond any doubt in recent decades. Then, it's not so easy to dismiss the facts.If you've ever seen the movie, The Matrix... there is a scene where Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to take the red pill and be made aware of the true nature of reality... or if he wants to take the blue pill, and wake up in his bed at home, and continue in blissful ignorance. I encourage you to ""take the red pill"" and read this book."

I simultaneously realized how smart and creative theoretical physicists really are, and my little brain pales in comparison.I really couldn't rate this book in all fairness because I'm way too conflicted about it. The author had a wonderful voice, and the book is beautifully illustrated. I seriously give him five stars for effort. He really, really tried to make this stuff understandable. He used examples. He used pictures. He didn't use sophisticated language. Nonetheless, I just couldn't really understand a whole lot of it. I was doing pretty good in the first few chapters -- and only because I have taken a couple of years of calculus. But later on, I was just lost and also a bit bored because some of the concepts were just eluding me, and you needed those concepts to understand the latter part of the book.I did come away with incredible admiration for folks who actually do understand this stuff and can apply it to real world applications. Because it seriously is the most counterintuitive thing I've ever come across. A part of me would like to try another book on the subject to see I would come away any more enlightened.A part of me would like to remain blissfully ignorant.Another very strange thing about this book is that some of the concepts are so counter to reason that it really casts doubt in my mind on my own atheistic beliefs which are seriously derived from reason and rationale thought.Quantum physics really seems to highlight the limits of our understanding while simultaneously showing how brilliant we are. We can create predictive mathematical formulas that WORK under all sorts of experimental conditions. But we don't know why they work.Brain. hurts. bad.All in all, hats off to the author for even attempting to bring this subject down to layperson's terms even if he wasn't 100% successful with this particular layperson."
3,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,4,"after discussion of the double slit experiment, the author talks about the birth of quantum physics and who should be credited with what. interesting....Al-Khalili argues that the tradition wave-particle view being the main feature of quantum physics is limited (and has somewhat poisoned the water in picturing quantum physics)The author talks about the different schools of thoughts / interpretations of which none are perfect .He adheres to the shut up and calculate school of QP.Some feel. if two people have a differing opinions but no one way of settling them thorough empirical fact then their conflicting statements are meaningless and they should go and have a beer instead. Bohrs/Heisenberg/Pauli's Copenhagen interpretation is more of a set of rules to abide by so we can use it without having to make sense of the formal explanation. (Jim A's view)Also the C Interp. says nothing of how the process of wavefunction collapses occurs.An number of different guest spots from academics in this book, where they talk about their specialty and research. a nice touch."
4,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5539910-abdullah-diab,4,"A great book that introduces you to Quantum Physics, and as usual Jim's way is amazing, simple, clear and beautiful. You will not get bored with this book, not even if you haven't heard of Quantum, and on the other hand this book answers so many questions that you might have if you heard those stories about Quantum that make no sense (spoiler alert: they do make sense once you finish the book). The essays in the book are a good addition, they enriched the book and explained other ideas without letting the book branch into them and lose its goal. The only point that you need to notice is that this book was written in 2003, I can't imagine that this was 12 years ago, but it is, so some stuff that the book says we haven't reached or couldn't yet implement actually exist already, not necessarily in production, but at least in test labs, one example I sure know of is more than one implementation of the quantum computer. Also the book wouldn't mention the discovery of the Higgs boson and the breakthrough it made and its effects on the standard model of particle physics. But still all the ideas that are explained in this book are still valid so you really need to read it to get yourself aware of the amazing world we live in, and to prepare yourself for the future."

6,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22653174-firas-ghomraoui,5,"As an avid fan of physics since my adolescence, this book is impressive as a gate to the mysterious (and somewhat new) world of quantam physics. Throw all classical Newtonian physics aside and stare in awe and wonder as the author/theoretical physicist helps you find some solace in this intriguing world- after he stumps all logic and reason with the simple double-slit experiment, leaving you to ponder thoroughly as you decipher Schrödinger's equation for the ""wavefunction"", or look at the many aspects of determinism vs uncertainty. The book's simple popularizing theme coupled with the author's avoiding of chalkboard equations is what attracts a person such as myself- chest deep in medical terminology while throwing back at some good 'ole physics. This book is definitely ""for the perplexed""."
7,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,3,"I was fortunate enough to see Jim Al-Khalili speak about quantum mechanics a few months ago. The lecture hall was full to bursting, so I sat on the cold hard steps. An hour later I'd been treated to a fast-paced tour through fundamental physics and its possible applications to other sciences; and yet my head hurt less than my hind. I choose to interpret this as evidence that Jim Al-Khalili is an excellent speaker, able to get across complex ideas with clarity and enthusiasm. Or I might just have a delicate bottom. Either way, this is a nice book on quantum mechanics, albeit not the best starting point if you want to get into the subject."
8,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398216-pap-l-rinc,5,"Very professional, well written, with good humor: a no-nonsense, in-depth intro to the world of quantum weirdness."
9,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945208-kriegslok,5,"I used to be quite fascinated with UFOs, paranormal, conspiracy theories and such like. While Forteana still interests me the utter banality and fantasy (or nowadays unpleasantness) of the rest has lost its appeal. Fortunately I discovered the world of Quantum Physics which offers more empirical weirdness, tales of the unexplained and just downright outrageous improbability than a library full of UFO lore and conspiracy ever could. Things like this: ""Unless actively observed most physicists believe that the electron does not exist as a classical particle with a definite location, that all that exists is its wave function"". The best thing about it is that it's there to be explored and it's not dependent on some grainy photos or voice-overs of some shady character filmed in a darkened room. Jim Al-Khalili is my favourite theoretical physicist. Beside being very good at what he does he is also very good at explaining it in terms a CSE maths failure, such as myself, can understand (he is also very handsome and has a good sense of humour). It is a clever and humourous brain that explains wave probability through the movements of an unrepentant thief and his pursuers. Al-Khalili is not afraid to meet the issues raised head on ""You are not supposed to be comfortable with the conclusions of quantum mechanics"" and ""... I am just as baffled as the next person. My advantage over you is that I am convinced there is no simple answer or straightforward and intuitive explanation"". The book opens with some basics about what quantum is and is not. It introduces some of the key thinkers and discoverers. It explores the discussions and disagreements which have given the subject its foundation. It looks at the the theoretical predictions and their experimental proofs. Al-Khalili also manages to open the Pandora's box of particle physics and guide the reader slowly and carefully through the literal minutiae of particles and their peculiar behavior. One of the things I like about physics, even if I can't come close to claiming to understand is the symmetry and patterns which seem to make up the building blocks of nature. The book also gives a sense of the excitement in unraveling secrets of the Universe ""A surprising and still mysterious discovery is that the arrangement of energy levels in quantum chaology is related to one of the deepest problems in mathematics, involving patterns in the prime numbers"". It also examines the problem of interacting with the quantum world where "".. to learn something about a system we must measure it, but in so doing we often unavoidably change it and will therefore not know its true nature. This problem can be circumvented in the macroscopic world but not in the quantum domain"". I actually got to chapter eight before I started to feel I'd lost the thread (I have to add that I've read quite a few introductory books on quantum mechanics and if I hadn't would no doubt have struggled a lot more with this one) and had to recap (which helped a little). The book concludes with a look at the practical applications and benefits of quantum research and development (quite an eye opener) as well as looking to where future developments might lead. Quantum theory is a meeting point of science and philosophy, it is as exciting as it is confusing but it is also addictive. It is about the very stuff we, and everything else is composed of, how it behaves and why. I can't think of anything more exciting and urgent to want answers to. Not perhaps an easy read but one of the best I've read. As Jim says ""The quest for the ultimate truths is always a quest for beauty and simplicity""."
10,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,5,"An excellent book, although it is sold as an overview of ""quantum theory"", it goes over some relatively deeper concept examples I've not heard in other conceptual summaries of this subject, like the Zeillinger fake diamond detection scheme, which is a variant of the Eltzur-Vaidman bomb detection procedure, both of which could be thought of as a type of non-adversarial game, whereby there exists a ""best"" deterministic strategy guaranteeing success say 1/10 for detecting either the bomb or the non-fake diamond in the case of Zeillinger, that can be beaten by exploiting quantum properties like superposition or entanglement to increase success to 200% or of 3/10 for Zeillinger (might be off by a few percentages). Although, it's not clear that the quantum solution is that much better than what one could get from a purely non-quantum probability-based strategy, I think these quantum techniques are unique because they technically don't ""interact"" with the objects of concern to extract information, which if you think of it, is a profound statement. The author goes over the setup in nice detail, and should really open the reader's eyes to novel ways these phenomena could be leveraged in real life.Obvious from the above examples, the author's concerns in communicating the ideas of QM are mostly from an information theoretic and foundations purview vs. some unabridged literal overview of the subject. History is also kept at a minimum, the book is really about ideas.With the focus on the ""epistemology"" of QM, Al-Khalil helps clarify some issues that may plague those who are learning the material from purely the scientific/mathematical basis, by discussing what measurement really means (or could mean) in the context of quantum systems, as well as clarifies the true foundations of QM vs ""rules"", like Born's interpretation of the norm of a wave amplitude as the probability of some state, which helps to motivate the computational elements of the subject.The discussion here is really first rate, Al-Khalil has used his own voice to write clean, and to the point explanations of challenging material, that isn't just a verbal restatement of what one can find in a textbook. There is even a chapter on all of the current interpretations of the theory, as well as commentary on why professional physicist tend not to dwell on this facet of the subject (mostly cause diverging interpretations to tend not to alter the predictive power of the subject). The last 3 chapters deal with subatomic particles, application of QM in industry and other fields of academia, and the future of QM in the application and other fields.Highly recommended"
11,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,5,"“Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed” proved to be the best book I’ve read concerning the mysterious world of quantum mechanics. The author, Jim Al-Khalili, has an engaging style of presenting the technical aspects of theoretical physics. I found myself better able to understand quantum phenomena than I ever had been before. Of course, this does not remotely imply full understanding on my part – even the most expert physicists disagree about some aspects of how best to interpret quantum properties of molecular, atomic, and subatomic physics. I was quite intrigued by the discussions of particle interferometers on page 89. It seems almost as if a quantum particle has some sort of capacity for awareness of what properties the experimental apparatus has before the particle actually encounters the apparatus. That is, it would seem as if the particle had an awareness of what measurement was going to be performed on the particle BEFORE it encountered the measuring device. This seems to me to really beg for an explanation. I liked what the author had to say about Murray Gell-Mann’s positivist approach to quantum phenomena. Al-Khalili says the following (page 153): “I disagree. At least here I feel Einstein was right. He believed that the job of physical theories is to ‘approximate as closely as possible to the truth of physical reality’. So in true X-Files spirit, I would prefer to think that ‘the truth is out there’. Whether we will ever reach it or not I do not know but I am confident it will not turn out [to] be a futile search. Just because the formalism of quantum mechanics allows us the luxury of several interpretations that we cannot (yet) choose between does not imply that there isn’t a correct interpretation. Of course, we may never be able to find it, but it is too arrogant of us to claim that since we are unable to choose, then neither does nature.” As for myself, a complaint I had in trying to read the drawings (at the extreme top of page 185) was with the color-coded up and down quarks depicting the proton and neutron. Either the drawings for the proton and neutron at the extreme top of the page are wrong, or the color coding is confusing. It’s just a matter of a technical error in color coding, but it was confusing to me in trying to exactly understand the drawing. Overall, I found the book to be highly engaging and quite helpful in showing non-scientists like myself a whole lot about the extremely great mysteries underlying the quantum world. "
12,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733967-s-m,5,"Obviously there is almost no mathematics in this (it's a popular science book, of course). But if you're seriously studying quantum mechanics, and you don't have access to labs to do experiments with lasers and atoms, then this book will definitely help. It describes the experiments that set up the basic empirical facts about quantum mechanics, like blackbody radiation, photoelectric effects, light spectra etc. Not only that but it also paints the historical background and scientific reasoning of why these experiments are conducted in this way or that way, and what their implications are on classical mechanics.Towards the end of the book, Prof Jim Al-Khalili gives examples of how quantum mechanics can be applied to basically bring our current technology way beyond its current level. I'm not very interested in the applications, so I'm very glad that he didn't exaggerate the applications and that most of the book is about the theoretical grounding of quantum mechanics. Very useful as in my uni, the emphasis is on the mathematics (shut up and calculate approach), this book helps me understand why they are the way they are and how bizarrely weird the quantum world is outside mathematics."
13,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108107400-michelle,4,"A fabulous book. And totally over my head, alas.I read this one right after How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog, so this review is sort of a part 2.The strength of Orzel was his heroic attempts to provide concrete analogies to help us understand quantum mechanics in relation to, well, things we can relate to.The strength of Al-Khalili, on the other hand, was to make painfully clear that quantum mechanics only makes sense as math and can not be related to reality as we think we know it in any way. It just can't.So I gained a much deeper appreciation of the math, and of the utter weirdness. I think Al-Khalili provides a, well, much truer sense of what quantum mechanics is all about. Unfortunately, in consequence, I think I also quite lost my tenuous grip on everything I thought I grasped out of Orzel.With the Orzel, I truly tried to understand, and it felt like I could, if I just tried hard enough. I read and re-read sections, and he explained things repeatedly in different ways, and I studied the diagrams and usually felt like I almost, maybe, had it. With Al-Khalili, sigh. I stopped trying. I just read and let it wash through me and hoped some was absorbed. Re-reading the page six more times wasn't going to help me.But again, not the author's fault. The book was well written, and enjoyable to read, with the occasional delightful bit of snark. I highly recommend it - but only if you've done considerable homework first. "
14,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"This short book focuses clearly and succinctly on the confusions and difficulties of understanding the world created by quantum mechanics. With clarity beyond any other meditation on the topic I've encountered, the author quickly tackles and dissects what a strange world we live it at the very small scales.The author doesn't spend too much effort to come up with complicated metaphors as that would defeat the purpose of the book, to explain and elucidate. The author stresses ""this doesn't make intuitive sense nor should it"".Unlike other quantum mechanics texts, the author doesn't spend too much time rehashing the history of physics.All in all, this book is a wonderful introduction to the strangeness of the small. Other books have better dissections or better explains how quantum mechanics fits, but few will give you an appreciation for the field as well as this one."
15,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55205816-alecsphys,4,"This should be a book to be read not only by people wanting to have a glimpse of understanding about quantum physics, but also by physics students. Why? Because having an overall vision of the field, what was and what are the assumptions of the theory, its limitations, its interpretations, is so important that you can reasoning better and deeper without studying in a ""theological"" way. Most of the physicists fully understand the mathematics behinds quantum theory but they refuse to think on it, approaching the problems of the reality as just matter of doing computations. But there is something more and there are key experiments and key steps in the evolution of the theory that are well exposed by the author. Science and quantum theory are continuously evolving and I hope to read a similar book, updated, during my old ages."
16,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50208737-charles-victus,5,"This was a fascinating discussion covering both entry level, to mid level conceptual topics of quantum mechanics, and quantum physics. It was a great read because I feel it covered the basics pretty well, and then dove even further without any fluff. The more interesting part was the authors views on the implications of quantum research, and the potential (no pun intented) outcomes of those implications. For anyone looking to understand quantum theory, mechanics, and research just a bit further, and what it could mean on a bit of a higher level, I'd highly recommend this book."

18,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64847668-john-jessee,4,This is a good introduction for those of us that aren't fully versed in the intricacies of physics. I couldn't quite breeze through it due to the difficulty of the subject matter but the examples given and particularly the great design of the materials really helped me to feel like I walked away with a conversational grasp of the material. It's definitely one that I may pick up again in the future to help cement my understanding.

25,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Al-Khalili, Jim. Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed (2003)I'm still perplexedI love quantum mechanics. I just don't understand it. It is to me like embracing yes and no at the same time, like believing and not believing in the same instant, like being and not being as one. Yes, Virginia there is something beyond our understanding. And the wonderful thing about the postmodern world is that we know for a certainty (in as much as we can be certain about anything) that we really don't understand this world into which we have been thrown. QM proves it. As Al-Khalili points out again and again, even the top physicists turn away when certain questions are asked and let them pass because they have no answer.But I don't think it really matters what we think. The plain truth of the matter is that from our perspective as macro-creatures in a macro-world, with macro-minds and macro-mind modules molded by the evolutionary mechanism for a macro-world, quantum physics just doesn't make sense--or I should say, it makes good sense if we ignore the fact that the sense it makes is totally different in some very fundamental ways from the world in which we live.Einstein understandably abhorred the spooky action at a distance--the strange entanglement of particles which has no basis in our conception and no basis in any science prior to QM--and worse yet, no explanation. (We prove things we don't understand.) As Al-Khalili makes crystal clear no one knows how to account for the fact that no matter how far apart two entangled particles get, they seem to be in instantaneous ""communication"" with one another. Theoretically they could be on opposite sides of the universe. Well, the phrase ""opposite sides of the universe"" is meaningless, as is so much of our terminology when applied to the very, very large or the very, very small.And ""communication"" is the wrong word since instant communication would in effect be information moving in excess of the speed of light, which is still impossible. (I wouldn't bet the ranch on it staying that way, however.) Yet, what other word is there? No one knows! Measure the spin of one entangled particle and you can bet that ranch that the other particle will have the predicted spin. Hocus-pocus, abracadabra--or something like that.All of which tells me--all of what little I know about quantum mechanics--that the world is not as we think it is, and that down, down the dimensions to a very deep, deep ""place,"" way, way tinier than we can imagine, way, way tinier than the Planck limit, there is--well, by definition, zero, but by imagination possibly a wondrous world so far beyond our ken that it might as well be magic. Indeed, it is surely beyond our notions of magic whatever, however, wherever, whenever it is.Despite the wonderful color photos and drawings and fanciful artwork, and despite the detailed and even laborious explanations, I am afraid that Al-Khalili's book is not going to unperplex the perplexed. Frankly, QM cannot be understood; it can only be appreciated. And it can only be fully appreciated by those who understand the math. This book, in keeping with a long-standing book-biz tradition contains no math, or at least very little. Well, Schrodinger's equation appears on page 63, and is parsed, as it were, but not solved. It's really there more for decorative effect than anything else, as part of the artwork.But quantum mechanics can be used. The amazing thing is that applications based on our understanding of it are used everyday all over the world in lasers, computers, CDs, DVDs, rockets to the moon, etc. In other words, it's the same old story. We know enough to employ the ideas for our benefit, but not enough to come to a full understanding or a final theory. My guess is we never will. Scientific knowledge expands like a widening circle in a pond of water as we know more and more about the very large and the very small and the very distant in time and space; but the pond is unimaginably large, large beyond the limits of our senses and our instruments, possibly infinitely large. And so the circle expands and expands but never reaches the shore, possibly because there is no shore.Incidentally, of course neither the infinitely large nor the infinitely small are allowed in either cosmology or quantum mechanics. There is the Big Bang and no knowledge of what there was before the Big Bang, and of course there is nothing smaller than Planck and the ""logic"" of QM would allow.Or is there?The strength of this book is in the colorful and imaginative artwork and in the mini-essays from physicists such as Paul Davies, Chris Dewdney, Ron Johnson and others along with Al-Khalili's enthusiastic text. But if you think relativity was strange--well, comparing the strangeness of relativity to the strangeness of QM is like comparing the complexities of tick-tack-toe to those of three-dimensional chess.By the way, Al-Khalili assures us on the copyright page (alluding of course to the ""diabolical"" Erwin Schrodinger) that ""No cats were harmed in the making of this book."""

39,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6577606-douglas-koehne,5,"I'm not sure there is any easy way to learn about quantum physics, but Al-Khalili does his best to take some incredibly difficult ideas and present them to a reader in a way that can be understood. Understood - up to a point. Without a detailed knowledge of advanced (really advanced) mathematics or theoretical physics, some of this material is very difficult to grasp by even the most intelligent people.But the effort to learn is well worth the time and concentration. Ordinary physics can be very interesting and if a person digs into it enough can fill a person with awe. The universal forces of nature are incredibly enough - and that there are people who are creatively brilliant enough to search and discover and quantify these laws and forces is to me doubly amazing. Finding out there is an entirely different set of forces that make up the natural world, obeying a completely separate set of laws really pushes one to marvel at the simple complexity of how things work. Scientists and theorists who can tackle the uncertainty and craziness of how these quantum forces work to understand them and push for their applications in everyday use really have my admiration.The book has three basic parts: describing what quantum mechanics is and discussing the main features that make this field of study so unique; exploring the atom in more detail and the subatomic structure of the atom beyond the basic proton, electron, neutron components; and discussing and giving examples of the actual use of quantum mechanics in today's society (computers, lasers, medical scanning, etc.) and how research in the near future could revolutionize and improve how we live. I can't say I understood everything about any of these three topics - at best I'd like to say I felt good about up to 75% of what was discussed. Decoherence of quantum structures, subatomic interactions and differences of Fermions (Quarks and Leptons - matter carrying particles that make up the atomic nucleus and electrons) and Bosons (force carrying particles like photons dealing more with energy), and the search for a unifying theory combining quantum mechanics with Newtonian's laws (the world we see and experience) and general relativity (cosmic level forces). These areas the concepts makes sense to a point, but the in-depth understanding just didn't come to me.It is frustrating to me that what I learned in high school science in the 80's was mostly decades and in some cases a century old. It would be like US or World History classes not teaching anything past the 1920's. Why were we being taught the model of an atom that went out of accepted belief 75 years earlier? Sure, science is a difficult topic to teach, especially something like quantum mechanics that tries to fight against any intuitive reaction a person might have in trying to understand it. If current science isn't introduced to students, science that is changing the world as we know it with it's everyday applications, then it is easy to see why the US is slipping further and further behind in producing advanced professionals in science and mathematics compared to other countries across the world.The book certainly wasn't an easy undertaking, but I'm glad I read my way through it to the end. There is a beauty and wonderment to all of this, much of which is set in place because it is all so mysterious. But it works and it affects everyone's lives on a daily basis. And it gives us even more information on how and why the universe is what it is and can potentially lead us to know more about how the universe was created and why we have consciousness (that is a pretty big span of possibilities!). Undertake reading this at your own risk - but you'll be glad you did."
40,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108763688-jacky-weng,5,"Quite informative, qualitative explanations of quantum physics"
41,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12552823-sergiu-ciumac,4,"An easy to follow introduction in Quantum Mechanics. The author puts a great deal of effort in explaining how quantum mechanics was born, how it evolved to its modern state, and what are the consequences we may expect in the future. Enjoyable and thrilling at the same time."
42,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307982-luc-a,3,I thought this could use more maths.
43,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"I'd studied quantum mechanics at university nearly 50 years ago so I had a good idea what to expect in terms of the unexpected but Jim Al-Khalili made a better fist of explaining the subject than my chemistry lecturers had done all those years ago - and without delving into advanced maths. This is the third or fourth popular science book on quantum mechanics that I've read in recent months and it is by far the best. Jim has done an excellent job of explaining the principles of this complex field and approaches the subject in quite a light hearted way with little injections of humour here and there which make the subject matter feel less remote and the author more human. It is also reassuring that he states several times that no-one really understands what is going on at the quantum level, beyond, that is, what is mathematically calculated or experimentally observed, because it is so divorced from what we experience in the macro world, with most of it being counter-intuitive and bordering on the metaphysical. This repeated reassurance at least means that readers realise they are not alone in puzzling over the deeper significance of quantum physics.The last couple of chapters tried to cover too much ground, in my view, and consequently were less understandable than what had gone before. Many of the points discussed were extremely speculative. Also, when discussing some aspects of molecular biology, Jim seemed to draw a distinction between what he would call a ""quantum effect"" and what I would refer to as ""ordinary chemistry"". All of chemistry is underpinned by quantum mechanics so this distinction appears out of place.Some parts I couldn't follow, such as the descriptions of superstring theory and M-theory, but I suspect that this is because these topics do require a mathematical approach which is outside the scope of the book. Also, most of the chapters end with a short discourse by a guest author and I found these to be hit and miss, depending, I suppose, on how good each author is in explaining the subject matter to non-physicists. I'm not convinced these sequels added much to the book and it might have been better to have omitted them.But, overall, this is an excellent book, providing a first-rate, non-mathematical introduction to the quantum world."
44,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30313961-joey-sudmeier,4,"I really enjoyed this book on the first read through but am glad I purchased it (rather than borrowed). It's one that even with some (very limited) background knowledge of quantum physics I was still periodically trying to catch up with the concepts. Regardless, it's a good starting point and takes you from conception of the concept to where it could lead for us in practical use. I, personally, like the philosophical impacts of quantum physics which this book really doesn't address so I was left wanting a bit. "
45,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"I found this to be both more comprehensive and more accessible than any other book I've read on this subject. For the most part, it's neither inpenetrable nor dumbed down, but manages to strike just the right balance. Written in an informal style yet with great attention to detail, author Al-Khalili guides us through everything from the very beginning, taking care to answer exactly the kinds of question a beginner to the subject would have. He makes use of appropriate analogies, and dispels several myths propagated by other writers such as those concerning the collapse of the wavefunction, and Schrödinger's cat. The famously weird double slit experiment forms the backdrop to the first few chapters, and he ensures that we're thoroughly familiar with its weirdness before moving on to more advanced areas. He also delves into the differing interpretations of quantum theory (Copenhagen, de Broglie-Bohm, Many Worlds, etc) and isn't afraid to touch on philosophical questions such as whether a theory even needs an interpretation at all. Neither is he afraid to share his opinions, but does so with humility, in the context of presenting all points of view and acknowledging everyone's lack of certainty. Excellent presentation too - printed on high quality paper, with thought and care applied to the layout of each page, and charming full-colour diagrams and illustrations. Produced with such attention to detail, and with so much information, this book is a pleasure to own."
46,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34025877-solveig,5,"Excellent book on quantum mechanics, managing to be interesting, accurate, and entertaining, as well as conveying how mind-boggling quantum mechanics is."
47,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/737481-peter,5,"This is a very well written book delving into the fascinating topic of quantum mechanics. I already had some superficial knowledge from other books, but this really helped clarify a number of things and put the details I knew into a much clearer and wider context.The only negative I would say is that the flow is sometimes a little confusing. In places, there are rather long footnotes, captions, and even multiple secondary articles embedded in the main flow of text. These are a little difficult to navigate sometimes, but I found I got used to it eventually.Helpfully, the author suggests lots of avenues for further reading, and cites some sources (although it's by no means a literature survey). He also seems to do a good job of presenting multiple sides of the arguments on certain topics.It's worth noting that the book is rather old now so there has undoubtedly been lots of progress since it was written. It's still worth reading though, and I look forward to reading more by the same author."
48,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15225496-ravi-singh,4,"This is the closest people not into hardcore science would come to understanding a topic which is oft spoken but hardly understood. Infact it is challenging even for someone with an inclination towards science in parts, but the author makes it extremely readable and absorbing. To be fair some of the concepts just can't be grasped by ordinary people since they fly in the face of all we have grown up to believe. Which isn't too disheartening since it seems even the top scientists aren't in agreement over some issues still! The author takes you through a historical journey and ends with probably the best part of the book, the everyday real world application of Quantum Physics which are affecting our lives considerably.Recommended read for anyone who wants to delve a little more into the fascinating world of atoms and protons and quarks and bosons without getting completely lost."
49,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3242403-steve-malbasa,4,"A challenging read, no two ways about it, that is a good thing. One thing that is very good, though, is that it is about an area of study -- quantum physics -- that, by name alone, scares the hell out of people. But if your are willing to do a few mental gymnastics, you realize that even though the people who study this and teach it for a living are undeniably very intelligent, they don't know a lot more than they do. A lot of QP is the study of probability and establishing what they don't know as opposed to what they do. All they know for sure is that they are just as baffled as everyone else on particular topics. I'd really recommend giving this a shot. You may not grasp all of the topics, but Ph. Ds say the same thing about QP. Give it a shot."
50,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14625967-michael-moseley,4,"Jim Al-Khalili really helped me understand this difficult and perplexing topic. Quantum Mechanics is so counter intuitive and weird that we can imagine all sorts of strange realities. I have had to rethink some of my early learning experience and it is hard to drop the model of an atom like planets spinning around the sun but my new model of electron clouds has helped me in visualise some of the answers. I am still unclear about the state of Schrödinger's cat dead, alive or just asleep. There seems such an exciting future in some of the research what is yet possible with the rate of change we are going through. Worth a read for anyone with a science bent to help the understanding of Quantum Mechnics."
51,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1475334-john-burgess,3,"Sorry Jim, still perplexed. I'm a bear of very little brain when it comes to the world of quantum physics, but what I love about it is summed up by the mantra, ""shut up and calculate"". This basically means all the equations used in Quantum Mechanics work, so calculate and stop wasting time speculating about what it all means. We would all like answers to the big questions, of life, the universe and everything, but it seems there are limits to human knowledge and understanding which will leave us in perpetual ignorance. This is why fundamentalist versions of religions must be wrong. These claim absolute knowledge about the meaning of human existence, but are nothing more than seductive mirages in a desert of ignorance."
52,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1227689-marman,4,"I have been fascinated by quantum mechanics ever since I wrote a term paper about LASER some 21 years ago. The biggest hurdle really is the level of math that you need to learn to fully appreciate the concept. I never had the discipline to upgrade my math skills so I took the convenient route of finding and reading science books that deal with the subject with less technical approach. I thought I got the whole concept peg, then came this book and it just cleared up so many things for me.I think this would make a great first book for anyone who wanted to understand humanity's most bizarre scientific concept so far."
53,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4141235-ben,2,"If Al-Khalili spent less time waxing about how strange and weird and strange quantum mechanics is, and more time explaining it in a clear manner, perhaps it would seem less strange. He jumps around to different topics, and his chapters are interspersed with essays by other physicists, none of whom agreed on what exactly had been covered so far. All of this makes for a difficult time understanding---though it is easy to read.He does cover many interesting topics, including different interpretations (such as the de-Broglie Bohm, many worlds, and even brushes a little on less common ones such as the transactional interpretation), and applications to other fields."
54,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1346216-em,4,"This book did a great job of explaining quantum theory. Al-Khalili can definitely write for the layman; however, there were a lot of short articles written by other physicists that were not quite as clearly written for the novice.The illustrations in the book clearly delineated his explanations -- I think there was only one that I was scratching my head over. The first few chapters and the very last chapter were exceptionally good.I look forward to reading Al-Khalili's other book, Black Holes, Wormholes and Time Travel!"
55,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17984897-lucy,4,"I've read some other popular science books/articles on QM before this book, so I have a basic but shaky and rough grasp of the subject. I don't think this book managed to improve my understanding of QM that much but it's not the fault of the book, but rather, without studying QM in a mathematical way, it's impossible to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms involved. However, I particularly enjoyed and liked this book because it spends a fair amount of time on the history, applications and the future of QM. "
56,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130656-abbey,5,"I LOVED this book. Actually, I love quantum physics altogether, even though this is only the second book I've read about it. I thought it was really good, though. The author manages to write about some extremely complex theories in a way that a non-mathematician can (more-or-less) understand. It was fascinating, too, to learn about the different theories that try to explain why the quantum world is the way it is. There was also some great content on the potential future of quantum technology. All in all a fascinating, challenging and rewarding read."
57,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7533341-martin-moleski,4,"Very helpful introduction for the non-physicist. Lavish illustrations, which come at a cost of imposing an awkward form on the book and making it uncomfortably heavy. Good-humored. Not too many lapses into scientism or materialism. I should probably take a vow to re-read it every five years or so--and I should go work on my notes on the Standard Model while the distinction between fermions and bosons is still fresh. "
58,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21474536-scott-howarth,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read this immediately after Absolutely Small and found it extremely interesting, covering a brief history of Quantum Physics through to what to expect in the immediate future, albeit was originally published in 2003. Great job of explaining the fundamental theories and practices without the involvement of too much mathematics.Highly Recommended."
59,1841882380,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23755332-kent-say,3,Every 5 years I get the itch to read something like this. Didn't do much for someone who doesn't know much about physics. I enjoyed the more philosophical bend of Carroll's Big Picture massively more. I picked this up to see if it would add a bit more science to the description... it does... but not in a way that was helpful to me.
