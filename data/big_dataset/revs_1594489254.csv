0,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"WARNING: Do not read this review if you are squeamish. Or eating.This book is about cholera, and as a result, the author uses an impressive number of words for shit--including excrement, ordure, human waste, and the Victorian euphemism night soil. And shit, of course. Johnson explains that a key question in the development of civilization has always been ""What are we going to do with all this shit?"" This book dramatically improved my vocabulary regarding topics related to 1850s London. For instance:miasmatist: someone who believes that bad-smelling air rather than germs or bacteria cause disease (Florence Nightingale was a miasmatist)pure-finder: someone who finds dogshit and sells it to tanners to use in the leathermaking processstoshers: trash-pickersmudlarks: children who scavenge junk that toshers don't wantscavenger classes: pure-finders, toshers, mudlarks, and others in the recycling businessrice-water stool: don't askJohnson's previous books have been about how the mind works, so Ghost Map is really more about how people map information and adapt to innovations than it is a straightforward history of a particular epidemic. He writes that cholera is ""a supremely dark chapter in the book of death"" and points out how wrong it is that people are still dying of this preventable, treatable disease.I learned that this is not a good audiobook to listen to when cooking dinner. However, it is a great audiobook to listen to when cleaning. My kitchen and bathrooms have never been more thoroughly disinfected. "
1,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"By turns thought-provoking and irritating, The Ghost Map meanders from its central story -- how an unorthodox physician found the source of a cholera epidemic that swept through London in 1854 -- into a host of other issues. Expecting a more straightforward account of the unraveling of this medical mystery, I set this book aside twice in frustration, bored with the author's tendency to stretch out the narrative, and particularly his repeated examination of the hold the ""miasma paradigm"" had upon medical minds in the mid nineteenth century. He can't seem to get over the fact that all manner of educated and otherwise reasonable people believed that disease was caused by noxious smells. His lengthy discussion of the bureaucratic obstacles faced by John Snow, the physician who linked cholera with contamination of drinking water with sewage, begins to wear thin about half-way through the book. The Ghost Map certainly starts promisingly enough, with a description of Victorian London's hitherto unheralded ""recyclers"" - the ""night-soil men,"" ""mudlarks,"" rag-gatherers, bone-pickers and others who made a living scavenging in London's streets, rivers, and sewers. This is fascinating stuff -- who knew, for example, that such a person as a ""pure finder"" (dealer in dog shit, or ""pure, which was used by tanners) existed? In this Dickensian world, an astonishing diverse array of second- (or third-) class citizens eked out a living on the margins. From an examination of this nether world, Johnson then moves on to the slums of London, doing a crack-up job describing the cramped, horrid living conditions. He zeros in on one street and one family; a harried mother is caring for a sick infant, who eventually dies. The child suffers from virulent diarrhea and is wasting away. The mother washes the soiled diapers and tosses the dirty water in the cesspool just outside her door. The cesspool, in turn, oozes into a local well. The stage is set for the beginning of an epidemic. Johnson is best when he describes this world, with its reeking slums. But he is inclined, frequently, to hare after philosophical questions, not the least of which is mankind's inability to see beyond the dominant scientific paradigms of the time. This bogs the narrative down. While Johnson has many interesting ideas and speculations, it's tiring to be taken on so many unresolved side journeys. It's not quite so interesting, for example, to read (at length) of John Snow's battles with pig-headed authorities, who are blind to the obvious link that Snow establishes between one particular source of contaminated water and the cholera epidemic. Nor was I particularly enthralled to read the minutia of Snow's statistical analysis he built for his case. Johnson also seems inordinately fond of the idea of a ""map"" as a grand organizing theme, one which he stretches out well past the 19th century in the final chapter. Actually, the final chapter leaves Snow's London altogether and is something of an eye opener. Johnson discusses the role of cities in the modern world, as well as the gravest threats that mankind faces today. This chapter could well be a stand-alone essay. It made me think, ultimately, that this book would have made two excellent books -- one the tale of the cholera epidemic and the other of the social consequences of the rise of cities. As it is, putting them into one book, weaving between factual account and philosophical premise, was over-reaching a bit. "
2,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,3,"I read The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic--and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World because I wanted to learn more about a story I thought I knew. The story I learned goes like this: during a terrible cholera outbreak in Victorian London, Dr. John Snow made a revolutionary map of the mortality, was like, “Holy crap! The deaths all radiate out from this one pump!” and removed the pump handle, thus halting the epidemic dead in its tracks. Turns out, there are about seven books worth of topics in here, wrestling each other for space with brawny arms. Were all of them woven seamlessly together into one multifaceted, but logically coherent, narrative? Well no, actually, and I found myself in a constant whiplash between fascination and frustration throughout the book. Which left me with a lot to get off my chest, so if you want to move right along to the next review before the unloading begins, I totally understand.The Contenders1. What actually happened with Dr. Snow, the progress of the epidemic, the map and the pump handle = Fascinating. Enthrallingly, this turns out to be quite different than that story that was floating around my biology class. The way the structure follows the daily disease progress, the actions of Snow, and the previously underemphasized role played by local clergyman, Rev. Henry Whitehead -- all this was just great. If the whole book had been like this, plus a few more maps (see 5, below), I would have closed it a happy nerd, indeed.2.The history of a classic scientific paradigm shift from the miasma (bad air) theory of cholera transmission to the waterborne theory, championed by Snow = EXTRA Fascinating. Analysis of social forces working in science? Why yes, please! This cholera epidemic struck before widespread acceptance of germ theory, so most people thought that it (and other diseases) was caused by smelly miasma interacting with poor people’s conveniently innate weakness and inferiority and stuff. Several years before the Broad Street epidemic, John Snow developed an alternate, water-borne theory of cholera transmission, and evidence provided by this epidemic started tipping the scales in its favor. Johnson covers the Kuhnian paradigm shift from miasma to water: the circumstances that gave miasma such legs, how, in the grip of the miasma paradigm, some folks designed a massive study of this epidemic that could only uncover evidence to support that paradigm and missed what was actually going on by like ten miles (and you know we’re totally doing this today, but about what??), who changed their minds (most people, eventually), who didn’t (some diehard folks who didn’t have even a nodding acquaintance with falsifiability), and why. See: a classic. (Did you know that Florence Nightingale was a committed miasmatist? I didn’t!) I wouldn’t have minded a small acknowledgement that some diseases are truly airborne, so the miasma crowd was not as off-the-deep-end as herein presented, but that’s a teeny quibble. 3. Report on waste disposal in Victorian London, with particular attention given to poop = Fascinating. ‘Nuff said.4. Our modern understanding of the life history and evolution of the cholera bacterium = Frustrating, but maybe only to me. Host/pathogen evolution and interactions are like candy to me, because I’m weird like that, so I was quite looking forward to this bit. Well, the book and I got off on the wrong foot when he started with all that anthropomorphic language to describe the evolution of the cholera pathogen: the bacteria were “waiting patiently,” had “strategies” and “desires.” He did say, twice, that of course they’re not really hanging out and sentiently plotting our doom (for which, yay! Michael Pollan in Botany of Desire, please take note.), but then he kept right on using the misleading language. Dude! You’re a nonfiction writer! Taking complicated concepts and making them understandable is your job! Why would you tell us evolution is crucial to the story, tell us you’re explaining it wrong, then never actually explain natural selection exactly right? I didn’t get that at all.5. Snow’s maps as visual displays of quantitative information = EXTRA Frustrating. The guy put “Ghost Map” before the colon, for Lord’s sake and dragged Tufte in, the least he could do is show us all the maps he discusses. The only Snow map in my book was not even his revolutionary Voronoi diagram. Plus, I was dying to compare Snow’s maps with the less useful Department of Sewers disease map that preceded them. Yes, you can find all the maps in the John Snow online archive, but of the seven pages of maps in here, why are they mostly copies of the same map, seemingly included for decorative purposes? Why? Why?? 6. Treatise on historical urbanization and the emergent properties of city-as-organism = Fascinating for about half a page, quickly mutating into frustrating thereafter. Johnson has a clear parallel interest in these topics. Good on him: epidemiology and urbanization are intertwined in interesting ways. However, I feel like he could have dealt with it with a few swift paragraphs demonstrating the importance of urban conditions for disease emergence and why the scale of John Snow’s investigations mattered, and moved on already. 7. Rampant speculation about impact of the Broad Street epidemic on future urbanization patterns = FRUSTRATING. Now here’s where Johnson takes that parallel interest deep into crazy-train territory. The book closes with a 25-page epilogue of not-too-convincingly-supported hand-waving about suitcase bombs, bioterrorism, avian flu and urbanization that, even now, has my eyebrows in a pucker over what the heck so  much of it was doing in there. If he really wanted to put an original stamp on the book (which, after 25 pages of this jive, I’m pretty convinced he did), perhaps axing 99% of the epilogue and generating some new maps would have been a far more relevant way to go. How awesome would it be to see maps showing deaths over time, maps with different variables, maps of Snow’s data made using modern epidemiological techniques, maps of other London cholera epidemics, etc.? Very awesome indeed. In conclusion, more maps make everything better. Thank you. "
3,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"Cholera is a nasty little bug. Once ingested, it forms colonies on the intestinal wall, begins to reproduce with ferocious speed, and proceeds to trick the cells into excreting water rather than absorb it. It doesn't really matter of the host dies soon, because millions of new little cholera bacteria rush out of the host with the excreta waiting for the next person to ingest some excrement. That is the key. The only was to get cholera is by ingesting the excrement of another person so infected. Now you might say, whoa, that's more than I really wanted to know and I have no intention of so doing anyway. Well, you're right, all homo sapiens have a predisposition NOT to do just that, but given the rise of cities, the closeness with which we live, the relative ease of transportation, and the total misunderstanding of basic sanitation that existed until the 20th century, it was inevitable that the little buggers would escape their original habitat along the Ganges River.Johnson discusses the interrelationship of the rise of cities, alcohol tolerance as a genetic adaptation to increased agriculturalization. Drinking water could be quite hazardous, but drinking beer and other alcoholic drinks had survival value from a natural selection standpoint because the fermentation process and alcohol killed off many harmful bacteria. Since alcohol is a poison and ill-tolerated by many, the speculation is that as agriculture and cities began to predominate, those who could tolerate alcohol better than others survived to reproduction age.In another of those little actions that are intended to benefit, but which have unintended consequences, the change in use of sewers in London, inadvertently laid the groundwork (pun intended) for the cholera epidemic. Sewers had been designed to channel away rain water to and help prevent flooding in the city. In fact, it was prohibited to dump anything in the sewers and the Thames had been teeming with fish and quite clean. As the population increased, waste accumulated, and the aroma of piles of excrement in basements and elsewhere gave the miasmatists (those who believed disease was transmitted in the air) food for thought (the puns just keep rolling along.) So they had the brilliant idea of using the sewer system to wash the excrement out of the city and into the river which soon became foul. As it had also been the source of drinking water, the transmission of the cholera bacteria was efficient and inevitable.Snow's rational approach to discovering the cause of the disease is remarkable in other ways. It had been common (a mythos that still is often heard today) to blame disease on lack of moral fiber. Since most of the victims were poor, and we all know that the poor are morally unfit, the victims themselves were somehow responsible for the illness. Snow rejected that possibility, rationally looking at evidence and building his case for the water-bourne nature of the disease. Johnson turns a nice metaphor in describing Snow's discovery: ""...how great breakthroughs usually happen in practice. It is rarely the isolated genius having a eureka moment alone in the lab. Nor is it merely a question of building on precedent, of standing on the shoulders of giants, in Newton's famous phrase.Great breakthroughs are closer to what happens in a flood plain, a dozen separate tributaries converge and the rising waters lift the genius high enough that he or she can see around the conceptual constructions of the age.""How the source of cholera epidemics in London in 1854 was identified and explained is the subject of this engrossing work. A very good companion book to read with this one is Yellow Fever, Black Goddess: The Coevolution of People and Plagues which has an excellent section on modern cholera treatments."
4,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,"3.5 Had seen the PBS special on Snow and his discovery during the cholera epidemic a few months back and this added more detail to that show. Interesting theories abounded, the miasma theory which was a theory almost all favored. How they did so much with so little. Took hard work without all our modern scientific equipment. Snow dedicated his life to the sciences, what he accomplished was nothing short of astonishing. Loved all the extraneous information, how tea helped with the lessening of certain diseases, why the flow of the Chicago River was reversed, and info on why these diseases flourished in the first place and of how with current conditions in some third world country, it will happen again.Quitman informative book, at times too much information, learned more than I wanted to know about how waste was handled in the past. The condition were nothing short of appalling. Didn't care for the last chapter but did hold my attention for most of the book."
5,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,3,"This is an account of the 1854 cholera epidemic in London and of the work of John Snow who through his scientific investigations managed to establish that cholera was waterborne and that the source of this outbreak was the Broad Street pump. This was going against the scientific opinion of the time a miasmic theory which argued that air, small and conditions were responsible. The book covers a variety of areas: history, biography, detective work, epidemiology and scientific investigation. Johnson uses a Victorian novelist’s trick and takes a chapter to introduce each player. The first chapter introduces the city of London and then the main players, John Snow, Rev Henry Whitehead, Edwin Chadwick and William Farr. The account of Snow’s investigations is fascinating. The descriptions of the conditions in London before the sewer system was built was pretty stomach churning. I never realised that most basements/cellars were used as cesspits. Also the descriptions of the myriad citizens who in varying ways made a living out of the waste has its own fascination. It’s a great story and I knew a bit about Snow, but I was less aware of the role of Whitehead. He was working as a vicar in the area and knew and visited many of those who died. He did a good deal of the detective work that supported Snow’s thinking. Snow, of course, was already known for his work on chloroform and anaesthesia and would have had a place in the history of medicine just for that. Johnson’s introduction to the book is a good summation: “This is a story with four protagonists: a deadly bacterium, a vast city, and two gifted but very different men. One dark week a hundred fifty years ago, in the midst of great terror and human suffering, their lives collided on London’s Broad Street, on the western edge of Soho.This book is an attempt to tell the story in a way that does justice to the multiple scales of existence that helped bring it about: from the invisible kingdom of microscopic bacteria, to the tragedy and courage and camaraderie of individual lives, to the cultural realm of ideas and ideologies, all the way up to the sprawling metropolis of London itself. It’s the story of a map that lies at the intersection of all those different vectors, a map created to help make sense of an experience that defied human understanding.”The book is somewhat repetitive at times: and then there is the epilogue, which leaves the subject of the book and is much more speculative. Johnson looks at increasing urbanization, arguing we are becoming a city planet and looking at what might put this at risk. He focuses on various types of terrorism, individual with weapons and explosives, portable nukes, chemical and biological. Here Johnson is in a more reflective mode, but it is very speculative and not really on the mark with too much painting terrorists as pantomime villains and not enough analysis. Skip the last chapter."

7,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/710529-lynne,3,"I enjoyed most of the book, but I hated the concluding chapter. I would have preferred it if he had stuck to his subject rather than stringing together a series of personal opinions. The discussion of the relative risks of a nuclear holocaust versus bio-terrorism via a genetically engineered virus seemed forced. Does it really matter? The author somehow managed to work in references to both the Iranian nuclear policy and intelligent design in a book about cholera in the nineteenth century. Was there an editor?"
8,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"This book tells the true story of the London cholera epidemic in the 1850s and how Dr. John Snow and Reverend Henry Whitehead eventually teamed up to solve the mystery of how the disease is transmitted. At the time, it was believed to be spread via “miasma” (bad air) and putrid smells. Snow believed in the water-born theory where vibrio cholerae bacteria is transmitted by drinking contaminated water. Dr. Snow mapped the progress of the disease, tracing cases and deaths, to find the source of the outbreak. His methods were scientific, but at the time, superstitions and prevailing theories were ingrained, and it was difficult to overcome the rigid thinking. In fact, one of the most enlightening aspects is observing how unproven speculations garner so much traction that evidence to the contrary is dismissed. I particularly liked Steven Johnson’s vivid portrayal of London. The smell of cesspools and overflows of human waste into cellars must have been atrocious, and it is easy to see how the miasma theory originated. The scavenging hierarchy is fascinating. A lengthy epilogue covers the future of urbanization and threats to it. The author advocates bringing advancements in infrastructure to developing countries to improve sanitation and provide clean drinking water. He also covers global pandemics (a particularly relevant topic, obviously), genomic advancements as applied to microbiology, and bioterrorism. This audio book sounds like a documentary and will appeal to people that want a deep dive into a single science-related topic. It is read by Alan Sklar. He narrates smoothly and his voice has a deep timbre, which works well for this subject matter."
9,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"Except for the feeling of nausea that accompanies the reading at times, this is a very interesting book about the cholera epidemic in 1854, before the existence of bacteriology/parasitology. It is also the epic tale of John Snow who almost single handedly kept track of contamination pathways, fought against the miasma theory and the biased and unscientific approach of his peers, tried to locate and define the germ and still kept his hat on like a gentleman. Amazing true story, especially if you are interested in history of medicine. John Snow is known as the father of Public Health and Germ theory, (in addition to his many contributions to medicine)."

11,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,4,"London was a cesspool in the 1854.....raw sewage ran into the Thames or was just thrown into pits in the back yards of tenement buildings. In that year, London had an outbreak of cholera which killed its victims in less than 24 hours. This extremely violent strain captured the attention of a physician, Dr. John Snow and a local curate, Rev. Whitehead...how were people catching this deadly disease? The common belief in the medical community was that of miasma...in other words an air borne disease arising from the horrible stench that hung over certain areas of London. Medicos thought that the poor who lived in wretched conditions were the center of the outbreak and bore the blame for this disease. Dr. Snow was not a believer in the miasma theory and felt that the disease may be waterborne. He and the Rev. Whitehead began a study which for the time, was very complete and fact based. They traced the infected water supply to one public pump where the majority of the people in the affected area drew their water. The pump was closed and the epidemic ended. The pioneer work of these two men was the beginning of epidemiology....the reporting and tracing of disease patterns and the government's responsibility to protect the population. Although Dr.Snow and Rev. Whitehead did not find a cure for cholera, they created the engine that drove the discovery of treatment. A very informative look at the biases and misinformation of the medical/scientific community in the Victorian age. Recommended."
12,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,2,"I finally got my copy of this, but I also got an ebook copy & see that it has some maps. They're OK, but I didn't really miss them. He describes things well enough that an audio book is fine. In fact, his descriptions of life at the time are fantastic. The setup is a bit long, but it has to be. It's hard to imagine people living in those conditions (drinking out of open sewers!) with so little understanding of disease. It's incredible how far our common knowledge has come.Well, in some cases, at any rate. I found the description of the newspaper ads & remedies incredibly sad because I see so many of them still promulgated today as pseudo-scientific cures. People are still buying supplements & using aroma therapy. A lot of this when I read ""Bad Science"" & it's just disheartening.I got the ebook because wanted to go back over his explanation of how cholera mutated. I didn't really care for it because of the way he framed it as a 'desire'. That was OK at first, but later on he said something about a group intelligence that came across as pseudo science. Here's that offending paragraph.It goes without saying that the bacteria are not in any way conscious of developing this strategy. The strategy evolves on its own, as the overall population balance of V. cholerae changes. In a low-transmission environment, lethal strains die out, and mild ones come to dominate the population. In high-transmission environments, the lethal strains quickly outnumber the mild ones. No single bacterium is aware of the cost-benefit analysis, but thanks to their amazing capacity for adaptation, they’re able to make the analysis as a group, each isolated life and death serving a kind of vote in a distributed microbial assembly. There is no consciousness in the lowly bacterium. But there is a kind of group intelligence nonetheless.He could have used some statistical analysis (SA) to far better effect. That's what this book is about after all, the birth & use of SA to solve large scale problems. SA shows us what is really happening overall & not just what seems to be happening from what we can see in any one spot. That's his overall point, but I don't recall where he ever comes out & says that specifically.Interestingly enough, the first epidemic council had just been formed a few years before this outbreak & that's what a lot of the book is about - figuring out how to analyze it. John Snow was the pioneer.At the halfway point & a bit beyond it's been pretty boring, often a rehash & bunch of detail on what has already been covered in as much depth as I wanted to know. Far too much repetition as the author goes back to tie in the preacher's (Whitehead) observations & the public health commissions. I understand that it is a problem to outline general trends & then go back into the specifics that caused them. Some repetition is inevitable. There are also multiple players, causes, & trends to follow, but he's covering the same ground & facts each time. It's getting very old.It was interesting the way he points out how the cure for the miasma theory wound up causing more problems based on ignorance, yet ultimately led to Snow being able to gather the necessary statistical data to narrow down the actual cause, still without knowledge of bacteria. That had been discovered, but was ignored by everyone. It also led to being able to solve the problem - eventually. The established theory prevailed far too long due to politics.I took a break at 5/7 & skimmed through it & 6/7. It's hard to skim in an audio book, but the repetition was awful, so I supplemented with the ebook. It did get interesting at the end of 6/7 & into 7/7 with more about current techniques for statistically looking at cities, including the 311 service. A long stretch considering the title, but he was trying to show that Snow & Whitehead's techniques are still being used. Unfortunately, he's covered the basics already several times.The epilogue is about doomsday scenarios in modern times from atomic bombs to 9/11 & the flu. I really dislike the way he discusses the latter. Again, he uses 'learn' as if viruses & bacteria could think. He also ignores the fact that deadly organisms are such a minority that they can actually be looked upon as poor mutations. It's not good to kill off your host, after all.He also seems to think that a city-planet is a desirable goal. WTF?!!! We are becoming more urbanized, though. He does tie this nicely in with the Broad Street epidemic & show some of the dangers we face from all sorts of mass effects biological & mechanical. He reaches pretty far & it's not his area of expertise.Overall, this would have been an excellent book if it had been about half as long. He tried to cover far too much territory & that led to a lot of repetition. It would probably have been better read as text where I could have skimmed more. As an audio book it was just painful toward the end."
13,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"When I was complaining about how bad Johnson’s The Invention of Air was I hadn’t realised that I had read and enjoyed his Mind Wide Open Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life. Then David and Eric told me to try this one – and they are right, this is a far better book. The things that annoyed me in The Invention of Air (the asides on paradigms and Hegalian dialectics for instance) are both in part rehearsed here, but in a way that assumes either that the reader has heard of these ideas before or if not then that the reader only needs to know enough about these ideas to further the story. I didn’t ever feel spoken down to while reading this.There is a necessity to the things that he tells us here (at least for the first three quarters or more of the book) that allows the story itself to build a momentum. In fact, the momentum of the story builds until it is difficult to put the book down. So that when he starts talking about the energy inputs that are necessary for a city to grow beyond 30,000 inhabitants toward one of millions, this is clearly information that has an important role to play in the story of London during the 1854 Soho cholera outbreak. These don’t feel like asides, they feel like important parts of the story itself.While this book is centrally concerned with the story of this cholera outbreak and of Snow and Whitehead figuring out that cholera is not caused by smelly air, but by infected water, this is really a book set at a tipping point. That tipping point is really concerned with the question of whether cities can grow beyond a few hundred thousand inhabitants and still be liveable. Where diseases like cholera could wipe out one tenth of a suburban area’s population in a couple of weeks that was still very much an open question.It would be hard to find a book that is better at presenting the relationship between facts and theories than this one is. There is a fascinating section of this book in which those looking for an explanation of why cholera struck Soho at this time had created a checklist of facts they needed to investigate – these included spotting all of the places in the area where bad smells could be found, creating endless tables of the temperature of the air and wind speed and direction over the period of the outbreak – that is, check all of the things that would generally go to confirm that cholera is an airborne disease. The blinkers our theories place on our eyes are so much easier to see in hindsight. Perhaps that is the only time we can see them at all.The last part of this book almost, but never quite, looses its way. The discussion on the increasing urbanisation of our species and the benefits and potential risks associated with this are interesting, but not as well linked to the rest of the story as I think they ought to have been. Sometimes it felt like he was struggling to make these connections. For instance, one of the major ways that it became clear that cholera was waterborne rather than airborne was by way of a map prepared by Snow: the Ghost Map of the title. And while the discussion on this map – particularly the fact that reducing the amount of information on the map made the map more informative – was fascinating, I thought the later reference to mapping the genome stretching this metaphor to breaking point.I don’t want to complain too much – as I do think that much of what is said at the end of the book is worthwhile, particularly around the threats of nuclear weapons, biological weapons and the possibility that we may be able to overcome the threats of biological hazards through our knowledge of DNA and predictive evolutionary biology. (And there is a nice aside on the dangers of Intelligent Design)However, this book is at its best when it is explaining how this outbreak happened and what cities needed to do to make sure such outbreaks never happened again. Learning that so few people thought to replace the water that patients were loosing, but rather seeking to ‘thin’ their blood by bleeding them – shows yet another way in which we blind ourselves with our theories. And this is perhaps the major theme of this book.As I’ve said, a fascinating book and one that is told in a way that would makes me wonder how the writer could possibly also have written The Invention of Air."
14,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1630617-moira-russell,3,"This review is so EXACTLY my take on this book I'm just going to link to it. The spine of the book, and the best part of it, is the long detailed explanation of what Snow and Whitehead did to trace (not stop!) the cholera epidemic, ending with that famous pump handle. I loved them -- they're seriously like little scientist versions of Holmes and Watson. The history-of-science parts discussing the evolutionary shift in ideas about contagion are also quite good. But the book falls down badly in some wild rhetorical thrashing about with regard to urban planning, city planets (or maybe it was planets of cities), biological terrorism, nuclear bombs (what), and how wonderful the internet is, and unfortunately most of that is the conclusion and epilogue to the book so that knocks off a star for me. Johnson can write fairly well, and certainly engage the reader with a riveting narrative, but his own attempts at Grand Theorizing (which he actually warns against, repeatedly, in his own book) are sadly misguided."

It then goes into the nitty gritty of where all those Londoners used to put their shit (basically a lot of them just piled it up in their cellars). I love this kind of thing -- looking at the forgotten underside of a period or place in history.Unfortunately, Johnson runs out of steam pretty fast. He repeats the same points over and over again about how crazy people were for believing that smells made one sick. He attempts to make it a story about two men -- a clergyman and a doctor -- who together solved the mystery of the cholera epidemic, but he really doesn't have enough to string together a legitimate narrative. And finally, the last two chapters is essentially his own ""master thesis"" on how the ghost map of the title was the forerunner of Google Maps and such. Pretty weak stuff. Would've been much better if he stuck to the history. "
16,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,5,"This is one of the best nonfiction books I've read in awhile. It's about a cholera epidemic in London in 1854, and the author does a great job of explaining the various factors that helped cause the outbreak, including a population explosion and the lack of a proper sewage system. The book follows Dr. John Snow, who was the first person to identify that cholera was spread by contaminated drinking water. I would recommend this book to history buffs, fans of epidemiology and also Anglophiles, because it brings Dickensian London to life."
17,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,5,"I think I can pretty say that this book by Steven Johnson isn't going to be for everybody. It tells the story of how several men tried to cope with and understand a massive outbreak of cholera in London during 1854. Yeah, riveting, right?Actually, it was. In addition to talking about the disease itself (which basically causes death by diarrhea), the book follows the quest of a London doctor named John Snow as he propels the nascent science of epidemiology into its own. Snow went door to door in what was largely considered a doomed neighborhood, gathering information about who died, what their habits were, and most importantly how they got their water. He was working on a theory (one that turned out to be quite solidly supported) that cholera was transmitted via drinking water, and one public water pump in particular: the now infamous Broad Street pump that was befouled because a cholera victim's septic tank was leaking into its water supply.This was a time before the germ theory of disease was widely known or accepted, so Snow was more of an underdog and outsider than you might think. The prevailing wisdom of the time was the ""miasma theory,"" which held that ""all smell is disease,"" and that cholera and other maladies were literally carried on the wind in the form of smells and bad air. It was amazing how hard Snow and the other main protagonist of the tale, Reverend Henry Whitehead, had to fight against this theory, which was largely taken as fact despite its frequent lack of evidence. But the team's tenacity and creativity won the day, resulting in the closure of the Broad Street pump, the avoidance of another cholera outbreak, and the iconic map of cholera deaths from which the book takes its name.In addition to this central story, Johnson talks about related subjects, such as the London underclasses, the sociology and civic engineering of large cities, and the new London sewer systems. (The latter were particularly interesting, since they were built as a means of cleaning up the filth of the city, but they basically just ended up flushing it all into the Thames river and making waterborne diseases like cholera worse.) About the only complaint I have about the book is that it goes off the edge towards the end in what is basically a thinly veiled plug for Johnson's Outside In project. But in general, the whole narrative proved to be both fascinating and educational. Plus I guess I just love this history of science when it's presented in a context and with interesting characters."
18,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"This is a thorough detailing of the 1854 London Broad Street Cholera epidemic. The beginning was a bit too authoritarian and preachy, but the rest of the book was 5 star. The day by day progression of Whitehead, and John Snow in their respective fields working to tract an epidemiology was, to me, enthralling. The miasma theory being so completely embedded within worldview, Victorian science and culture- plus the speed of the bacterium equaled a nearly impossible task in overcoming the London and European mindset. Even within door to door mapping and the removal of the Broad Street Pump handle by Saturday- it took far past Snow's lifetime to have full acceptance of the water source evidence. The sections of the book about evolution of microbes and human city living are 6 star. And homo sapiens' memory and brainstem systems tied so closely to aroma and disease warning were 6 star, as well. This often obscures (and has throughout human history) with scentless and sightless materials which cause severe and deadly human outcomes. Just from my own perspective, I have so often wondered that so many humans consistently embrace and exalt the glories and pleasures of urban density locations. This for both personal, work, and commute ""green"" reasons. When I cannot imagine living in such density when all waste has to be taken away and all food and drinking liquids shipped or piped in amidst so many other vectors. With 5 cities more than 20 million now, and at least 1/4th which are squatters- it is only a matter of time. Not just for bacteria crossing within human waste, but a mutated virus through an animal vector.At one time it was a prerequisite for Chicago kids and college age classes to have some trip or class requirement tour into the Chicago Sewage plants on Lake Michigan, the reversal of the Chicago River lecture, the west of Chicago proper ""poop ponds"" for fertilizer products etc. And some even went into Deep Tunnel project. That's still ongoing. Our hunter gatherer ancestors would pall, and so do I- a BIG prejudice, at living anywhere with 400 people per acre. London at that time was four times denser than Manhattan right now and with no skyscrapers- few buildings over 6 stories. Those poor people in those rooms dying in family groups. Johnson tries to give you some sense of what a small ""stomach ache"" pang might have done to your psyche at that time. I can't think of any situation in present day disease that leaves the mind so clear and the body so failing and horrific so quickly. It must have been emotional torture. Many dead in twelve hours, 100's more in 48.Not only does this clearly draw the evidence for this particular high mark in perception needed at this specific time in history for water borne pathogens, but the book also completely demonstrates how the ""truth"" if it is a ""whole piece"" world view is often just not. This has applied to nearly every economic, scientific and logical ""truth"" outside of the hard sciences at one time or another. Often what everyone in majority ""knows"" or medicine or science accepts as empirically correct, just isn't, or is barely a sliver OR completely false within other context or vectors. "

The most virulent single outbreak of the disease in the country's history also provided the opportunity to understand the disease and apply preventative measures... if only medical science weren't so convinced that disease were a combination of class prejudice and smell.This is the story of one man's struggle to push his theory forward, aided by a degree of local knowledge, one or two fortuitous circumstances, dogged determination and, at the last, the help of one of his detractors. The filth and desperation of early Victorian London is laid bare in graphic terms, as is the prevailing medical knowledge (and how close it was to the breakthrough it needed is near heartbreaking), and the ultimate victory, symbolised by the simple removal of a pump handle, provides all the vindication necessary - even though for one of the heroes of the story it's posthumous. The wonderful story of how one medical breakthrough changed the world to the one we live in today, and how medial science took to its feet and defeated one of the scourges of the nineteenth century.

22,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31553985-jess,5,"I just finished “The Ghost Map” by Steven Johnson this morning. It’s about the cholera epidemic that broke out in 1850 in London from the Broad St well. Although and very unfortunately so many people died from this occurrence, it significantly transformed London and science. I.e.: Germ theory as opposed to the miasma theory. The author also boldly claims that Big Ben is not London’s most magnificent marvel, but rather that which lies below the city – the London sewerage system. I found it to be a fascinating read from start to finish and it provides the eerie reminder that nuclear warfare should be far from our worries, especially when considering that an invisible monster actively lurks among us and for its best opportunity to attack. GERMS!"

24,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6341226-cinzia-dubois,3,"I gave this book three stars purely for the degree of useful information accumulated in this work about the transmission of cholera in the nineteenth century. Sadly, that's the limit of which my review is positive. For starts, Johnson isn't a great storyteller. The book is incredibly sterile and frequently unfocused. Johnson's narrative swerved manically between topics which he touched upon incredibly lightly, so lightly in fact that it was often confusing as to the relevancy of it. He was also worrisomely unfamiliar with science. I found it disconcerting that an author who is writing 'science history' claimed, quite boldly, that the Black Death was ""of course, transmitted via rats."" No, my good Sir, the Black Death (formally known as the Great Mortality) was not transmitted via rats, but rather via fleas, and the majority of transmission occurred between humans rather than between rodents and humans. However, despite his errors in a world where information is at his fingertips, he was heavily condescending to the intellectuals and academics of the nineteenth century for ascribing to the miasmic theories surrounding cholera. Johnson came across as someone ignorantly engulfed by his privilege. His narrative seemed to scoff at academics for believing that putrid smell could carry disease as if such a theory was as wildly idiotic as those who think 5G transmits COVID-19. Johnson seems to forget that the academics and intellects of the nineteenth century weren't privy to the scientific advancements as we are today, or that they lacked the access to well-researched, peer-reviewed academic journals and the internet in general. While this attitude may not have been Johnson's intent, his judgemental writing style (as opposed to a storytelling narrative) made it impossible for the reader to believe he thought otherwise. From the victims to the intellectuals, Johnson failed to display any genuine empathy for those affected by the outbreak in 1854, and this lack of heart left the book feeling lacklustre. "
25,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4117491-suzanne,4,"While the story of Dr. John Snow's efforts to trace the source of cholera in 1850's London was fascinating, what delighted me about this book was the way Johnson also pulled in perspectives on scientific progress, impromptu infrastructures, the evolution of metropolitan life, the limits of city size, and the sorts of ingenuity that amateurs can contribute toward solving really big problems. Like, who is pooping in the water supply? (There is a lot of poop in this book.)He also discusses the impact of confirmation bias and how it hindered Dr. Snow's progress. The miasma theory, which suggested cholera was spread through ""bad air,"" was prevalent at the time, and it was very difficult to change peoples' minds about it. When the data didn't quite match that transmission route, because caregivers didn't always get sick, the theory was simply adapted. Maybe some people were more susceptible to cholera due to lower moral character. Eeesh...But it is pretty amazing how he pieced it together in what became one of the first documented epidemiological studies. Highly recommended if you enjoy science history."
26,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,5,"In the The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World, Johnson has written a history with a number of check marks.Accessibility? CheckComplete Story? Check.Argument Well Presented? Check.Present New Insight? Check.Present Significance to Us/Contemporaries. Big Check.Primary Sources? Check. Johnson used committee reports generated in 1850s, various writings of Dr John Snow who realized the water coming from the Broad Street pump was the source of cholera-riddled water. Johnson also used a report prepared by Dr Snow's nemesis Mr Edwin Chadwick, a social reformer who insisted it was a miasma, a bad smell.What I would have liked to have seen: The Voronoi diagram that Dr Snow presented to the Cholera Inquiry Committee visually showing where Londoners of Soho got their water. People chose which local water pump to use based on how easy it was to get to, not on how close it was by map measurements. I had to look up it up online. The map on The cover of the edition I am reading is not a Voronoi diagram. The map shown throughout the book does not give the big picture while the image online does. Necessary Point: Steven Johnson is not a historian. He is a popular science writer. He has merged history and popular science to create a book that describes London's Cholera Outbreak in a medical-social context and tells his readers how Londoners now have a plumbing system that takes the waste products away. Other cities now and other cities may need a similar solution to a common problem in burgeoning cities. He also speaks of alternative solutions working in parts of the world, options to a plumbing system. Johnson makes clear that cities are great places for job, cultural development, social interactions and more, so the answer to burgeoning cities is not to disband. It is to cope with the problem.Worthwhile read."
27,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,3,"This turned into an interesting look at issues caused by the growth of cities. London, being one of the first big cities, was on the cusp of problems stemming from that growth and the accumulation of so many people in so little space. One of the problems: lack of a way of hygienically disposing of poop. It was everywhere in the days before sewers. The descriptions of Victorian London were appalling: poop in the backyard, in the cellars, in ditches, in cesspools right on the street. Not merely a turd or two but lying feet deep. The book continues by following the actions of Dr. Snow and Mr. Whitehead as they look for the cause of an outbreak of cholera and eventually trace it to a particular pump supplying drinking water to a neighbourhood. It’s an astounding piece of detective work when one considers the lack of scientific and hygienic knowledge. The author got a bit carried away with the concept of the belief of “miasma” (smelly air being poisonous and the culprit for causing all disease). It was well enough to let us know that such a belief existed and was seriously believed by many, to the detriment perhaps of science, but he kept hammering on and on about it. The book then goes on to explain the construction of the London sewers and the healthier conditions caused by their construction; including no more cholera outbreaks in London.All in all, an interesting book but a bit stretched out. Particularly the second half of the book seems filled with fillers and repetitions, which made the book not as strong as it could have been. Also, the final chapter seemed more of a thesis on ""the future of the city"". Not sure if it belongs here as it seems a completely different topic than a cholera outbreak in Victorian London.Note to self: when in London, have a beer in the John Snow pub on Broadwick Street, just steps from where the pump that started the epidemic was located.

29,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy,4,"I wouldn't have picked this one up if not for the Bookish reading challenge (for the ""epidemic task""...yes, we're crazy like that), and for the most part found it fascinating, especially the first half. At its best, this book is a sort of non-fiction history/science mystery thriller, following Doctor John Snow and the Reverend Whitehead as they try to piece together the complex origins behind London's 1854 Cholera outbreak, in which hundreds of people died in the span of a few weeks. The smells and...err...intimate practices of Victorians that Johnson describes here might dash some of the romance out of the era (imagine that instead of flushing ""nuisances"" away, you and your neighbors just slopped everything in your basement and let it sit there more or less permanently). Now imagine all your favorite Dickens and Londen-lodged Austen characters living like that because...well, now we know why all that is just skipped over in fiction, right? I suppose this is the place to add that this book is not for the easily nauseated.Another interesting angle of the story is the way much of the public and government officials reacted to Cholera--the medieval notion of sickness caused by bad smells and miasma was still firmly ensconced in the general consciousness--and it took some very creative evidence presentation for Dr. Snow and Rev. Whitehead not to be dismissed as total hacks. That illness could be waterborne was even harder for them to prove because the infected well in this case ""appeared"" to have the clearest, healthiest water in town.However, this book starts to repeat itself and its main ideas after a while, to the point where I suspected the author had run out of material and had to meet some sort of word-count quota. The final chapter, in particular, goes completely off the rails, bringing in completely off-the-wall analogies to nuclear and biological warfare and flailing, ham-fisted ""wtf?"" -invoking opinions. I was prepared to give this one 4 stars, if only it had stopped earlier."

I certainly hope there is something in the pipeline, since bacteria are becomingly increasingly antibiotic resistant. The part of the book that most interested me was the detailing of the personal stories around the Broad Street pump in Soho, the living conditions and the theories of spread of disease. Less interesting to me were the parliament/policies/Acts/governmental side of things (important though they are - and of great interest to the author, I think), and he did harp on about certain aspects, like the miasma principle of spread of disease (GIT diseases like cholera spread through the air via smell ie pestilential stench) and Dr John Snow's refutation of this - it just felt as if the author was going over the same ground again and again, having already made his point the first time.I had considered listening to this as an audiobook, but am glad I chose to read the actual words as I think it would have been easy to lose track of a narration at times - I certainly had to re-read some sections because I realised my mind had wandered!"

Forget any romanticism you may have about the Victorian London. It was absolutely disgusting as Steven Johnson makes horrifyingly clear in ""Ghost Map"". People dumped poop out their windows, stored it in their cellars, flushed it into sewers that ran straight to the Thames. London was a stinky, poopy place.The total free-for-all of sewage disposal led to several devastating outbreaks of cholera during the period. Due to the hard work of a doctor and a minister, one particular outbreak was traced to a particular pump from which people got their drinking water. This proved that cholera was transmitted through contaminated water, not through the air or by person-to-person contact. ""Ghost Map"" is a fascinating look at the scientific process at a time when science was hit or miss.The author does lose focus at the end and his epilogue makes very little sense.

Creates a lovely symmetry. This is basically the story of how sociology can save lives. It’s the story of a cholera outbreak in the Soho district of London in 1854, which killed 500 people in just one week, whose source was traced to the contamination of the Broad (now Broadwick) Street water pump (generally known to have unusually clean and good-tasting water, which made it popular) with cholera as a result of an infected infant’s diaper water being disposed of in a cesspool near the pump at 40 Broad Street. Dr. John Snow—no, not that Jon Snow (this John Snow was famous already for having discovered that proper dosage of ether prior to surgery hinges on controlling the temperature in the room, lest the patient receive too big or too little a dose) figured out that cholera was transmitted through water (the popular theory of the time was the miasmatic theory, which posited that cholera was transmitted through unclean air) and that this particular outbreak was transmitted through the Broad Street pump. Henry Whitehead, a clergyman in the neighborhood, initially resisted this idea, but after investigating further, was persuaded by Dr. Snow’s evidence, and succeeded in tracing the spread of the infection by speaking with the people of the neighborhood (to whom he had greater access, since they knew and trusted their priest). Together, these two men persuaded the local government to remove the handle of the pump, thus ending the cholera outbreak.They succeeded in solving the mystery in part because of a map. They plotted all the deaths on a map to show that the deaths were concentrated around the pump. I’ll reproduce it here:  Very well-written and a fascinating subject. It was also quite fun given that, actually being in London at the time, I could tour a cemetery where some victims of this cholera outbreak were buried, so that was a fun multisensory experience. There’s now a pub named for John Snow at this location, along with a replica pump at the original’s location, though unfortunately I wasn’t staying nearby and didn’t have the chance to see it. Next time! Conclusions: this book was phenomenal. Can’t overstate that. It’s far more than the story of the 1854 Broad St. cholera outbreak. It’s the story of London and its infrastucture and its growth, of the Industrial Revolution, of cities and civilization itself. From the macroscopic perspective to the microscopic, from the species to the personal, it’s a tour de force of a microhistory and a gripping read to boot. "
34,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"I love a good science story and this was a good one. Johnson sets the scene of the largest, most densely packed city in the world at the time:IT IS AUGUST 1854, AND LONDON IS A CITY or SCAVENGERS. Just the names alone read now like some kind of exotic zoological catalogue: bone-pickers, rag-gatherers, pure-finders, dredgermen, mud-larks, sewer-hunters, dustmen, night-soil men, bunters, toshers, shoremen. These were the London underclasses, at least a hundred thousand strong. So immense were their numbers that had the scavengers broken off and formed their own city, it would have been the fifth-largest in all of England. But the diversity and precision of their routines were more remarkable than their sheer number. Early risers strolling along the Thames would see the toshers wading through the muck of low tide, dressed almost comically in flowing velveteen coats, their oversized pockets filled with stray bits of copper recovered from the water’s edge. He will translate and explain this scene as the book goes on. We have big cities now without even wondering how the people manage to survive in them. This story shows a time when mass death was commonplace as a byproduct of living close together. Prof John Snow is the real hero but he needed another man, Henry Whitehead, a clergyman from the stricken neighborhood, who could help corroborate his theory. Just imagine such a large city…where does all the human waste go? Don’t read this if you are close to meal time:(view spoiler)[
  …this grotesque scene in an article published in the London Morning Chronicle in 1849 that surveyed the ground zero of that year’s cholera outbreak: “We then journeyed on to London-street. . . . In No. 1 of this street the cholera first appeared seventeen years ago, and spread up it with fearful virulence; but this year it appeared at the opposite end, and ran down it with like severity. As we passed along the reeking banks of the sewer, the sun shone upon a narrow slip of the water. In the bright light it appeared the colour of strong green tea, and positively looked as solid as black marble in the shadow-indeed, it was more like watery mud than muddy water; and yet we were assured this was the only water the wretched inhabitants had to drink. As we gazed in horror at it, we saw drains and sewers emptying their filthy contents into it; we saw a whole tier of doorless privies in the open road, common to men and women, built over it; we heard bucket after bucket of filth splash into it; and the limbs of the vagrant boys bathing in it seemed by pure force of contrast, white as Parian marble. And yet, as we stood doubting the fearful statement, we saw a little child, from one of the galleries opposite, lower a tin can with a rope to fill a large bucket that stood beside her. In each of the balconies that hung over the stream the self-same tub was to be seen in which the inhabitants put the mucky liquid to stand, so that they may, after it has rested for a day or two, skim the fluid from the solid particles of filth, pollution, and disease. As the little thing dangled her tin cup as gently as possible into the stream, a bucket of night soil was poured down from the next gallery. 
(hide spoiler)]The scientific consensus at the time was that disease was spread by bad air, miasma. The smell was horrible and people got sick; therefore the sickness was caused by the awful smell. That is what drove the great sewer projects. The local cesspools were abolished and waste was dumped into the Thames, moving the smelly stuff away. But if the disease is waterborne, then the authorities just did what any bioterrorist would love to do ….find an efficient way to deliver the payload…all that waste (and occasionally some pretty nasty pathogens) was going into the water supply. Yuk. The cholera outbreak was so bad, you could wake up healthy and be dead in 12 hours. Snow’s theory was that the cholera was water borne but he couldn’t decisively prove it. The book relates how he eventually proved that cholera was in the water and not in the air. But he wasn’t really recognized for the discovery until after he died (and many more died in subsequent cholera outbreaks). He was treated at the time like any scientist today would be shunned and denigrated if he/she questioned the religion of global climate change. Consensus is not a scientific principle but it is powerful. This is an excellent story of courage, tenacity, believing in yourself when everyone says you are wrong. 4 Starshttps://www.theguardian.com/news/data..."

I was really excited to read this book and it started out just as I imagined - through the dark streets and homes of Londoners falling victim to an invisible and deadly illness. He introduced some interesting descriptive accounts of mid-19th century London, with their ""bottle collectors"" of the time, but who actually collected and sold animal/human waste, pieces of fabric from corpses and other grisly items, this portion was incredibly interesting and kept my attention. It left me wanting more, literally...because that voice was quickly squashed by another one of Steven Johnsons voices. So, somewhere, I think it was around the time the narrative moved towards the accounts of the resistance to new scientific medicine theories, (germ theory) I started to feel like I was reading the same sentences over and over and over again, (which I do sometimes) but it was actually new sentences with the same words slightly re-arranged. There were pages of this. It seems at some point Steven Johnson couldn't stop himself from saying everything 10 times over again. Which actually was starting to feel offensive, because I understood pretty well the first time around, he gave great descriptions in making his points or claims - no need to repeat. The work of John Snow, the physician central to the narrative, (and his counterpart Henry Whitehead) is remarkable, not to mention profoundly important, and I am glad to have this knowledge under my belt. I would say the first 1/3 of the book, so full of very interestining facts, descriptive accounts of biology and history with supportive arguments in and around the story that was told with an almost medical and historical prose - that was lovely and completely worth reading. But in the last 2/3's I felt, at most times, I was reading the writings of a really intelligent drunakard telling a very intriguing story, but, alas, had one too many pints and completely strangled the listeners interest by repeating himself....repeatedly. Much like one of those converstations that start out grabbing your attention and then you suddenly realize you need to start plotting your escape. My escape was skipping part of the epiloge, when he started talking about ""the ghost map"" created by Snow, being the foundation for Google maps and, well, that's where I decided to just make a run for it (it wasn't soon enough). I'd say 5 stars for the beginning 2 stars for the larger portion...which was actually probably the smaller portion if he would have just said everything once."

It read more like an editorial piece, in many parts, than a history of Snow and Whitehead. However, it was a unique perspective. Johnson had a ""bird's eye view"" for much of his writing, a global perspective if you will, as opposed to simply being focused on the narrow lens of the impact of cholera in Soho. This book was written in 2006, and in his Epilogue he writes about the possibility of a pandemic caused by the avian flu. As the world currently fights through the pandemic of COVID - 19, there's a certain prescience in his words that's startlingly, gripping, and eerily haunting."
37,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"In 1854, a cholera epidemic hit London. The city had experienced great population growth, but did not have the infrastructure for clean water and sewage removal.At the time, the prevalent thought was that disease was spread by miasma (atmospheric bad air that smelled). So to get rid of the bad miasma, cesspools were drained into the Thames River, the source of the drinking water.Dr John Snow, who thought cholera was transmitted by water, painstakenly researched which water pump was used by the cholera victims. Rev Henry Whitehead aided him in finding the source of the cholera epidemic. Eventually, an extensive modern sewer system was built in London.The author also discussed public health concerns in developing countries with large cities. He wrote about the advantages of cities in terms of health care availability, culture, and lower energy use due to public transportation. However, a concentrated population is at a disadvantage if someone wants to wipe out many people with chemical or biological weapons, or a nuclear bomb. Epidemics or mutated viruses can also spread faster in areas of high population density.The book kept my interest except in the middle where it seemed to get bogged down a bit with detail. The descriptions of cholera which kills with acute diarrhea did not bother me due to a background in healthcare, but might bother some people. The author brought together a wealth of information from many fields--history, science, information management, and medicine, especially public health."
38,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,5,"My second reading of this, and, as I did in 2012, I enjoyed it very much! It may sound sort of gruesome, what with cholera and all -- okay, it is a little gruesome -- but Johnson's focus really isn't on the graphic details of death by cholera, but, rather, on what it took for the means of disease transmission to be discovered and prevented, on how scientific thought and cultural trends interact, on urban planning, etc. The horrific suffering is noted, and Johnson, in describing the progress of the disease, including the mental clarity victims retain as their bodies shut down, reminds readers more than once that whole families died together, wretchedly, in their rooms, but he doesn't dwell on these things beyond what is necessary to convey the urgency of stopping the epidemic and avoiding recurrences. The main characters, John Snow and Henry Whitehead, who individually and then together work to solve the mystery, are impressive and engaging. The promoters of the miasmic theory of transmission are given a fair presentation, and the process by which a new scientific model for understanding an ancient disease overcomes a long accepted theory is fascinating (spoiler: people, even clever science-y sorts, aren't always quick to recognize that they've been Wrong, even when the evidence against their beliefs is pretty solid). Johnson is a fine storyteller, and I found this captivating."
39,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"In 1854, a cholera outbreak struck the inhabitants of a London neighbourhood. Hundreds died, but two local investigators—a doctor, John Snow, and an Anglican priest, Henry Whitehead—joined forces to disprove the prevalent theory that cholera was spread through ""miasma"", or noxious smells. Steven Johnson writes well and evocatively, particularly in the early parts of the book where he's laying out the landscape (or I should say particularly the smellscape) of Victorian London, or the state of contemporary medical knowledge. However, there aren't really the sources for this to be a full-length book, it seems, and so as the book wears on Johnson increasingly resorts to tangents. The whole last chapter belongs to an entirely different work, with its speculation about the future of urban life, environmentalism, and... nuclear weapons? The core narrative about Snow, Whitehead, and the impact of the disease itself would make for a great magazine article, but as is, the reader is somewhat inclined to skim as the book wears on—and the dead of Broad Street deserve more than that. "
40,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,3,"Up until the end, this was a four star read. Then Johnson took the implications of John Snow's work way too far and it just didn't work for me. And given that, in this book, the last two chapters -- out of ten -- focused on that, it's hard to ignore. Other than that, it was an interesting book. I learned all about what cholera does to the body, and let me tell you that it was a bit much at times. I also learned about miasma theory of disease, which is fascinating to me. John Snow was way ahead of his time in many ways and was an impressive man. I mean, he did great work. And he was a man far ahead of his time. By the time his peers could appreciate him and his work, he was gone."

The story of John Snow (""HE KNOWS SOMETHING!"") and Henry Whitehead and the Soho Cholera outbreak was a fascinating of biology, epidemiology, sociology, memes, and epidemiology. I especially liked Johnson's discussion of how science and cities are not only interconnected, but essential to each other. In fact the entire book was great. If I keep finding good books like this to read this summer, I'm going to be a very happy reader."
42,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,4,"""This is a story with four protagonists: a deadly bacterium, a vast city, and two gifted but very different men. One dark week a hundred fifty years ago, in the midst of great terror and human suffering, their lives collided on London's Broad Street, on the western edge of Soho.""Our son, a writing major at university, recently heard author Steven Johnson speak about his books and on writing. He bought me Johnson's book ""The Ghost Map; The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic-- and How it Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World.""Johnson is like a Julia Child of non-fiction, blending history, science, and contemporary issues into an immensely enjoyable and fascinating narrative delicacy. Johnson presents a full background to the events of the 1854 cholera epidemic, covering sanitary conditions, the cholera bacterium and disease, medical theories on disease at the time, and the progression of the epidemic. The two heroes of the book are Dr. John Snow and the Rev. Henry Whitehead. Johnson explains how these men's contributions transformed medicine and science. Dr. Snow's pioneering research on ether and chloroform reached its zenith when he was called to Queen Victoria's bedside to ease the birth of her eight child. Dr. Snow doubted the prevalent medical theory of 'miasma' or odors causing disease. The epidemic in his neighborhood gave him the opportunity to carefully document and study the disease's progression, ending in the formulation the revolutionary theory that the disease was spread from human waste through water.The Rev. Henry Whitehead was the twenty-eight-year old assistant curate in the neighborhood church. He knew the community and the people intimately. Intellectual and affable, the curate saw first-hand the human tragedy of the epidemic. He noted that the households afflicted with the disease did not follow any known 'logical' pattern. The dirtiest (and most odoriferous) houses might be passed, while the house next door was stricken with death.Following these men's investigations is like reading a mystery novel; there is an impetus to keep reading to see how they solve the case. They end up meeting, and eventually, Whitehead was converted to Snow's theory.""The Ghost Map"" refers to Snow's map of the neighborhood that marked the dead at each house, implicating one central water pump as the source of the epidemic. Next to the pump was the house of the first cholera victim, with a broken cesspool wall that had leaked into the water supply. Snow's work did not immediately revolutionize medical theory. Changing paradigms of thinking require revolutions or a slow dying out of the old ways of thinking. The book concludes with a discussion on cities, their continued growth, and the challenges of post 9/11 problems.Our son also bought ""Everything Bad is Good for You,"" a Millennium Generation's apology for loving video games, television, and all the popular culture entertainment that is often attacked. In brief, entertainment has become more sophisticated over time, more challenging, and hence has expanded our mental abilities. For instance, he compares Classic television shows with their single linear plot line to today's multi-plot continuous story lines found in shows like LOST and MAD MEN. Young adults who grew up with computer or video games needed use more 'brainpower' than those of us who grew up with Candyland and Uno. Whereas contemporary popular culture is usually attacked for it's content, Johnson points out that the skills required are not 'bad for you.'"
43,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/907191-croaker,4,"On August 28, 1854, working-class Londoner Sarah Lewis emptied a bucket of waste water into the cesspool of her squalid apartment building and triggered the deadliest outbreak of cholera in the city's history. A Victorian city with more than 2 million people packed into a ten-mile circumference. This is the story of two men: Dr. John Snow who pioneered the use of ether as an anesthetic in the United Kingdom, and on a personal note, mentions the first medical use of ether by Dr. William Morton; and the Reverend Henry Whitehead, an Oxford-educated young man whose Anglican calling did nothing to abate his fondness for London taverns. The book begins with a description of London as a city of scavengers: bone-pickers, rag-gatherers, pure-finders, dredgermen, mud-larks, sewer-hunters, dustmen, night-soil men, bunters, toshers and shoremen. Against this backdrop of vile and ghastly smells, and in the face of a horrifying epidemic, Snow posited the then radical theory that cholera was spread through contaminated water rather than through miasma, or smells in the air. Against considerable resistance from the medical and bureaucratic establishment, Snow persisted and, with hard work and groundbreaking research, helped to bring about a fundamental change in our understanding of disease and its spread. Johnson weaves in overlapping ideas about the growth of civilization, the organization of cities, and evolution to thrilling effect. This is a multifaceted book incorporating a detective story, an introduction to statistics (math), and a personal history. The Ghost Map is a book that, like the work of Jared Diamond, presents both vivid history and a powerful and provocative explanation of what it means for the world we live in. Unlike Jared Diamond however, Steve Johnson does not load the facts to reach the objective that Diamond would have us believe. From Snow's discovery of patient zero to Johnson's compelling argument for and celebration of cities, this makes for an illuminating and satisfying read. It is not a book for the squeamish however; a vivid description of death from cholera is graphically and terrifyingly detailed. As interesting as the main body of the book is, Johnson ends with an Epilogue, which I believe was probably written well after he finished the telling of Dr. Snow’s story. If, for no other reason, read that chapter, but don’t expect to sleep well again. And when you read a newspaper article about a poultry worker dying in Thailand, think about what would happen if H5N1 were to undergo a single transgenic shift. Now, try to go back to sleep."
44,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane,4,"The Ghost Map is, in part, an account of a cholera epidemic that took place in London in 1854. I say in part, because the epidemic is really a springboard for a series of discussions. In a sense, this book is the history of an idea: that a disease could be waterborne.Back in 1854, this idea was startling, and unacceptable to most of the medical and administrative establishment. Johnson does a good job of highlighting the work of two men, John Snow (who did a lot of the thinking that led to the understanding of how the epidemic grew) and Henry Whitehead, who confronted the disease at street level, talking to the survivors and collecting much of the informal data that helped Snow test his theories.I found it very interesting to read about the struggle that Snow had with the proponents of the ""miasma theory,"" the prevailing wisdom of the time. Back then, people believed that diseases were spread by smells traveling through the air; I've read a lot of Dickens, so I'm well acquainted with the notion of pestilential or noxious air. The fact that this belief seems so ridiculous to us now is evidence of the inroads science has made into our lives.I had never really thought about the seismic shift that occurred when science began to understand nature at the microscopic level. And I had never given much thought to the correlation between clean water and the expansion of cities to the multi-million-headcount levels that are normal to us today. So on the whole, The Ghost Map was a pretty enlightening book. It's written in an easy to read style, and is a page-turner in its way.The book ends with an extensive consideration of urbanization and what it means to mankind. I'm not sure whether this enhances the central story, or detracts from it. It's interesting, in its way, but in the end it's only speculation--and speculation is endless. So the end of the book seemed, well, endless. I probably could have stopped reading at around page 217.Still, on the whole this was an interesting book, and I'm glad I finally read it."
45,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,4,"Book blurb: In a triumph of multidisciplinary thinking, Johnson illuminates the intertwined histories and interconnectedness of the spread of disease, contagion theory, the rise of cities, and the nature of scientific inquiry, offering both a riveting history and a powerful explanation of how it has shaped the world we live in. At 20.0% An interesting side effect of reading about cholera is that I'm constantly thirsty.At 40.0%: Unlike Jon Snow from GOT, this John Snow knows something!I listened to the audiobook which is wonderfully narrated by Alan Sklar.Oh the things we take for granted in this part of the world: clean water (well, maybe not in Flint), sewage pipes, epidemiology and the understanding of disease pathways. It's easy to forget that much of the world is not as lucky, and that not that long ago cholera outbreaks wiped out a significant percentage of the populations affected.I love narrative non-fiction books that combine science, medicine, history and still read like a thriller. Over the past several years I've become fascinated by contagious diseases, their origins, how they spread, how we reduce (or not) the mortality rates and this book is another piece of the mosaic. I was fascinated, educated, horrified, and filled with admiration for the two men, one of science and one of the cloth, who solved the puzzle of the cholera outbreak in London in 1854. Each and every one of us living in an urban area today owe a debt of gratitude to these two men.There are so many topics covered in this one book, and I really enjoyed reading about and pondering the implications of the sheer number of humans on the planet and what might be in store for us. The only reason I docked a star was because there was quite a bit of repetition and the epilogue contains the author's opinions on bio-terrorism and nuclear policies, both of which while important seemed completely out of context in this book. Better editing would have resolved these issues."

It's about smart people and triumph of modern (for 1854) science and medicine over people who believe in different kind of bull-shit (no pun intended). I liked it a lot, some pages will make you happy with your life here in 2019, just consider that life expectancy for kids was around 14 years, regular adult - around 23-24 and if you highly educated high society gentleman or lady - you better finish all your stuff around 45th birthday since you have less and less chances to see sun next morning. It's about cruel medical practices when surgeon takes 2-3 minutes to amputate you leg or hand. It's about families that lives so close together that density of population is like 10-20 times higher than modern Manhattan.I know I wouldn't want to live in such world (which was just merely 165 years ago). If you long for time of Victorian ladies and gentleman, drinking tea at 5 o'clock in rose garden - please do yourself a favor, read this book. It will tell you how great Victorian world was, that even Queen Victoria gave births to 7 kids without any anesthesia, only on 8th kid she got some ether from John Snow (main character of the book) to easy her birth pain. And who said you would be high society guy or gal? Read about people who make their living by gathering all kind of people waste, you may be born one of them if you lived there.Great book, not just talking on cholera break-out (you can spend 20 minutes in Wikipedia to read all related to it). It shows you what was a society, population, medicine/science, living and dying conditions in Victorian's London in 1854."

Within 3 days 127 people in the neighborhood would die. By the end of this outbreak 616 people died from the infection. This outbreak is notable because it lead to a breakthrough in learning how cholera spread. At the time it was thought to have spread through the air, a belief brought about by London's famous and unbearable stench. The Rev. Henry Whitehead and Dr. John Snow (he actually knew quite a bit) worked together, talking to the people living in the neighborhood and tracking the illness, and put together a new theory. The water was contaminated. Their hard work and theories would lead to the development of the London sewer system, and some of their mapping techniques were the early versions of the geolocation technology that we use every day when we google ""Nearby restaurants"" on our smart phones.The author can be a bit dense, but the information is fascinating. I love how he was able to tie an epidemic more than 150 years ago to modern urban planning, water quality, population density discussions, alcohol tolerance, and technology that was just starting when he wrote the book 10 years ago. I just found it fascinating. And he managed to write an entire book about cholera without once using the word ""shit."" Rather impressive."
48,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"This was an excellent account of the (successful) efforts of two men, John Snow and Henry Whitehead, to understand the means by which cholera is transmitted, following an 1854 outbreak in London's Soho district. The ""ghost map"" constructed by Snow, and the identification of the index case by Whitehead, were eventually successful in displacing the prevailing ""miasma theory"" by establishing linkage beyond reasonable doubt to contamination at a single water pump (the Broad Street pump).Johnson does an excellent job of providing a tightly-constructed account of the events during, and immediately following, the week when the epidemic was at its height. He is also very effective in placing the two men's discovery in historical context, and in giving a broader perspective on its significance. An absorbing account of a milestone in epidemiology, at a level of scholarship that far surpasses that of the other work by this author that I had read ""Everything Bad is Good for You"". I highly recommend this book. Likely to be of most interest to readers who enjoy history, or with an interest in epidemiology or urban development."

A triumph of scientific research and deep local knowledge, the cause was found and contained even though no one yet knew of the microbe that causes the disease.

I said to my partner multiple times while reading, so I suppose that's my review: Cholera is fascinating, or rather the relationship between social structures, social practice/knowledge, and disease is fascinating. Johnson has an unexpectedly present voice, opinionated and even chiding as he focuses on central figures of cholera research while knocking down the great man theory and placing them, and their discoveries and achievements, within that same social context. It's specific, clearly-drawn, interconnected, compelling--and frustrating, sometimes for the wrong reasons.Namely the epilogue, which segues into a disjointed, overreaching ""what now?"" that looks to the future of relationships between society and disease. It's bleakly hilarious to read during the COVID-19 pandemic, because all the theorycrafting about maps and the power of the internet is rendered obviously ridiculous--while the underlying thesis about the social element of a disease, which remains heartbreakingly pertinent, is nearly buried."
53,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel,2,"Likes: Throughout history, there have been some extremely brave people. The doctors and cholera investigators in this book should definitely be put in the “extremely brave” category. In 1850s London, no one knew what caused the cholera outbreak. People were either dying in droves or frantically trying to escape the city. A few researchers ignored their instinct to run from the disease. They ventured deeper into London to find the cause of cholera. I enjoyed reading the stories of the investigators and how they methodically uncovered the way the disease spread.I think the moral of this book is to not cling so tightly to your ideas that you ignore or dismiss anything that doesn’t fit with your worldview. You could be missing something important. In the 1800s, scientists believed that cholera came from bad-smelling air. They refused to listen to any alternate theories. By refusing to be open-minded, they did a lot of damage to humans and to the environment. Even though the London cholera outbreak happened a long time ago, modern people can still learn from it.“Superstition, then and now, is not just a threat to the truth. It’s also a threat to national security.” – The Ghost MapDislikes: I only like narrative nonfiction. I hate reading textbooks. From the synopsis, this book sounds narrative, like it has a plot. The author does tell the story of the cholera researchers, but the plot is broken up by long, tedious chapters about sewer construction and city planning. I got bored enough that I skimmed parts of it.The Bottom Line: I wanted to read about people solving a scientific mystery. The mystery turns out to be only a small part of the book. The rest of it is a textbook. I was mostly bored.I have a blog! Check it out if you like reviews, giveaways, and bookish nonsense."
54,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761499-carrie,5,"Although some people might not find this a page-turning read, the public health and infectious disease geek in me did. I'd already known about John Snow's epidemiologic prowess in London's mid-nineteenth-century cholera outbreak and its ties to the Broad Street Pump. I even visited the site of the pump on a trip to London. I did not, however, know about the amount of resistance he got from the public health board of the day. Their insistence on miasma (bad air) as the cause for the outbreak, and essentially all outbreaks, certainly contributed to a number of deaths. Smelly air made you sick was their thought. I also did not know about Henry Whitehead, a local clergyman whose ties with the community and amateur epidemiologic sleuthing aided John Snow in his discovery. Both men played a significant role in connecting cholera to contaminated water. It seems obvious to us now, but back then, when so many professionals believed bad air was the cause of disease, the two men had their work cut out for them.There's lots of talk about poo and waste and noxious smells in this book. If you don't mind that, and you enjoy historical accounts of public health and disease theory, then you'll probably like this book. Near the end, there is also a discussion by the author on urbanization and population growth. Some of the book is scattered timewise, and there are a few dull bits, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it."

Cholera epidemics broke out periodically in London; this book is about the 1854 epidemic and how the scientists started to understand that all disease wasn't caused by miasma, but that cholera was a waterborne disease contracted when the waste of a cholera victim was ingested through sewage in water supplies.

Johnson evidently takes great enjoyment in tying together the threads of the story from the molecular level (how does cholera thrive in the small intestine?) to the level of a city (how does cholera thrive in a neighborhood?). Unfortunately, he gets overenthusiastic and offers a lumpy, excessively long epilogue on the perils of modern city living. The book is at its best when Johnson colorfully illustrates Victorian slum life and Dr. John Snow's dogged efforts to trace cholera's spread from street to street."

On one level The Ghost Map is an gripping detective story with the embattled Snow tracking down evidence to make his case. On another level it is about human psychology and just how hard it is for people to struggle against confirmation bias and change deeply rooted beliefs. In the right hands this book would make a good movie.Johnson writes about Victorian London with a Dickensian grittiness that I enjoyed, and he also discusses the important impact that Snow’s ideas have in the modern world.

60,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"London in the 1800s was utterly disgusting. You cram two million people and sundry livestock into one Victorian city, add stinky professions such as tanners and renderers, and then put them all on top of all the crap two million people produce, and no sewage system to put it in, it's going to stink. And stink powerfully.Clearly, something had to be done. Unfortunately, the leaders of the city picked the wrong thing to do. They decided to clean up the city by funneling all the waste into the Thames, which, by the way, was the source of drinking water for much of the city. See a problem?The Thames went from being a clean river full of salmon and other fish, to a stinking cesspool of murky water in about 20 years.At the same time, diseases such as cholera were spreading more quickly, thanks to improvements in transportation. London was perfectly set up to have an outbreak - it was just a matter of time.And when the outbreak hit, jumping the channel from Hamburg to London in 1853, it hit hard and fast. So hard that even though they couldn't see the cholera bacteria yet, they could see its footprints through the ferocity of the attack. It became possible to trace the source of the disease - if you bothered to look, and didn't just blame it on the stink, or miasma, which was what the leading authorities of the time did. It was up to an iconoclastic doctor and a local clergyman, both of whom were from the neighborhood struck by the cholera outbreak, to study the patterns of who got sick and who didn't, and map it, to uncover the true source.Their efforts were so conclusive and irrefutable that it couldn't be pooh-poohed by the miasmatists, and it eventually led to new sewer system being installed throughout London. The principals of their methods - applying scientific principals to carefully gathered data, and mapping it out, instead of falling back on superstition and assumption - are still being used today.The tale of the outbreak and the investigators was horrifying and fascinating to read about, and the first part of the book went quickly. But when the author started to draw conclusions, he didn't know when to stop. Again and again, the reader was informed of the virtues of applying local knowledge in scientific ways. And then, after drilling that into the readers' heads, the author then switched to speculation about possible outbreaks in the future. And not just from disease, but also from terrorist attacks and nuclear bombs. I guess because the focus is not really on cholera here, but on how population density makes it possible for both disease and for bombs to kill way more people at once.But at the same time, we're told, cities are GOOD, because of the efficient ways energy is used in them. People need less energy to heat and cool their homes, to get to and from work, etc. Things at the end of this book just got a little scattered in focus, and repetitious. I alternated between being bored and intrigued. I could tell the author had done a lot of research on the cholera outbreak, but not spent as much time deciding which conclusion he wanted to draw from it - so he included every thought he'd had about it.Worth a read, this book really made me grateful for the modern plumbing and sewage systems I have access to.

I have read a lot of books lately about sanitation, its history, the current status in undeveloped countries and possible methods of improvement. The Ghost Map is the story of 1850’s London, when raw sewage was being pumped directly into the Thames River and then pumped back out again to provide drinking water to millions of people. As one would expect, illness and death soon followed. But why? What was causing the issues? At this time, science had yet to discover microbes and so most great minds of the time blamed the air. Which in retrospect seemed to be self-evident. “The Great Stink” which enveloped London during this time is famous. Read any book or memoirs set in London in the mid eighteenth century and every one will contain a comment on the smell. Before the sewage was pumped into the river, it built up in basements, streets, etc. It was not uncommon for a basement to build up with 4-5 feet of raw human waste. The smell must have been unbearable. So, the air theory made sense. It wasn’t until Dr. John Snow begin applying a scientific method to determine the root cause that water was identified as the source of the illness cholera. Cholera is an unforgiving disease. After consuming the tainted water, a person could be dead within 24 hours (some hung on for days). An outbreak could kill hundreds if not thousands in a week’s time. And as quickly as it comes, it disappears. Scientists and governmental officials of the time blamed fetid air, especially the air in the poorer sections of London. It was felt that poverty and cholera went hand in hand. Dr. Snow changed all that. A humble man who became a doctor to Queen Victoria (he applied the chloroform used in the birth of one of her last children); Dr. Snow had an immense curiosity coupled with a dedication to the “scientific method”. He set out to find how the illness was being spread. Using the mortality rate schedules, he was able to create a map which showed the houses where the deaths had been the worse and drawing upon his knowledge of the area, eventually determined the source was a public water pump. The most fascinating part of the story which help sealed his discovery was the death of a woman much further outside the “hot zone”. When he discovered that she grew up in the infected area and preferred the water from the pump in question, he knew he had discovered the source. The handle came off the pump and the disease stopped in its tracks. Acceptance gradually grew until within twenty years there were no more reported cases of cholera in Great Britain.I found the story fascinating and the author widens the view, discussing sanitation, scientific methods, contagion theories, etc. Using the cholera epidemic as a starting point, the reader is invited to see the broader implications of disease control and how cities in particular can be impacted. I highly recommend the book!"
62,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"I vaguely knew the story of how removing a pump handle stopped a cholera epidemic, but this book goes into a fascinating level of detail.Cholera was one of the big terrifying diseases of the 1800s—as the author notes, you just had to live with the knowledge that, no matter how healthy you were, at any point you (and your entire family) could be wiped out in a day and a half and no one knew how to stop or prevent it. Cholera moves shockingly fast by basically causing the body to expell all of its water in a messy, nasty, fantastically painful and scary way to die. We know now that it's a water-bourne disease that can be best treated by rapid rehydration, but for a long time, scientists were convinced that, like malaria, cholera was caused by bad smells. So it took a lot of courage, both physical and moral, to map a particularly virulant outbreak and then stand up to scientific orthodoxy and declare that the cause of the outbreak was a single pump. It would take awhile for the declaration to finally be accepted. (Meanwhile, New York would go on a massive anti-cholera clean-up that, while it targeted entirely the wrong thing, removed most of the shit from the streets and made the city as a whole enormously more healthy. For once, bad science had good results.)This is a fascinating book, if you're into this kind of thing. Towards the end, it starts to drift oddly, musing on the modern nature of cities and disasters and such in a way that implies the author had some opinions he wanted to get off his chest and nowhere better to put them. They're interesting, if so tangential to the topic as to be irrelevant. But despite this lack of discipline (perhaps the book felt too short?), it's a good read. "
63,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36603555-katherine-addison,5,"This is a cross-disciplinary study of a problem solved, in 1854, by cross-disciplinary thinking. It's also a wonderful snapshot of Victorian London, a meditation on the urbanization of our species, a jeremiad against belief-based reasoning (his specific target is the belief in ""miasma""--that theory that disease was transmitted by smell--that led to the city of London choosing to dump its raw sewage directly into the Thames and thus did crusaders for public health cause the devastating cholera epidemics of the mid nineteenth century, but he makes the parallel with Intelligent Design explicit, too), and several other things. It's also beautifully written; the prose is both lucid and entertaining. (My favorite line: ""It's true enough that the Victorians were grappling with heady issues like utilitarianism and class consciousness. But the finest minds of the era were also devoted to an equally pressing question: What are we going to do with all of this shit?"") Because Johnson is a cross-disciplinarian, he understands how to use fiction as a primary source (an undertaking which has gotten the better of many otherwise excellent historians--and, of course, the reverse is, if possible, even more true), and thus won my undying devotion. Also, he has hit upon an elegant solution to the problem of writing a scholarly book for a popular audience. No footnotes or numbered endnotes to disrupt the flow of thought and words as you're reading, but if you want to know, the endnotes are there, labeled with page number and the relevant phrase. And he's got his bibliography back there, too.This is an excellent book, and--perhaps bizarrely for a book about a horrifying epidemic--it made me feel both happy and more optimistic than usual about our species."
64,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144065-sara,5,"I really lucked out this semester in my Cities & Health course by getting a chance to read The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson. The book, both a thrilling jaunt into the past and a terrifying look at the possibilities of the future, centers on 1854 London during the city's worst Cholera outbreak. The book follows a unorthodox Doctor, Dr. John Snow, and a man with his ear to the streets, Reverend Henry Whitehead, in the Golden Square neighborhood in Central London. The book chronicles the doctor's challenge in proving that Cholera was (and is) a waterborne disease during a time when popular theory was that diseases were passed from one person to another and epidemics spread through the air. Now this book won't be for everyone, clearly, as the book's central focus is on Cholera, a disease that makes you pour from both ends until there's nothing left. Literally. No bones about it, London sounds like a terrifyingly disgusting place to live back in the 1800s.Eventually Dr. Snow has his day and Cholera is proven as a waterborne disease. There is much more to be learned from the book besides how diseases are spread, and that is what we focused the beginning of the semester on. It also tells the story about how cities were formed, the birth of infrastructure, the birth of sanitation, and much more. I highly recommend this book to those without a weak stomach who are eager for a Non-fiction."

It’s good in some places, but I was left with a sense of “meh” by the end.He ends with a long Conclusion and then an Epilogue where he touches on tentatively-connected subjects — epidemics, electronic maps, technology, urbanization, emergency services, public health services, global warming, terrorism, energy use, population growth, developing countries. You’d think he wrote the book just so he could spout his ideas about these things.Quote:“Hall’s instructions for his cholera committee offer a brilliant case study in how dominant intellectual paradigms can make it more difficult for the truth to be established, even if the people involved are smart, and attentive, and methodical in their research.”Oh, how these words apply in more ways than Johnson would ever care to admit.Similar titles would be Very, Very, Very Dreadful: The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 or Influenza: The Hundred-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History."

It was how these two men started out from opposite points and came to the same conclusion. It is also interesting to read of a time period so different from ours. I kept wanting to tell the people to wash their hands or instruments. The book starts out slowly with more information on cholera and London than you think you want to know, but it is necessary to understand just how little they knew about the spread of the disease. I have to think back to how we felt when AIDS burst on the scene. No one knew how it passed from person to person. A friend of mine was one of the earliest researchers of the disease and he wanted to study AIDS because so many of the early researchers were contracting it. He went on to be one of the foremost experts on the disease and, in a way, became very much like Dr. Snow. Unlike most historical mysteries, this book wraps everything up very much like Miss Marple. The doctor is finally able to reach back to patient ""0"" and everything clicks into place. It is unbelievable how strong Dr. Snow was as he went against the ""misama"" theory of infection. Even when the smoking gun is found there were still people in the medical field who would not change their minds."

The author did a lot of homework on how the cholera spread through the city, how it was investigated, where people died, and how the clash in opinion on how it was spread changed the way we see disease being investigated and cured. John Snow (ehm, DR. John Snow) was a real life superhero. What began as just a curious look into the disease ended up saving thousands of people's lives. He had no special training, just an inquisitive mind that kept him asking more and more questions and going against the common belief of the time. He went against people who were in power in order to change the way they saw the spread of disease. Needless to say, it was not easy to convince people of new ideas back in a day and he was met with many people questioning his every word. Snow was a simple man who had a big drive, yet history nearly forgot his contribution. Without him, we would not have giant cities with massive system of waste removal that keeps epidemics from obliterating us all. It goes to show one man can truly alter the future if he has the drive and strong ambition. Thank you, John Snow. "

He gave us each a booklet with a map and told us that every few days, people would die from various locations on the map. There was a giant copy of the map posted in the hallway, which would be the master marked with red dots as people kicked the bucket. If we kept careful track of when and where people died, we could solve the mystery of the spreading of this disease. Not known as one for details, I quickly grew bored and stopped paying attention. Thankfully, we weren't graded on that task! But I've always wondered about that real life mystery. What really happened? Why did so many people die? Who solved it? When I saw this book at the library, also marked with a red dot, I immediately recalled the long ago assignment and knew I'd finally found the answers to the real life story.

At the time of the Cholera outbreak, London's policy to deal with sewage actually caused and worsened the outbreak killing thousands and thousands of people. I cannot quite wrap my mind around the concept of cess pools in basements nor the concept that the dumping of sewage from the entire urban area into that same urban area's drinking water was considered to be an achievement by the city's planners. Descriptions of the manner in which people died were almost too much for me, not because it was gruesomely written but because it was described so truthfully and painfully. I could not help but imagine my entire family stricken by cholera, my children suffering and all of us being unaware that by simply ingesting large amounts of clean water myself and my family would be saved. This account is well-researched and an interesting read."
72,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5258589-sarah,2,"This started very promising. I was fascinated by the different menial jobs of 1850's London that contributed to a bustling economy, the earliest forms of ""recycling,"" and the rise of a modern city. The detailed science behind the spread of the bacteria leading to the outbreak of cholera was also quite compelling. However, the latter half of the book dragged quite a bit after Dr. Snow and Mr. Whitehead discovered the cause. I'm always slightly irritated when a book is not as culled as it could be. And that entire Epilogue? A word to the wise - skip it. It's filled with meandering philosophical pondering on the growth of cities, vaccinations, nuclear proliferation, and terrorism. It felt like the beginnings of another book entirely. Lastly, a cautionary note - don't read this if you're squeamish - the varied, graphic, and extensive discussion of shit (SO many synonyms) had me grimacing as I listened on my way to work every morning."

The mortality rate of city living wasn't good and cholera wiped out whole neighborhoods. Two men did the research and concluded it was in the water (a specific pump to be exact). It took a decade for people to recognize any validity in that. This was interesting in a science/history kind of way."

79,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"What better way to finish up 2017 reading than with a book on the 1854 London cholera epidemic? It works much better than I thought it would.This is terrific book on the efforts of two men to understand the causes of a cholera outbreak in the Soho area of London in 1854. What made this especially difficult is that the bacterial basis of diseases was not understood at all, the specific details of cholera were unknown, and medical research as we have come to known it did not exist, and medical practice itself was not well developed. With that in mind, the prevailing stories about cholera focused on problems in the air and very frequently tracked longstanding class biases. Add to this that cholera is a terrifying disease (see the book for details) that killed its victims rapidly and the drama of this story can be easily understood. This is a fascinating story which makes me never want to go back to the “good old days”.The book is valuable on several levels. It is first of all a scientific detective story in which one can easily root for the good guys to succeed. It is more than that, however, and one is left to marvel how large metropolitan areas that we take for granted in the West — ever became viable places where people could thrive and not fall victim to epidemics, famines, or other natural and social catastrophes. At the start of the 1800s, the life expectancy in Britain was likely below 40. Today it is closer to double that. This means that a lot more people are in effect living twice as long. Events such as those in this book are among the reasons for the elongation of life spans and the improved standard of living in the West. As the author notes towards the end of the book, megacities in the developing world are coming to dwarf most large Western metropolitan areas and are places where public health that we have come to take for granted cannot be asssumed to be present. Cholera is still around and new outbreaks are highly likely. This story is relevant today and we should not take our public health for granted.The story provides a nice case study of how science progresses and how old theories are replaced by new ones eventually. The follow up in the book about the development of the London sewer and water systems is especially informative. This is relevant in the US as well. As the author notes the reversal of the direction of the Chicago River was prompted by a cholera outbreak. As Gordon’s recent book on the American standard of living shows convincingly, some of the greatest bang for the buck in US economic history came from the development of effective infrastructure, including public water and sewer systems.The Ghost map also has implications for the value of different sorts of knowledge. The case was important for some famous representations of the outbreak on local maps in order to understand the spread of cases and especially deaths. The author makes a strong case that this was not just a simple matter of mapping but more an example of making good use of “local knowledge”. The key breakthrough came when Reverend Whitehead made good use of his knowledge of the neighborhood to understand how the outbreak developed and which theories to support about the outbreak. This has all sorts of implications for information dynamics today. To sell this, consider how life on the internet changed for users when GPS data became from available after 2000. A general search of the web can now be augmented with a localized search tied to various mapping functions. ... and the rest is internet history. That’s right - a connection between mapping cholera in 19th century London and finding out the best route to work with an application like Waze. This interplay of generalized versus local knowledge is a major aspect data work today and it is fascinating to see how such issues developed with 19th century tools and sensibilities and before the growth of modern science.I don’t want to draw out all the potential story lines and perhaps Johnson tries to do a bit much with this case. It is a first rate story, however, and well worth reading. This book has been around for a few years but it fit in well with recent books on the Spanish Flu and Tuberculosis. Disease histories are not for everyone, but if you are up to it, this is a fine book."
80,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19482608-wil,5,"General thoughts  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in world history and the beginnings of public health and medicine.The Ghost Map is an all-encompassing historical narrative about the cholera outbreaks in London 150 years ago which laid the foundation of epidemiology. This story illustrates cholera from the cellular to global scale surrounding the London outbreak of 1854. The Ghost Map  mainly discusses how the setting in London and the unique attributes of John Snow and Reverend Whitehead enabled them to make an incredible discovery amidst incredible adversity.Since the concept of combining the scientific methods medicine and public health consumes my thoughts, this book was incredibly enjoyable. Something unmentioned, but noteworthy, is that Cholera still affects 3-5 million people every year, despite the fact that cholera was essentially extinguished from London 140 years ago.I wished that the book would offer some of the maps that Dr. Snow created during his research. For those interested, here's a good source: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia... The Ghost Map – Synopsis 	This book begins by illustrating London’s attempt to be sanitary and sustainable by managing its waste through night-soil men. These workers weren’t only removing human excrement from cesspools; they were recycling it, making the surrounding farmland more fertile and capable of supporting the London population. However, as the city grew, waste management became more difficult and expensive, leading to an inevitable rise of unsanitary conditions and Cholera outbreaks.	The first few chapters illustrates the city of London at the time – from the presence great minds like Mozart and Dickens to the unavoidable smell of human excrement and decaying bodies. London's population explosion caused it to flourish and decay at the same time. The first chapter ends with the death of a baby who had caught Cholera, foreshadowing an inevitable outbreak.	Though London at the time was the largest city in the world, explanatory models for disease were still medieval. Cholera was blamed on the putrid smell of London, the miasma theory. This theory was well accepted by medical professionals and government officials despite the fact that there was no statistical data proving it. Yet, the miasma theory held for untold years, until a critical thinking doctor, John Snow, attempted to solve the case. 	As a groundbreaking anesthesiologist, John Snow understood the dynamics of gases and saw that the spread of cholera couldn’t possibly fit the miasma model. For instance, sewer workers seemed incredibly healthy despite breathing supposedly noxious fumes on a daily basis. However, the miasma theory was deeply engrained belief in London’s society. The 1854 outbreak described in this book was the perfect storm, giving John Snow much needed statistical evidence and credibility that would not only shed light on cholera's etiology, but also launch a new way of thinking about health, epidemiological research, and taking practical measures to prevent disease."
81,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825151-jason-payne,2,"It's probably because I read it immediately after catching up on vastly superior works by Eric Larson, but this is not a terribly compelling book, and it disappointed the heck out of me. Little more than an expanded college thesis--an evolution to which the author admits in his afterward--this is about 150 pages longer than it needs to be. The tone set by its lack of characterization and focus on dry historical facts outstays its welcome about 20 pages in.While it's interesting to note some of the things going on here, the last 80+ pages are nothing more than generic musings on urbanization, the expansion of civilized society, and what pandemics might mean and look like in the future. It's no stretch to say that I could feasibly sit down right now and write in a similar vein on pretty much any subject with which I am familiar. Was there no one editing this before it went to print?Oh, and the best part is, the titular ""map"" is never once referred to as a ""ghost map"", and although it is described in elaborate and loving detail, *the book DOES NOT CONTAIN A COPY OF THIS MAP*. WTF? Could be that I had the Kindle edition, but that only makes the omission the more glaringly inexplicable.Also, I'd estimate that at least 25% of the actual text of the book (not counting the vacant fluff about urbanization that comprises the Epilogue) is plagiarized--oh, I mean, quoted. When every chapter contains several multi-page quotations, you're either too enamored of the source material to invoke it in an interesting manner, or you're too destitute for ideas of your own that you simply crib extant work and hope nobody notices. The worst part is, Johnson clearly loves his Dickens as one of his few means of characterizing Victorian slumdwellers, but more often than not he assumes the reader not only has read Dickens extensively, but can recall key passages from memory.My biggest disappointment, however, is the lost opportunities. Someone with less of a singular focus on disease and more of a focus on economics may have made more of the topic. Johnson leads off with a great description of the various strata of improvised filth-raking, but then abandons the entire concept for the rest of the book. This is where Larson shines by comparison--characterizing two interweaving narratives in a manner that makes even the driest subject compelling. Nothing approaching that to be found here, unfortunately.All in all, probably not worth your time, except as a means to underscore how adept even the weakest Larson is by contrast."
82,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3869411-gwnhwyfer,3,"""Ghost Map"" : Take Two When I initially read Steven Johnson's ""Ghost map"" a few years back, I was either young and impressionable or I skipped parts. I'm betting on the latter. In looking for something while trying out my library's eAudio selections (their non-fiction is poor), I decided to reread ""Ghost map."" The first half (and some of the conclusion) was as interesting as I remembered (as interesting as you can get when talking about disease and death) and I would recommend it. As other reviewers have pointed out the author does have a slightly annoying habit of repeating himself - which during the first half I could forgive. The author also tends to meander between topics (before returning to the story of the outbreak) which personally I don't mind (and which I love when it's done well), but could be off-putting to others expecting a straight-forward account. I would also recommend the book as opposed to the audio. I hated the narration. The reader spoke too fast and at times was monotone. But what drove me nuts was that he (as an apparent non-British speaker) would start a quote with a British accent, but halfway through the accent would disappear. There were also sections where a quote would end and the author begin, but it wasn't clearly delineated during the reading. In my opinion, skip the conclusion and the epilogue. The latter was especially painful. Johnson only mentions the importance of the map (which I was ignorant of, being only an occasional popular science reader) during his conclusion. It would have been more helpful (and interesting) as a said layman reader, for him to have brought out the importance of the map (and hence the title of his book) earlier, or (better yet) earmarked an entire chapter to it's legacy. Instead, the reader has to wade through a muddled theory of how city life is better for us and the environment, despite terrorists (the twin tower deaths were no big deal, btw)* and a super flu. Though I live in a fairly large city, and it's convenient and useful (and while I will probably remain in a city for the remainder of my life, I'm not particularly attached to city life), I find his constant ""city is everything"" methodology annoying (and cities without green space, really?)*While that's not what Johnson said or meant, the way he phrased that section made it seem as if he were belittling (not in the sense of making light of, but more brushing aside) the loss of human life. This is my opinion of his writing - you may see it differently."

Suffice it to say I weigh about 5 pounds less than I did this morning.)Edited to add (after finishing the book)I found this an informative and interesting book, detailing the infamous outbreak of cholera in one area and the tracing it back to patient 1 and contamination of the Broad Street pump. At the time, the prevailing theory of disease was miasma (bad air and poor conditions). The idea of bacteria was not widely known or even called that. The story of this outbreak and its control was the story of perseverance of one man, and then the united front he had ultimately with detractors who became supporters and even friends. Snow ultimately convinced people of the problem with the Broad Street pump by the making of a now famous map. If you are interested (as I was) do a search on the internet or click this link which will take your to UCLA's school of public health and a online copy of the map. Even someone not skilled in epidemiology can pick out where the pump was by the deepening of dark lines indicating deaths. Fascinating.The epilogue/afterward of the book was just as fascinating as the story because the author related his own beliefs of city living and of how in today's modern world the role of bacteria in thinning the human population may be being taken over by terrorism.

It was clear London needed a new sewage system.  Opening the pages of this most impressive account of sleuthing the source of the cholera outbreak was simply fascinating. Reverend Henry Whitehead and Dr. John Snow, two strangers of different backgrounds, joined together by circumstance shared valuable information and expertise. Independently each spent countless of hours interviewing, recording, and analyzing all collected data. The scientific mind of Dr. Snow compiled a map indicating the location and number of deaths therein. Whitehead as a trusted, respected local was key in turning the made up minds of city agencies who stubbornly clung to the idea the disease originated in the foul, smelly air to accepting the actual catalyst for the outbreak. This is really an outstanding detective story very well told. A history lesson if you will. The facts, players and uncanny elusiveness of this indiscriminate killer called cholera progressed systematically without the bog down of boring statistics.

But then you get to the epilogue, and it becomes clear that Johnson wrote the book solely so he could stick his epilogue on the end. It appears to be a master's thesis or PhD thesis proposal that attempts a medico-scientific apologia for dense urbanization. I am unquestionably a city mouse, but am uneasy in some ways to be so removed from the food producing system. I guess the point was to assuage the fears of urban dwellers that we are bad for the planet, but it didn't do much for me. The discussion of nuclear attacks and biological attacks was odd, and the complete absence of mention of chemical/poison attacks was a big hole. The epilogue was altogether random and clearly had an agenda and diminished the book in my mind."
86,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829220-jenn,4,"This is really my favorite type of book so I'd have to say I'm probably a bit partial on the one hand, on the other hand I've read quite a few epidemiologically inclined books and they all have to stand up to the scrutiny of comparison. I enjoyed the way this one was written and the splendid detail it went into, revealing the humanity of the tragedy while simultaneously engaging you in the science fueling the cause and effect of this epidemic... it unfolded like a horrific microbial murder mystery. However while the book isn't terribly long, I think the last two chapters wander off into a wholly separate discussion on urban development in the context of global health that didn't really have much of anything to do with the meat of the book. It could've easily been left out - should've been left out. If the author really wanted to segue into another topic I would've thought that perhaps delving more fully into the ramifications Dr. Snow's map had on the visual display of quantitative information would've been more appropriate. Oh! And they *probably* should've included a full image of the actual map in the book - kinda a big miss there. With that said I would still recommend this book to anyone who might be interested in disease, epidemics or history. Fascinating!"

I usually put a book down if I am bored by the first 20 pages but this time I pressed on because I find the SUBJECT MATTER interesting and I kept expecting things to pick up. I have read various books on the subjects of bacteria, viruses and microbiology in general, and they usually do not disappoint. However, Johnson's writing is extremely dry and I swear he found ways to say the same thing over and over repeatedly throughout different chapters. How many times does one need to read the praises of an admired man, and to be reminded that this man was no trained scientist, but rather a native of the area who relied on his investigative mind and knowledge of the habits of the locals to crack the case? Apparently the author thinks twenty times might be sufficient. This whole thing brought to mind very fleshed out papers in which college students ran out of words well before they should have and merely reiterated former statements with more emphasis. After a while I knew the book would get no better but I was halfway through and I wanted to be sure this book deserved every ill word I would write about it, and I can say without hesitation that it surely does. "
88,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5663034-k,4,"This book is about shit. Well, more precisely it's about how the lack of proper sewage systems in Victorian London led to the 1854 outbreak of cholera in which 500 people died in less than two weeks within a only a few blocks. But more than that, it's the story of the birth of epidemiology through John Snow's work to trace the outbreak back to the Broad Street water pump. It's a fascinating story that's equal parts medical history, epidemiology, and philosophy. It's definitely not one for the sqeamish (I mean, there are people literally shitting themselves to death all over the place), but it's a detailed examination of the struggles that Snow - and his subsequent investigative partner, Henry Whitehead - went through in trying to get their theory heard and accepted. There's an entire section at the end dedicated to how dramatically different a major epidemic would be today compared to Victorian London. And there's a section on the impact that cities have had on the world, and how the birth of supercities continues to impact society. Basically, it's really readable despite all the people dying of cholera, and it's incredibly interesting. Go read it. Unless you're squeamish or prone to hypochondria. Then maybe don't..."

And he's okay with the science. But he struggles with crafting a narrative out the story of the Broad Street Pump and John Snow's and Henry Whitehead's contributions in forwarding the contamination theory of cholera - and don't get me wrong: it's a great story. Unfortunately Johnson seems to lose steam with these particular characters about halfway through the book and repeats the same points about the scientific method and the beautiful magical power of cities. This is also the topic of the last hundred pages, which become Johnson's TED-Talk soapbox moment on how wonderful New York is (delicatessens!) and how urbane urban folks are (theater!) and how bad terrorists (9/11!) and nuclear bombs are (boo, hiss!). You can feel free to skip that part.Also, for a book all about the power of a good infographic, the book is woefully deficient in them. The titular ghost map doesn't appear until the book is practically over, and only in a much deficient form. Where are those damn Voronoi diagrams? Rating: 2.5 stars"

The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine.

I find the practicalities of 19th Century urbanisation amid the Industrial Revolution very interesting, particularly in London. Gives extra depth to anyone who spends time reading Dickens or other fiction taking place at that time. Also anyone interested in GIS applications for medical information, how maps and topography are used to track epidemics, would find these early days super interesting. In the last chapter he touches on the way technology has changed the scale of disease tracking now that we have Google maps and geotagging, etc.Overall an interesting slice of history. And because they spent so much time talking about Soho and street names and maps, I looked up Snow's Cholera map to compare it with a modern map on Google well before I go to the end of the book. Putting street view onto the corner where the pump was located was a neat surprise, to see the name of the pub there."

It turned out that I knew the legend rather than the facts. This book is certainly packed with facts; however they are presented in such a clear attractive fashion,that it reads as easily as fiction. I heartily recommend this book. It is not just a book about an epidemic. It has a great deal to say about cities as machines for sustaining commerce, culture, employment and leisure. The Victorians had developed the machine, but lacked a trouble shooter's manual. They faced a deadly glitch in the form of a cholera epidemic in the time before antibiotics, public sanitation departments or even the knowledge of the germ method of contagion. It caused me to reflect on the complexity and vulnerability of our modern metropolises and to wonder where the next glitch may appear."

He traces the history of how London dealt with sewage and how it became such a big issue, and also examines some of the main characters in the drama of trying to stop the outbreak — and trying to challenge miasma theory, which was so much the paradigm at the time. There isn’t a lot of specific science stuff here, but Johnson makes clear why the cholera pathogen is so deadly in a very accessible way.The only weird part is in the conclusion/afterword to the book, where Johnson talks more generally about the risks to city life and starts discussing nuclear war and terrorism.

Unfortunately, the book dragged out over 200-plus pages the initial article I had read in class. It was notable that the tale focused on not only the celebrated Snow, but the until recently obscured local pastor, Whitehead, who really did the fieldwork that backed up Snow's waterborne theory. Only recommended to those who've never encountered this story in another format (and who won't wince at detailed descriptions of cholera symptoms). "

The book suddenly turns to molasses, and it appears he didn't know how to end it. After reading the end notes, I got the impression that he grafted his undergraduate thesis into the ending. He also goes off on some wild tangents (nuclear weapons elimination!) at the very end in essentially a double-I-just-can't-end the book ending.

114,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"Talk about a timely read. This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
115,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative. In addition, the lack of Snow’s maps and analysis, especially the key Voronoi one, seemed an important oversight. Overall, an okay read about an interesting case."
116,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"It’s the mid-19th century and London is a city. Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s not the most gripping nonfiction history book that I’ve read but history buffs may be interested in exploring this aspect of medical history.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"

But I'm STRONGER now and I finally read it! 💪I am very glad I read this as an audiobook because it would've been much harder for me to get through otherwise. I'm personally drawn to many things at once and would have probably put this down in favor of something else because it's dense with information and while well-researched and interesting, it's not exactly so riveting, I'd drop everything else. But I wanted to read this now and understand how it might relate to what's happening in the world today, especially in high-population cities.I didn't understand why so many ""experts"" at the time didn't take to theories of mass infection by ingesting water from the same location rather than ""because it smells so bad."" 😒 I do, however, know that what we consider common sense today was built by people who had to sway public opinions with what, at the time, was groundbreaking leaps in logic. ""The virus that causes such international panic does not exist yet"" 👀""Some experts think a pandemic on the order of 1918 is a near inevitability"" 👀👀""But we'll have the tools at our disposal to deal with the emerging threats if we're smart enough to deploy them."" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀It's a whole different animal to have a virus passed from human to human so easily and carelessly compared to diseases that arose from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary resources. Both nightmares, both harbingers of mass death, both serving as catalysts for advancement in vaccine medicine and genetic composition analysis."
118,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"
119,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46509180-lori,4,"Mind blown! The story took a bit to get going and there are definitely some dry parts. But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol. And many years ago, fewer people could do this. With humans moving from rural to urban centres we created some waste related issues for ourselves. The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine.

144,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"Talk about a timely read. This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
145,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative. In addition, the lack of Snow’s maps and analysis, especially the key Voronoi one, seemed an important oversight. Overall, an okay read about an interesting case."
146,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"It’s the mid-19th century and London is a city. Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s not the most gripping nonfiction history book that I’ve read but history buffs may be interested in exploring this aspect of medical history.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"

But I'm STRONGER now and I finally read it! 💪I am very glad I read this as an audiobook because it would've been much harder for me to get through otherwise. I'm personally drawn to many things at once and would have probably put this down in favor of something else because it's dense with information and while well-researched and interesting, it's not exactly so riveting, I'd drop everything else. But I wanted to read this now and understand how it might relate to what's happening in the world today, especially in high-population cities.I didn't understand why so many ""experts"" at the time didn't take to theories of mass infection by ingesting water from the same location rather than ""because it smells so bad."" 😒 I do, however, know that what we consider common sense today was built by people who had to sway public opinions with what, at the time, was groundbreaking leaps in logic. ""The virus that causes such international panic does not exist yet"" 👀""Some experts think a pandemic on the order of 1918 is a near inevitability"" 👀👀""But we'll have the tools at our disposal to deal with the emerging threats if we're smart enough to deploy them."" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀It's a whole different animal to have a virus passed from human to human so easily and carelessly compared to diseases that arose from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary resources. Both nightmares, both harbingers of mass death, both serving as catalysts for advancement in vaccine medicine and genetic composition analysis."
148,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"
149,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46509180-lori,4,"Mind blown! The story took a bit to get going and there are definitely some dry parts. But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol. And many years ago, fewer people could do this. With humans moving from rural to urban centres we created some waste related issues for ourselves. The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

174,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"Talk about a timely read. This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
175,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative. In addition, the lack of Snow’s maps and analysis, especially the key Voronoi one, seemed an important oversight. Overall, an okay read about an interesting case."
176,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"It’s the mid-19th century and London is a city. Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s not the most gripping nonfiction history book that I’ve read but history buffs may be interested in exploring this aspect of medical history.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"

But I'm STRONGER now and I finally read it! 💪I am very glad I read this as an audiobook because it would've been much harder for me to get through otherwise. I'm personally drawn to many things at once and would have probably put this down in favor of something else because it's dense with information and while well-researched and interesting, it's not exactly so riveting, I'd drop everything else. But I wanted to read this now and understand how it might relate to what's happening in the world today, especially in high-population cities.I didn't understand why so many ""experts"" at the time didn't take to theories of mass infection by ingesting water from the same location rather than ""because it smells so bad."" 😒 I do, however, know that what we consider common sense today was built by people who had to sway public opinions with what, at the time, was groundbreaking leaps in logic. ""The virus that causes such international panic does not exist yet"" 👀""Some experts think a pandemic on the order of 1918 is a near inevitability"" 👀👀""But we'll have the tools at our disposal to deal with the emerging threats if we're smart enough to deploy them."" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀It's a whole different animal to have a virus passed from human to human so easily and carelessly compared to diseases that arose from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary resources. Both nightmares, both harbingers of mass death, both serving as catalysts for advancement in vaccine medicine and genetic composition analysis."
178,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"
179,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46509180-lori,4,"Mind blown! The story took a bit to get going and there are definitely some dry parts. But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol. And many years ago, fewer people could do this. With humans moving from rural to urban centres we created some waste related issues for ourselves. The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
180,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10664133-nicola,5,"If you have a strong enough stomach to tolerate graphic descriptions of the state of sanitation in Victorian London, and you have an interest in epidemiology, this book is for you. It's fascinating! I will never look at a glass of water the same way again! Some other reviewers comment that this book meanders away from the main narrative describing the outbreak of cholera in London in 1854. The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine. "
181,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,4,"More like a 3.5. I greatly enjoyed this, though I can see the subject matter would be potentially super dry for some. I find the practicalities of 19th Century urbanisation amid the Industrial Revolution very interesting, particularly in London. Gives extra depth to anyone who spends time reading Dickens or other fiction taking place at that time. Also anyone interested in GIS applications for medical information, how maps and topography are used to track epidemics, would find these early days super interesting. In the last chapter he touches on the way technology has changed the scale of disease tracking now that we have Google maps and geotagging, etc.Overall an interesting slice of history. And because they spent so much time talking about Soho and street names and maps, I looked up Snow's Cholera map to compare it with a modern map on Google well before I go to the end of the book. Putting street view onto the corner where the pump was located was a neat surprise, to see the name of the pub there."

It turned out that I knew the legend rather than the facts. This book is certainly packed with facts; however they are presented in such a clear attractive fashion,that it reads as easily as fiction. I heartily recommend this book. It is not just a book about an epidemic. It has a great deal to say about cities as machines for sustaining commerce, culture, employment and leisure. The Victorians had developed the machine, but lacked a trouble shooter's manual. They faced a deadly glitch in the form of a cholera epidemic in the time before antibiotics, public sanitation departments or even the knowledge of the germ method of contagion. It caused me to reflect on the complexity and vulnerability of our modern metropolises and to wonder where the next glitch may appear."

He traces the history of how London dealt with sewage and how it became such a big issue, and also examines some of the main characters in the drama of trying to stop the outbreak — and trying to challenge miasma theory, which was so much the paradigm at the time. There isn’t a lot of specific science stuff here, but Johnson makes clear why the cholera pathogen is so deadly in a very accessible way.The only weird part is in the conclusion/afterword to the book, where Johnson talks more generally about the risks to city life and starts discussing nuclear war and terrorism.

Unfortunately, the book dragged out over 200-plus pages the initial article I had read in class. It was notable that the tale focused on not only the celebrated Snow, but the until recently obscured local pastor, Whitehead, who really did the fieldwork that backed up Snow's waterborne theory.

The book suddenly turns to molasses, and it appears he didn't know how to end it. After reading the end notes, I got the impression that he grafted his undergraduate thesis into the ending.

This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
205,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative.

206,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"It’s the mid-19th century and London is a city. Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s not the most gripping nonfiction history book that I’ve read but history buffs may be interested in exploring this aspect of medical history.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"
207,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73019578-rachel,3,"3.25 stars. My high school friend lent me this book almost a decade ago and I just didn't read it because it intimidated me. But I'm STRONGER now and I finally read it! 💪I am very glad I read this as an audiobook because it would've been much harder for me to get through otherwise. I'm personally drawn to many things at once and would have probably put this down in favor of something else because it's dense with information and while well-researched and interesting, it's not exactly so riveting, I'd drop everything else. But I wanted to read this now and understand how it might relate to what's happening in the world today, especially in high-population cities.I didn't understand why so many ""experts"" at the time didn't take to theories of mass infection by ingesting water from the same location rather than ""because it smells so bad."" 😒 I do, however, know that what we consider common sense today was built by people who had to sway public opinions with what, at the time, was groundbreaking leaps in logic. ""The virus that causes such international panic does not exist yet"" 👀""Some experts think a pandemic on the order of 1918 is a near inevitability"" 👀👀""But we'll have the tools at our disposal to deal with the emerging threats if we're smart enough to deploy them."" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀It's a whole different animal to have a virus passed from human to human so easily and carelessly compared to diseases that arose from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary resources. Both nightmares, both harbingers of mass death, both serving as catalysts for advancement in vaccine medicine and genetic composition analysis."
208,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"
209,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46509180-lori,4,"Mind blown! The story took a bit to get going and there are definitely some dry parts. But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol. And many years ago, fewer people could do this. With humans moving from rural to urban centres we created some waste related issues for ourselves. The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
210,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10664133-nicola,5,"If you have a strong enough stomach to tolerate graphic descriptions of the state of sanitation in Victorian London, and you have an interest in epidemiology, this book is for you. It's fascinating! I will never look at a glass of water the same way again! Some other reviewers comment that this book meanders away from the main narrative describing the outbreak of cholera in London in 1854. The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine. "
211,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,4,"More like a 3.5. I greatly enjoyed this, though I can see the subject matter would be potentially super dry for some. I find the practicalities of 19th Century urbanisation amid the Industrial Revolution very interesting, particularly in London. Gives extra depth to anyone who spends time reading Dickens or other fiction taking place at that time. Also anyone interested in GIS applications for medical information, how maps and topography are used to track epidemics, would find these early days super interesting. In the last chapter he touches on the way technology has changed the scale of disease tracking now that we have Google maps and geotagging, etc.Overall an interesting slice of history. And because they spent so much time talking about Soho and street names and maps, I looked up Snow's Cholera map to compare it with a modern map on Google well before I go to the end of the book. Putting street view onto the corner where the pump was located was a neat surprise, to see the name of the pub there."

It all started with one microorganism...It was capable to kill thousands of people. Learn about London’s most dreadful epidemic. It made me feel so nervous and suspicious, because of that mysterious origin of the bacteria… This novel truly uncovered for me the importance of interdependece and the life order the earth depends on. This novel uncovered for me that competition in scientific world can help and motivate people greatly. Three different scientists using such various methods to trace the virus led them to unite at one point their discoveries for one final step: discovering the origin causing such dreadful consequences.

It turned out that I knew the legend rather than the facts. This book is certainly packed with facts; however they are presented in such a clear attractive fashion,that it reads as easily as fiction. I heartily recommend this book. It is not just a book about an epidemic. It has a great deal to say about cities as machines for sustaining commerce, culture, employment and leisure. The Victorians had developed the machine, but lacked a trouble shooter's manual. They faced a deadly glitch in the form of a cholera epidemic in the time before antibiotics, public sanitation departments or even the knowledge of the germ method of contagion. It caused me to reflect on the complexity and vulnerability of our modern metropolises and to wonder where the next glitch may appear."
214,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a really good account of the outbreak of cholera that led to John Snow’s famous map, showing that a particular water pump was the culprit. He traces the history of how London dealt with sewage and how it became such a big issue, and also examines some of the main characters in the drama of trying to stop the outbreak — and trying to challenge miasma theory, which was so much the paradigm at the time. There isn’t a lot of specific science stuff here, but Johnson makes clear why the cholera pathogen is so deadly in a very accessible way.The only weird part is in the conclusion/afterword to the book, where Johnson talks more generally about the risks to city life and starts discussing nuclear war and terrorism. It seems very much a non-sequitur, and adds nothing to the book to my mind.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
215,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779701-robyn,2,"Disappointing pop science. I learned about Snow's mapping of London's cholera epidemic in my graduate stats class and hoped this book would delve deeper into the process of its creation and lasting impact on public health and statistics (and help in my quest to better understand math and science, after brushing both (especially the latter) aside in favor of the humanities and social sciences). Unfortunately, the book dragged out over 200-plus pages the initial article I had read in class. It was notable that the tale focused on not only the celebrated Snow, but the until recently obscured local pastor, Whitehead, who really did the fieldwork that backed up Snow's waterborne theory. Only recommended to those who've never encountered this story in another format (and who won't wince at detailed descriptions of cholera symptoms). "

(Global warming hysteria comes to my mind, but certainly not the author's.) Unfortunately, the author completely drops the ball with the ending. The book suddenly turns to molasses, and it appears he didn't know how to end it. After reading the end notes, I got the impression that he grafted his undergraduate thesis into the ending. He also goes off on some wild tangents (nuclear weapons elimination!) at the very end in essentially a double-I-just-can't-end the book ending. Could have been 4 or 5 stars if he had kept up the pace he started with, but bizarrely it just crumbles at the end."

When a cholera outbreak strikes a London neighborhood in 1854, Dr. John Snow sets out to gather proof for his theory that the disease is caused by drinking contaminated water, and not by miasma (foul air), which was the popular theory of the time. He famously drew a map showing the location of the victims and the locations of the neighborhood water pumps.The subject is very interesting and the book is well written, but the author meanders quite a bit and is repetitive at times.

Also there were a lot of weirdly privileged arguments...e.g. ""poor people and rich people live in cities for exactly the same reason...because that's where the action is."" Nope.

When a massive cholera epidemic hit London in 1854, a group of researchers tried to understand what caused the disease and how to stop it.This was a very interesting study of the deductive and inductive processes that led to the new understanding of the critical importance of better sanitation."

Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it.

238,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"
239,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46509180-lori,4,"Mind blown! The story took a bit to get going and there are definitely some dry parts. But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol. And many years ago, fewer people could do this. With humans moving from rural to urban centres we created some waste related issues for ourselves. The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
240,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10664133-nicola,5,"If you have a strong enough stomach to tolerate graphic descriptions of the state of sanitation in Victorian London, and you have an interest in epidemiology, this book is for you. It's fascinating! I will never look at a glass of water the same way again! Some other reviewers comment that this book meanders away from the main narrative describing the outbreak of cholera in London in 1854. The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine. "
241,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,4,"More like a 3.5. I greatly enjoyed this, though I can see the subject matter would be potentially super dry for some. I find the practicalities of 19th Century urbanisation amid the Industrial Revolution very interesting, particularly in London. Gives extra depth to anyone who spends time reading Dickens or other fiction taking place at that time. Also anyone interested in GIS applications for medical information, how maps and topography are used to track epidemics, would find these early days super interesting. In the last chapter he touches on the way technology has changed the scale of disease tracking now that we have Google maps and geotagging, etc.Overall an interesting slice of history. And because they spent so much time talking about Soho and street names and maps, I looked up Snow's Cholera map to compare it with a modern map on Google well before I go to the end of the book. Putting street view onto the corner where the pump was located was a neat surprise, to see the name of the pub there."

It all started with one microorganism...It was capable to kill thousands of people. Learn about London’s most dreadful epidemic. It made me feel so nervous and suspicious, because of that mysterious origin of the bacteria… This novel truly uncovered for me the importance of interdependece and the life order the earth depends on. This novel uncovered for me that competition in scientific world can help and motivate people greatly. Three different scientists using such various methods to trace the virus led them to unite at one point their discoveries for one final step: discovering the origin causing such dreadful consequences. ONCE PASSION AND MOTIVATION UNITE THE CREATION OF RESOLUTION IS NEAR..... Read this novel to find out if the timing was just right, if the epidemic spread was fatal or stopped..... "

It turned out that I knew the legend rather than the facts. This book is certainly packed with facts; however they are presented in such a clear attractive fashion,that it reads as easily as fiction. I heartily recommend this book. It is not just a book about an epidemic. It has a great deal to say about cities as machines for sustaining commerce, culture, employment and leisure. The Victorians had developed the machine, but lacked a trouble shooter's manual. They faced a deadly glitch in the form of a cholera epidemic in the time before antibiotics, public sanitation departments or even the knowledge of the germ method of contagion. It caused me to reflect on the complexity and vulnerability of our modern metropolises and to wonder where the next glitch may appear."
244,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a really good account of the outbreak of cholera that led to John Snow’s famous map, showing that a particular water pump was the culprit. He traces the history of how London dealt with sewage and how it became such a big issue, and also examines some of the main characters in the drama of trying to stop the outbreak — and trying to challenge miasma theory, which was so much the paradigm at the time. There isn’t a lot of specific science stuff here, but Johnson makes clear why the cholera pathogen is so deadly in a very accessible way.The only weird part is in the conclusion/afterword to the book, where Johnson talks more generally about the risks to city life and starts discussing nuclear war and terrorism. It seems very much a non-sequitur, and adds nothing to the book to my mind.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
245,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779701-robyn,2,"Disappointing pop science. I learned about Snow's mapping of London's cholera epidemic in my graduate stats class and hoped this book would delve deeper into the process of its creation and lasting impact on public health and statistics (and help in my quest to better understand math and science, after brushing both (especially the latter) aside in favor of the humanities and social sciences). Unfortunately, the book dragged out over 200-plus pages the initial article I had read in class. It was notable that the tale focused on not only the celebrated Snow, but the until recently obscured local pastor, Whitehead, who really did the fieldwork that backed up Snow's waterborne theory. Only recommended to those who've never encountered this story in another format (and who won't wince at detailed descriptions of cholera symptoms). "

(Global warming hysteria comes to my mind, but certainly not the author's.) Unfortunately, the author completely drops the ball with the ending. The book suddenly turns to molasses, and it appears he didn't know how to end it. After reading the end notes, I got the impression that he grafted his undergraduate thesis into the ending. He also goes off on some wild tangents (nuclear weapons elimination!) at the very end in essentially a double-I-just-can't-end the book ending. Could have been 4 or 5 stars if he had kept up the pace he started with, but bizarrely it just crumbles at the end."

When a cholera outbreak strikes a London neighborhood in 1854, Dr. John Snow sets out to gather proof for his theory that the disease is caused by drinking contaminated water, and not by miasma (foul air), which was the popular theory of the time. He famously drew a map showing the location of the victims and the locations of the neighborhood water pumps.The subject is very interesting and the book is well written, but the author meanders quite a bit and is repetitive at times.

But the changing of science/cities/the modern world? Nope. Getting kind of sick of these pseudo-historians trying to be all ""X made the whole world different."" Also there were a lot of weirdly privileged arguments...e.g. ""poor people and rich people live in cities for exactly the same reason...because that's where the action is."" Nope.

When a massive cholera epidemic hit London in 1854, a group of researchers tried to understand what caused the disease and how to stop it.This was a very interesting study of the deductive and inductive processes that led to the new understanding of the critical importance of better sanitation."

264,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"Talk about a timely read. This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
265,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative. In addition, the lack of Snow’s maps and analysis, especially the key Voronoi one, seemed an important oversight. Overall, an okay read about an interesting case."

The more concentrated the human population, the dirtier our water supplies became, the greater chance of water born diseases. Hence people that could digest alcohol had a higher probability of living through microbial disease and procreate. Whereas the ones that couldn’t digest alcohol, stuck with water and didn’t live long enough to procreate. This in turn bottlenecked our Caucasian genetics to be able to tolerate alcohol easily. And here was my ah-ha moment. A historical culture that didn’t urbanize and bottleneck their genetics was the indigenous cultures of Australia and North America. These cultures are well known in today’s culture for their issues with alcohol. And Johnson theorizes that their rural hunting and gathering not only preventing them from developing immunity to many urban diseases but may have contributed to their genetic issues with alcohol. A very thought provoking theory. I really enjoyed the journey Snow and Whitehead went through to figure out the problem of cholera. It was also interesting to see the coincidences that prevented cholera from doing even more damage.I’m sure this book isn’t for everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

It's fascinating! I will never look at a glass of water the same way again! Some other reviewers comment that this book meanders away from the main narrative describing the outbreak of cholera in London in 1854. The book talks about the detective work of Dr. John Snow who ultimately traced the outbreak to a local water supply using careful data collection and rudimentary disease mapping to advance his unpopular theory on the spread of the disease which went against the existing, accepted medical paradigm. Perhaps, because I listened to the audiobook, the meandering philosophical discussion of the implications of the case did not bog me down as it would have if I was reading. Instead, it seemed like reasonable elaboration on a topic with far-reaching relevance, especially to topics such as population growth, urbanization, public health,epidemiology and statistics in medicine. "
271,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,4,"More like a 3.5. I greatly enjoyed this, though I can see the subject matter would be potentially super dry for some. I find the practicalities of 19th Century urbanisation amid the Industrial Revolution very interesting, particularly in London. Gives extra depth to anyone who spends time reading Dickens or other fiction taking place at that time. Also anyone interested in GIS applications for medical information, how maps and topography are used to track epidemics, would find these early days super interesting. In the last chapter he touches on the way technology has changed the scale of disease tracking now that we have Google maps and geotagging, etc.Overall an interesting slice of history. And because they spent so much time talking about Soho and street names and maps, I looked up Snow's Cholera map to compare it with a modern map on Google well before I go to the end of the book. Putting street view onto the corner where the pump was located was a neat surprise, to see the name of the pub there."

It all started with one microorganism...It was capable to kill thousands of people. Learn about London’s most dreadful epidemic. It made me feel so nervous and suspicious, because of that mysterious origin of the bacteria… This novel truly uncovered for me the importance of interdependece and the life order the earth depends on. This novel uncovered for me that competition in scientific world can help and motivate people greatly. Three different scientists using such various methods to trace the virus led them to unite at one point their discoveries for one final step: discovering the origin causing such dreadful consequences. ONCE PASSION AND MOTIVATION UNITE THE CREATION OF RESOLUTION IS NEAR..... Read this novel to find out if the timing was just right, if the epidemic spread was fatal or stopped..... "

It turned out that I knew the legend rather than the facts. This book is certainly packed with facts; however they are presented in such a clear attractive fashion,that it reads as easily as fiction. I heartily recommend this book. It is not just a book about an epidemic. It has a great deal to say about cities as machines for sustaining commerce, culture, employment and leisure. The Victorians had developed the machine, but lacked a trouble shooter's manual. They faced a deadly glitch in the form of a cholera epidemic in the time before antibiotics, public sanitation departments or even the knowledge of the germ method of contagion. It caused me to reflect on the complexity and vulnerability of our modern metropolises and to wonder where the next glitch may appear."
274,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a really good account of the outbreak of cholera that led to John Snow’s famous map, showing that a particular water pump was the culprit. He traces the history of how London dealt with sewage and how it became such a big issue, and also examines some of the main characters in the drama of trying to stop the outbreak — and trying to challenge miasma theory, which was so much the paradigm at the time. There isn’t a lot of specific science stuff here, but Johnson makes clear why the cholera pathogen is so deadly in a very accessible way.The only weird part is in the conclusion/afterword to the book, where Johnson talks more generally about the risks to city life and starts discussing nuclear war and terrorism. It seems very much a non-sequitur, and adds nothing to the book to my mind.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
275,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779701-robyn,2,"Disappointing pop science. I learned about Snow's mapping of London's cholera epidemic in my graduate stats class and hoped this book would delve deeper into the process of its creation and lasting impact on public health and statistics (and help in my quest to better understand math and science, after brushing both (especially the latter) aside in favor of the humanities and social sciences). Unfortunately, the book dragged out over 200-plus pages the initial article I had read in class. It was notable that the tale focused on not only the celebrated Snow, but the until recently obscured local pastor, Whitehead, who really did the fieldwork that backed up Snow's waterborne theory. Only recommended to those who've never encountered this story in another format (and who won't wince at detailed descriptions of cholera symptoms). "

(Global warming hysteria comes to my mind, but certainly not the author's.) Unfortunately, the author completely drops the ball with the ending. The book suddenly turns to molasses, and it appears he didn't know how to end it. After reading the end notes, I got the impression that he grafted his undergraduate thesis into the ending. He also goes off on some wild tangents (nuclear weapons elimination!) at the very end in essentially a double-I-just-can't-end the book ending. Could have been 4 or 5 stars if he had kept up the pace he started with, but bizarrely it just crumbles at the end."

He famously drew a map showing the location of the victims and the locations of the neighborhood water pumps.The subject is very interesting and the book is well written, but the author meanders quite a bit and is repetitive at times. Towards the end he branches out to discuss the benefits and risks of urban density."

I enjoyed the details about the cholera epidemic and felt like Johnson's narrative style made it much more interesting than it actually was (or than the available evidence allows). But the changing of science/cities/the modern world? Nope. Getting kind of sick of these pseudo-historians trying to be all ""X made the whole world different."" Also there were a lot of weirdly privileged arguments...e.g. ""poor people and rich people live in cities for exactly the same reason...because that's where the action is."" Nope.

This book paints a vivid picture of the sanitary conditions of the time, and gives an overview of the awful impact of cholera, a disease that (we now know) is typically transmitted in contaminated water. When a massive cholera epidemic hit London in 1854, a group of researchers tried to understand what caused the disease and how to stop it.This was a very interesting study of the deductive and inductive processes that led to the new understanding of the critical importance of better sanitation."

283,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657208-marta,4,I have some mixed feelings on this book in the end. Mostly this comes from the last 50 pages or so where the author relates the cholera outbreak and city growth and development to our modern age. It gave me plenty to think about and a good reading list for the future. I was disappointed that he propagated the myth of the Chicag0 1885 cholera epidemic. That's easy research that should have been done.

294,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"Talk about a timely read. This is something I picked up used before the current disaster, and I remember thinking it was of some interest but more of as an historical artifact. The book deals in some detail, although not overwhelming, with an 1854 cholera outbreak in London and the efforts to figure out what caused it. Cholera of course was well known in that era around the world and caused numerous epidemics, including as recently as 2016-2020 in Yemen. But the prevailing belief (quasi-scientific) in the 1850s and before was that it was caused by 'miasma', i.e. bad air. That notion was hard to shake amongst the cognoscenti of the time. But Dr. John Snow, a name I had not heard before, came up with the theory on the waterborne nature of cholera. He did not even know what in the water would have caused it, turned out to be a bacterium called vibrio cholerae (which actually had been identified by an Italian anatomist around the same time, but that was unknown to Snow). Of course, he was ridiculed despite already being a highly respected physician who was a pioneer in the use of anesthesia. His intense research and close partnership with Rev. Henry Whitehead on the sociological aspects of the epidemic were ground-breaking for the time. And his map of the outbreak (hence the name of book) which he used to illustrate the relationship between contaminated water sources and fatalities became dare I say, a watershed in the use of cartography for epidemiological analysis. From this to the Johns Hopkins site being used for Covid-19. The book written in 2006 is also a paean to the virtues of city living. The solution of the cholera mystery made modern large cities possible, today on a scale unimaginable in the 1850s. And parts of the book are almost an urban worship-fest. Only cities can save us from ourselves, he opines. But in his final chapters on coming epidemics and pandemics he clearly recognizes the threat that has arrived on our doorsteps today. He discusses H5N1 ('bird flu') and the threat it posed back in 2006 but noted the lack of easy transmission from human to human. Well, obviously COVID-19 ('bat flu' or 'lab flu'?) does not follow those ancient rules and suddenly cities look vulnerable again. "
295,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"The Ghost Map tells the story of how Dr John Snow, a London physician, solved the problem of how to tackle Cholera. Johnson starts his historical tale by setting the scene and in particular detailing the filth and stench of the city and the various professions who cleaned and recycled the city’s waste. In the absence of sewers and formalized waste management, human and animal faeces littered streets and basements. It was the foul-smelling stench – the miasma – of such waste that was thought to spread disease. Snow, however, had a different theory – disease was spread via contaminated water – and most of the book concerns Snow’s work. In particular, the narrative focuses on the 1854 cholera epidemic, its catastrophic outcome on a local community, how by plotting ghosts on a map Snow identified the source of the outbreak, changing both the practice of epidemiology and public infrastructure and public health provision of modern cities globally. It’s an interesting tale, but it is a little uneven in its telling, with an overextended focus on some elements that drifted into repetition, and underdeveloped on others, particularly the public health situation and response, and the evolution of thinking and practice in the years proceeding Snow’s work. And the final chapter on the spread of disease and viruses in the present day, as well as urban development, was a potted attempt to convert the lesson from the nineteenth century to the present that felt like an add-on and speculative. In addition, the lack of Snow’s maps and analysis, especially the key Voronoi one, seemed an important oversight. Overall, an okay read about an interesting case."
296,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"It’s the mid-19th century and London is a city. Almost miraculously, a group of people have organised themselves into a class of scavengers, taking on the responsibility of most modern sanitation departments and thus helping two million people get rid of their waste. However, this effort does have some cracks and not all waste is gotten rid of. One particular household’s waste, in particular, is thrown out and lands near a certain pump.The Ghost Map is an account of the John Snow and to a lesser extent, Henry Whitehead’s investigations into a series of chlorea cases (the 1854 Broad Street Chlorea Outbreak) that led to the discovery of a contaminated pump and the dismantling of the miasma theory.Told in seven chapters, each one representing a day, The Ghost Map presents a detailed and sometimes wandering account of how John Snow conducted his investigations. Through this account, the book manages to give the reader a general introduction to who John Snow is, including his work with anaesthesia, as well as why the discovery of water contamination and its relationship to cholera was so important for cities to continue growing without large numbers of deaths.To be honest, the book felt rather longwinded in parts, especially since it has the tendency to digress to other topics (about miasma theory, especially). But I generally enjoyed reading this book. It was heavy, particularly in the current climate, but I think the fact that the cause of transmission of the cholera outbreak could be discovered and stopped gives hope that we can stop future outbreaks of diseases if we approach the situation with an open mind.Overall, I enjoyed it. It’s not the most gripping nonfiction history book that I’ve read but history buffs may be interested in exploring this aspect of medical history.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"

But I'm STRONGER now and I finally read it! 💪I am very glad I read this as an audiobook because it would've been much harder for me to get through otherwise. I'm personally drawn to many things at once and would have probably put this down in favor of something else because it's dense with information and while well-researched and interesting, it's not exactly so riveting, I'd drop everything else. But I wanted to read this now and understand how it might relate to what's happening in the world today, especially in high-population cities.I didn't understand why so many ""experts"" at the time didn't take to theories of mass infection by ingesting water from the same location rather than ""because it smells so bad."" 😒 I do, however, know that what we consider common sense today was built by people who had to sway public opinions with what, at the time, was groundbreaking leaps in logic. ""The virus that causes such international panic does not exist yet"" 👀""Some experts think a pandemic on the order of 1918 is a near inevitability"" 👀👀""But we'll have the tools at our disposal to deal with the emerging threats if we're smart enough to deploy them."" 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀It's a whole different animal to have a virus passed from human to human so easily and carelessly compared to diseases that arose from poor living conditions and a lack of sanitary resources. Both nightmares, both harbingers of mass death, both serving as catalysts for advancement in vaccine medicine and genetic composition analysis."
298,1594489254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752024-kelly,5,"I am not entirely sure how I ended up reading a book about a 19th century cholera epidemic. It must have been recommended to me because I like Victorian mysteries. But I actually found it to be fascinating. Don't start this book over dinner, it's a bit stomach-turning. Lots of discussion of poop and nasty cholera symptoms (yikes). But stick with it, the fun science starts a few chapters in.At the time, everyone thought diseases were caused by ""miasmas"" which as the author explains was kind of understandable because cities smelled terrible at the time, and we are naturally inclined to feel sick when we smell poop, decay, etc. People also did not fully understand the difference between a virus, which can be spread by airborne methods, and a bacterial infection, which generally can not.Dr John Snow therefore had to work overtime to build a procedural case for cholera being a waterborne disease to present to authorities. He did it through a combination of scientific observation and sociological study, using a now-famous map to trace the spread of the disease. In the end, the handle was removed from the famous Broad Street pump which had been the vector for the particularly virulent strain of cholera that wiped out much of Soho. His evidence contributed to the development of the London sewer system, a massive engineering project that was way ahead of its time, and set the pattern for modern urban sanitation systems. The book finishes up with a discussion of how these systems basically make civilization sustainable on the planet because dense cities are the most efficient and sustainable way for people to live (if they have proper plumbing, clearly!)So, now I guess I'm going to have find a book about the guy who built the London sewers!"

But wow was it packed with fascinating information. We can now look down our noses at the ignorance of our forefathers trying to cure illness and disease with poultices and castor oil and smoke. But what will our great great great grandchildren say about our “advanced medical knowledge” today? We do the best we can with what we’ve got, just like every human civilization has done. My ah-ha moment was right near the middle. Of course we now know that cholera was spread by London’s water supply in 1853. But they didn’t then. And many people tried to figure it out with logic and experiment. A lot of amazing scientific hero’s stayed in London’s Broad Street even though staying might mean certain death. Many people in that time drank water. But things were changing. Many of our forefathers survived because they chose alcohol over water. It was better to die from cirrhosis of the liver at 40 than microbial diseases at 20. In order to tolerate alcohol our bodies need to produce the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) from chromosome 4. Not everyone has the genetics to digest alcohol.
