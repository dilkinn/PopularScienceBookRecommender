0,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3114042-jessica,2,"This book tries too hard to be Freakonomics. The first two parts are full of random examples of interesting but mostly pointless things that can learned via Google search trends. However, a whole lot of assumptions are made off these bits of data that don't seem to have much basis in factual scientific methods of research. Unprofessional jokes are thrown in randomly. If you need a footnote to explain why a joke was not homophobic maybe you should have just skipped the joke. And any book of less than 300 pages of text should not need to use the same example three times, especially when it's about how the author can't believe women are concerned about the smell of their vagina.The last section of the book explains the limitations big data holds and is really the most grounded section, the rest being almost hagiography. It would have done a lot to work the third section into the examples of the first two sections. It would have balanced out the praise and also would have done much to explain the flaws present in some of the examples included.Some cool facts buried in a lot of murky oddness.Disclaimer: I was given this book in a Goodreads giveaway."

…people’s search for information is, in itself, information. When and where they search for facts, quotes, jokes, places, persons, things, or help, it turns out, can tell us a lot more about what they really think, really desire, really fear, and really do than anyone might have guessed. This is especially true since people sometimes don’t so much query Google as confide in it: “I hate my boss.” “I am drunk.” “My dad hit me.”
There’s lies, damned lies and then there are statistics. One must wonder. Do the lies get bigger as the datasets grow? Seth Stephens-Davidowitz posits that the availability of vast sums of new data not only allows researchers to make better predictions, but offers them never-before-available tools that can offer insight that direct questioning never could. We have seen steps up of this type before. Malcolm Gladwell has made a career of such, with Blink, Outliers, and The Tipping Point. Freakonomics is the one I would expect most folks would know. Nate Silver put his data expertise into The Signal and the Noise. All these looks at data and how we interpret it rely on the analyst, regardless, pretty much, of the data. While the same might be true of Stephens-Davidowitz’s approach, he focuses on the availability of materials that have not been there in the past. The smarts that must be applied to get the most interesting results can now be applied to new oceans of data. It is more possible than it has ever been to draw inferences and actually test them out. In addition to the volume of data that is now available, there is the sort. The author looks at Google and FB data for evidence of underlying realities. Surveys can sometimes offer inaccurate outcomes, when the people being queried do not provide honest answers. Are you a racist? Yes/No. But one can look at what people enter into Google to get a sense of possible racism by geographic area. The everyday act of typing a word or phrase into a compact rectangular white box leaves a small trace of truth that, when multiplied by millions, eventually reveals profound realities. Looking for queries on jokes involving the N-Word, for example, turns out to yield a telling portrait of anti-black sentiment, which also correlates with lower black life expectancy. (And pro-Trump vote totals) We are treated to looks into a variety of research subjects, from picking the ponies, to seeing what really interests/concerns people sexually, looking for patterns of child abuse, selecting the best wine, using the texts of a vast number of books and movie scripts to come up with six simple plot structures.I thought the most interesting piece was on the use of associations, and provoking curiosity, rather than relying on overt statements to influence how people feel about a different group of people. Another was on using a data comparison of one’s (anonymous) medical information to others who share many characteristics to improve medical diagnoses.There are some areas in which it was not entirely persuasive that the methodology in question was tracking what was claimed. SS-D sees in searches of Pornhub, for example,  what people really want and really do, not what they say they want and say they do. Really? I expect that what people check out on-line does not necessarily track with what might be of interest in real life. It would be like someone with an interest in mysteries being thought to have homicidal tendencies after searching for a variety of homicide related titles. Should a writer doing research into a dark subject like child pornography, human trafficking or cannibalism expect the heavy knock of the police on his/her door? Where is the line between an academic or titillation search and one made for planning?SS-D makes a point about there being a significant difference between searches that offer projections for groups or areas, and their inapplicability for predicting individual behavior, although that will not necessarily remain the case. In baseball, for example, the explosion of available information may very well be applied to specific players to diagnose and even correct flaws in technique, or recognize patterns that might expose underlying medical issues, or predict their arrival. The Big Data related here is much more macro, looking at group proclivities. Useful for spotting trends, measuring public sentiment, but in more detail than has been heretofore possible.And of course there is the impact of dark players. Those with the resources and motivation could manipulate the Big Data produced by Google and Facebook. Such players would not necessarily be limited to Russian cyber-spies and pranksters, but corporate and ideological players as well, like  Robert Mercer. There could have been a bit more in here on those concerns.The book offers plenty of anecdotal bits that could have been lifted from any of the other data books noted at the top of this review. What one needs, ultimately is smart, insightful analysis. Having all the data in the world (that means you, NSA) is merely a burden unless there is someone insightful enough to figure out the right questions to ask, and how to ask them.SS-D notes several Google (Trends, Ngrams, Correlate) services that might be familiar to folks doing actual research, but which were news to me. It might be useful to check out some of these, maybe even come up with meaningful queries to shed light on pressing, or even completely frivolous questions.Not all problems can be solved, or even examined by the addition of ever more data. Sometimes, many times, the information that is available is perfectly sufficient to the task, but other factors prevent the joining together of its various pieces to create a meaningful whole. The now classic example is from 9/11, when an absence of coordination between the CIA and FBI resulted in suicide bombers who could have been foiled succeeding in their mission. Politics and the culture of nations and organizations figure into how data is usedSo if everybody lies, is Seth Stephens-Davidowitz telling us the truth? I am sure there is a query one could construct that would look at diverse data sources, pull them all together and give us a fuller picture, but for now, we will have to make do with reading his book and articles, checking out his videos, applying the analytical tools already incorporated into our brains, and seeing if there is enough information there with which to come to a well-grounded conclusion. And that’s no lie.

When sociologist survey the contents of the same people's garbage, they get a more accurate answer.Just imagine how much more information is available trolling through internet searches."
3,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an engaging book about how big data can be used to improve our understanding of human behavior, thinking, emotions, and preference. The basic idea is that if you ask people about their behavior or their preferences in surveys, even anonymous surveys, they will often lie. People do not like to admit to low-brow preferences; racists do not want to admit to their prejudices, most people who watch pornography do not want to admit to it, and even voting is often misrepresented; some people who voted for Trump would not admit to it. But, by analyzing immense datasets from Google, public archives, social media, and the like, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz has been able to unearth a lot of fascinating answers to puzzling questions. For example, he is able to predict, through Google searches for various symptoms, who is likely to have early stages of pancreatic cancer. He can predict epidemic breakouts of some contagious diseases well before they are announced by the CDC (Center for Disease Control). He shows that the single factor that correlates with voting for Trump is that of racism.Then there are the fun factoids, about the sorts of things that people search for most often on Google. Most commonly, the search ""Is my son ..."" is followed by ""gifted"", while the search ""Is my daughter ..."" is followed by ""overweight"". That tells us something about stereotypes for the way people think about their children. Interestingly, the release of a new violent movie in a city is correlated with a decrease in violent crime in that city. Perhaps the reason is that violent people who are watching the movie are not out on the streets, committing crimes.And here we get to the main problem with this sort of analysis. Undoubtedly, the research and analysis of big datasets is done correctly. However, once a surprising result is found, understanding the motivations behind the online activity are often subjective and open to interpretation. While this book is very careful about its underlying assumptions, it is a slippery road to getting the correct interpretations and explanations.This is an easy, well-paced book that should appeal to anybody who enjoys books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything."

6,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"Everybody Lies has all the makings of the kind of book I get suckered into buying during an amazon kindle sale. A pop culture polemic that has a very short half-life of relevancy. After reading it, my first blush was to say that I was spot on. But as I thought about it, I realized it had more depth. That's likely because Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is an actual scientist trying to educate people about what they are actually revealing with everything that they say and do. The late 20th Century has heralded access to vast quantities of information on every one of us. Our buying habits, browsing habits, what news sources that we use in a very proliferated world of news access. We are telling about ourselves every time we go online on our tablets, phones and computers. Every text, every phone call, every e-mail is adding data to our digital make up. Like it or not, data is collected and available for each and every one of us on some very personal things. There is a field of science dedicated to analyzing the data and interpreting its meaning. The byproducts of this new field are used for good and evil. Corporations can use the information to target people who may buy their items (How did goodreads know that I was thinking about buying a mattress?). Some data mining results could be used to determine how much people need certain types of government services. Some internet searches combined with buying habits, forum discussions, book reviews, blog posts etc have led to medical discoveries. The amount of data is staggering and the ability to compile and analyze the data to reveal useful information is a new science that goes way beyond statistics. It requires knowledge of math, and sociology and psychology and engineering and biological science and an understanding of human nature etc to attempt to mine useful information. What Stephens-Davidowitz has discovered is that everybody lies about…well everything. His primary discussion is that people rarely tell the truth in poll and surveys etc. They also lie on their online data habits. Oftentimes to themselves. That little fact obviously complicates the mining of data for example in Red States w/ their stated evangelical postures that consume the most porn and have the highest rates of internet searches for access to abortions etc. People lie in their own searches as they seek to reinforce their own positions and don't necessarily search for answers. Those kinds of actions are not surprising but they complicate analysis (understatement). This book was very interesting data primer. There is so much more to the amount of data most of us generate every day and Stephens-Davidowitz does a great job of explaining the basics. Some of his examples and his approach are a bit superficial, juvenile, pop culture. I don't find myself curious about the users of pornhub, or average penis size or baseball stats. Some of that was silly and salacious; betraying his youth and blatantly catering to what his data mining perceived would be an audience of young males. Bah. Also, he quoted Malcolm Gladwell as a resource which in my view should never be used if you hope to build a foundation based upon experience in the field and credibility on the subject…of anything. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book and I think Stephens-Davidowitz has a very compelling and prosperous future as both a scientist and a writer. 4 StarsRead on kindle"
7,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849990-carole,4,"Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Reveals About Who We Really Are by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz takes us into the world of social sciences via the internet. I might have found the book version a bit on the boring side but I enjoyed the audiobook. Big Data can answer any and all of our questions. But will the answer be what we want to hear. And do we need to know about all aspects of the world we live in. The book is similar to some of Malcolm Gladwell's work but it is not Malcolm Gladwell. However, you will be informed, you will learn about our world and you will sometimes be amused. "
8,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important data set ever collected on the human psyche. writes the author early on & he shows why. (Google trends is available to all here: https://trends.google.com/trends/) He also checked other big data sets including Wikipedia, Facebook, Pornhub, & even Stormfront, the largest racist site. What he found was really interesting & it will help harden the soft, social sciences. It's a new frontier. He points out problems with traditional reporting. In the section about child abuse & abortions, Google searches suggest that child abuse does increase during economic downturns while gov't figures incorrectly show little change. Closing abortion clinics doesn't stop them, it simply leads to more self-induced abortions. Both happen off the books, but there is now convincing supporting data to show us what we need to address & make more informed decisions with resources.Big data has an advantage over every other type of survey because few realize it is being collected, so we don't lie to make ourselves look better. It's also anonymous & aggregate, so caution needs to be used when forming conclusions. For instance, based on Pornhub searches, the author concludes that about 5% of men are gay because they searched for gay porn. That seemed a reasonable conclusion until he pointed out that 15% of women search for rape porn. Does that mean they want to be raped? The author says of course not & makes a big deal out of the difference between fantasy & reality. That makes me question his first conclusion, although it seems about right.Gut reactions are often wrong & he provides several examples where it's wrong due to cognitive biases. He also points out ""The Curse of Dimensionality"". Given large enough sets of data, there will be correlations just through chance. For instance, there are graphs that show how closely autism diagnoses track with organic food sales or Jenny McCarthy's popularity. Separating these out is a whole other problem.Big Data only gives us trends that we need to examine. We can't use it on the individual level. While 1000 people searched for how to kill their girl friend, only 1 girl was killed in his example. That's horrific & might have been stopped if someone had looked at his search history, but do we give up everyone's privacy for a 1 in 1000 chance that we might prevent a murder? Some might be willing, but I'm not, so we also have new questions to address.The audio book was well narrated & I didn't miss the graphs too much. They're provided in the extra material, but weren't handy when I was listening & the book took that into account for the most part. Highly recommended in either format."
9,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,3,"Maybe everyone does lie. But they don’t lie all the time. Stephens-Davidowitz makes the good point that asking people directly doesn’t always, in fact may not often, yield true answers. People have their own reasons for answering pollsters untruthfully, but it is clear that this is a documented fact. People sometimes lie to pollsters.Stephens-Davidowitz was told by mentors and advisors not to consider Google searches worthwhile data, but the more he looked at it, the more he was convinced that Google searches contained the best data for determining what people are concerned about. He has uncovered some interesting trends that are not apparent through direct questioning because people are sometimes ashamed of their fears, feelings, prejudices, and predilections.♾I didn’t really like this book. Partly the reason is because I listened to it, and Stephens-Davidowitz gives charts, graphs, data points that obviously cannot be represented in the audio version. These usually help me to grasp things easily and maybe bypass pages of material that is not as interesting to me. It wasn’t that his material was hard, it was that I oftentimes did not like what he was talking about. He had a tendency to focus on deviant behavior, e.g., sexual predators, abuse, porn, etc. One might make the argument that these behaviors are important to understand and therefore worth looking at. Possibly. However, if ‘everybody lies,’ one might make the argument that we do not have to look at deviance to find untruthfulness.What we discover is that to test Stephens-Davidowitz’s thesis that ‘everybody lies,’ we have to spend quite a lot of time with statistics and creating studies, or as he is wont to do, studying big data. Big data probably irons out discrepancies in the reasons for our Google searches, e.g., that it is not me that is interested in the herpes virus, it is my brother, because in the end it doesn’t matter why we did the search; what matters is that we did the search. Besides, maybe I’m lying about my brother having the virus, but my interest in the topic is not a lie.Stephens-Davidowitz has made a career so far out of the study of big data, showing us ways to slice and dice it so that it is useful to our view of the world. Only thing is, I am not as interested in what big data tells us as he is. He’d trained as an economist, and towards the end of the book he hit a couple of areas I did find more interesting, like the notion of regression discontinuity, a term used to describe a statistical tool created to measure the outcomes of people very close to some arbitrary cut-off.** S-D talks about using this tool on federal inmates, discovering criminals treated more harshly committed more crimes upon their release. But S-D also studied students on either side of the admissions cut-off for the prestigious Stuyvesant High School: those who attended Stuyvesant did not have a significant performance difference in later life than students who did not. Apparently Stephens-Davidowitz went into data science because of Freakonomics, the bestselling book by Steven D. Levitt. He believes that many of the next generation of scientists in every field will be data scientists. I did finish the audiobook, another study he took note of in the last pages. Apparently few readers finish ‘treatises’ by economists. He believes this is his big contribution to our knowledge base, and there is no doubt his contrariness did highlight ways big data can be used effectively.If I may be so bold, I might be able to suggest a reason why many female readers may not be as interested in the material presented, or in Stephens-Davidowitz himself (he was/is apparently looking for a girlfriend). Stay away from the deviant sex stuff, Seth. It may interest you but I can guarantee that fewer women are going to find that appealing or reassuring conversation or reading material. An interesting corollary to this economists’ data view is the question of whether the truth matters, which is how I came to pick up this book. Recently on PBS’ The Third Rail with Ozy, Carlos Watson asked whether the truth matters. At first blush the answer seems obvious, and two sides debated this question. One side said of course truth matters…but most of us know one man’s truth to be another man’s lie. The other side said ‘everybody lies.’ It got me to thinking…I do think the two ways of coming to the notion of lying dovetail at some point, and one has to conclude that truth may not matter as much as we think. What matters is what we believe to be true.Finally, it appears Stephens-Davidson agrees to some degree with Cathy O'Neill, author of Weapons of Math Destruction, in that he agrees you best not let algorithms run without human tweaking and interference. The best outcomes are delivered when humans apply their particular observations and knowledge and expertise along with big data.** S-D describes it this way:  “Any time there is precise number that divides people into two different groups, a discontinuity, economists can compare, or regress, the outcomes of people very very close to the cut off.”"
10,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39090236-amos,1,"No practicing analyst or social scientist will find anything of value in this book. It verges on being dangerously deceptive, filled with logical fallacies and half baked reasoning for it's conclusions. The book claims to be finding truth in an uncertain world, but actually is just adding to the noise."
11,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"This book could have used a good editor. It tries to be a Gladwell-type of book without fully succeeding. Issue 1 is that the anecdotal stories are not fleshed out enough to really draw you in like Gladwell does. This causes much of the book to come across as a list of facts, and it gets pretty old by the midway point.The other issue is a growing trend among people writing data books. They want to write in a colloquial style to make it seem informal and easy to read. They don't want to scare off people with talk of algorithms and things like that. Unfortunately, using tons of sentence fragments and colloquial phrases only makes a book like this harder to read. It's precision and clarity that make books easy to understand. Introducing ambiguity in order to sound like a friendly conversation is exactly the wrong approach.Overall, there are a bunch of interesting facts in here. I think Seth gets a bunch wrong, though, in not understanding fully why certain search terms are used."
12,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"I was annoyed by the author’s writing style in ‘Everybody Lies’. I have no doubts author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz was trying to write to a large general audience, including that assumed class of American non-science reader who hates math and binge watches ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’. Good for him, and maybe you, right? But I became more and more annoyed as I read. Ah, well. It is an interesting and informative read, in spite of trying too hard to be fun, imho.What is the book about? I am glad to report it has genuine information about the science of statistics and ‘big data’ collecting, and how the erroneous selection of study parameters or assumptions about what is relevant data to study affects conclusions (as far as I know - I am a dunce at scientific math, despite that I passed a statistics class). The author used what seemed to me genuinely interesting new methods to formulate statistical studies, primarily using Google’s forensic tools, along with other sources. I was shocked by what people type into Google Search (which Google compiles into anonymous data). For example, President Obama’s race appears to have truly ignited racists into coming out of their closets. Comparing survey interviews with people who state they are racist (a low percentage) with the percentage of those who Googled “n***** jokes” state by state turns out to show some truly hidden pockets of unexpected racism - and the total percentage of racist searches on Google was WAY higher than the racism that typical surveys show. In addition, those places who adore Trump also searched most for “n***** jokes”. Correlation? Idk, no one does know for the record, but I think yes.Also of interest to me (please don’t bust my balls because of my prurient interests - and maybe there is a pun in this sentence, hehheh - read on) men really truly do Google a lot about penis sizes. Come on, fellas, give it a rest! (Yes, I am trying to be snarky since the too much ‘at rest’ position is part of what men appear to be most anxious about!) Men prowl porn sites in humongous numbers - shocking, right? - which is good for statisticians looking for Truth about sexuality for their inputs into their mathematical equations. Based on Google porn searches, the author estimates 5% of the population is gay. (Btw, conservatives mostly use the word ‘homosexual’ while liberals use the phrase ‘same-sex’, statistically, in Google searches.)Not to neglect what Google says about what the ladies’ biggest sexual worry is, all I can say is, Oh. My. God. Vagina odor. Really? Really!!All statisticians should take note - interrogative surveys often show different results from those statistics revealed in Google searches about the percentages of who is thinking/feeling what where and when, especially in those morally-weighted or personally embarrassing areas of society. Of course, interpretation is always fraught with possible erroneous judgements whatever the source of sampling. I have always trusted those insurance actuarial tables FAR more than political or media spins or even university data studies - so now I am adding Google statistics to my ‘trusted info’ list. Of course, gentle reader, I know any compilations of data can be erroneously or purposely manipulated or massaged. ‘Garbage in, garbage out’ still applies...which is the case ‘Everybody Lies’ makes as well. The book seemed on top of the science, as far as I know. I am not a science-brain, but an amateur wannabe. My one irritation with this book is all about the manner in which the information is explained. Gentle reader, my complaint is subjective as hell. Honestly, I can’t put my finger on it, though. The writer seemed to be trying to fill out his actual 200-page book to 300 pages by having personal emotional filler similar to the gaspy asides many shows use to increase the viewers’ emotional high about what is being discussed. Are you familiar with those TV shows that, after each commercial break, recap the entire show in the preceding minutes before the commercial break in a breathless montage manner? And they often had a shocked-gasp teaser of what will be shown before the commercial break? Anyway, I felt there was a lot of that style of emotional manipulation (and extending of the material) going on in this book, somehow. I simply did not appreciate the personal ‘fun’ filler so much. Maybe there wasn’t enough snark. I prefer snarky humor, if there is humor. Bite me. Maybe a more tightly edited book would have worked better for me to enjoy reading it. Anyway, I realize I am floundering about here. None of this may be true at all for you.Ultimately, this is a book worthy of reading for the general reader (for the record, I definitely have a lit/history brain, so yes, I am a general science reader!) and the explanatory information about how statistical studies are done (the only math-involved college class which engaged me) and what people are really feeling and thinking (if Google searches are to be believed, and I think they are). Included are extensive Notes and Index sections."
13,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,3,"A pretty short book with some interesting remarks, but not yet charming enough for me. The author definitely has his quirky and funny moments, when he presents himself, his family, and especially his views more. Yet the books' ideas and findings aren't exactly ground breaking. The types of questions like in this book have been posed in Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. The usefullness of big data has been discussed by ones such as Dataclysm: Who We Are (discussion on sex and gender actually resemble Dataclysm a lot). I was looking for something more nuanced, a long and rigorous thematic research on human's tendency, and data as an extremely useful tool but not the main focus. Instead in the book, it's more like a collection of observations. Each time Stephens-Davidowitz has an idea, he looks for an answer from the available data, then moves on. The questions are somewhat related to human's private behaviors that traditionally we can't observe. The tool seems to be a bit more at the center here, but he doesn't discuss the cons and all the ethical implications of big data that deeply enough, except for a short section at the end of the book. Now, that's totally ok, for a casual and light, yet still useful read. More importantly, we have to consider that these types of research and the topic of big data are still relatively new. It takes decades and decades more to build a literature huge enough to draw really meaningful and profound conclusions. The time simply hasn't arrived yet for the book of my taste, but this one, as the author states, hopefully would raise interests in young people, young social scientists, steering them towards potentially fruitful topics and research methodologies. That's why it's a 3 star."
14,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an engaging and informative book about the huge amount of data available online and what it tells us about society. I read it alongside Dataclysm and found Everybody Lies to be by far the better of the two, presenting a wealth of information in a cohesive fashion and making fewer unfounded assumptions. The author was a data scientist at Google, and draws in large part on the searches people make on the site, along with information from sites including Facebook and Pornhub.There’s a lot of interesting stuff in the data, from the rate of racist searches in the rust belt predicting the rise of Donald Trump, to common body anxieties and whether they actually matter to the opposite sex, to an estimate of how many men are gay and whether that varies by geography (it appears not), to rates of self-induced abortions. This is a great book to read if you love unusual factoids, whether on sexual proclivities or how sports fans are made. The author also writes in a compelling way about the uses of Big Data itself, and while he waxes evangelical about it (evidently preferring to spend all his time immersed in statistically significant data, he finds novels and biographies too “small and unrepresentative"" and therefore uninteresting), there are certainly a lot of possibilities there. In health, for instance, compiling early searches about symptoms with later searches for how to handle a diagnosis can help doctors detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage, while epidemics can be tracked through symptom searches. The author is also interested in how applying data can revolutionize a field, discussing at length the data that predicted the success of the racehorse American Pharaoh. (By ""at length"" I mean 9 pages; this is a book that moves through a broad range of topics quickly.)Overall, the writing is engaging and the book hangs together well, being informative while mostly resisting the urge to speculate. But the author does make a couple of assumptions worth pointing out. One is that people’s Google searches are made in earnest and for personal reasons. Certainly, you might search for “depression symptoms” out of concern that you or someone you know is depressed. But you also might want to be prepared in advance to identify warning signs, or might have encountered something in the media that sparked your interest, or you might be a student writing a paper on the topic. On the other hand, if you’re intimately familiar with depression already, you’re unlikely to google the symptoms. None of this means the author’s finding a 40% difference in rates of depression symptom searches between Chicago and Hawaii isn’t relevant, but data that’s both over- and under-inclusive serves better as a starting point for research than a definitive conclusion. It's certainly not proof that better geography is twice as effective as antidepressants, as the author suggests.The other assumption is that everybody lies: the book insists on it, based largely on the fact that typically rosy social media posts fail to reflect all those unhappy or hateful searches. Selectively sharing information doesn’t necessarily seem to me to be lying, but the author appears invested in proving the book’s title. For instance, he discusses a particular type of tax fraud: in areas where few tax professionals or people eligible for the scheme live, 2% of people who could benefit from this lie tell it, while in areas with high concentrations of both, the rate of cheating is around 30%. The author concludes that “the key isn’t determining who is honest and who is dishonest. It is determining who knows how to cheat and who doesn’t.” This bleak view of the world fails to account for the 70% who don’t cheat even in areas with high levels of knowledge; finding that significant numbers of people cheat if they know how is a far cry from finding that everyone does.So, like the author of Dataclysm, Stephens-Davidowitz is probably a better statistician than sociologist. But if you’re interested in Big Data, or in getting a peek at the thoughts and anxieties people ask Google about because they’re not comfortable sharing with others, this is the book I recommend. You’ll certainly get a lot of interesting tidbits from it, along with perhaps new inhibitions about typing things into Google!"

It speaks about how people say one thing, or respond to a poll, yet they are lying. They lie less online than having to face someone.How everything that is searched is checked and through the data searches a lot can be noted. Examples of this include what people are doing while out of work, how they feel about their children, politics, and more. Even how racist the country is at certain times.Interesting. I guess the people that study this data know more about us than we know ourselves!😁"
16,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz offers an amusing example of lying. He cites a follow-up on a survey of high school student behavior:  “...a meaningful percent of teenagers tell surveys they are more than seven feet tall, weigh more than four hundred pounds, or have three children. One survey found 99 percent of students who reported having an artificial limb to academic researchers were kidding.” (Location 4702) Students like to mess with adults he cautions. Of course I didn't need to read the book to learn that. When he was a teen, my son clued me in when I expressed alarm at the results of a survey conducted by his high school indicating high usage of drugs and alcohol. What I did learn from this book was how analytical tools are helping researchers make sense of the vast amounts of data out there, data harvested from unwittingly honest interactions.The author is a Big Data specialist and he has written an engaging and approachable book about a highly technical subject. His analytic arsenal includes Google Trends, Google Correlate, Google N-gram, and Google Adwords. He uses these tools to uncover startling and even appalling revelations about sexual proclivities conveyed in Google searches. From there he moves on to more serious topics such as the role of racism in political outcomes and gender bias themes in parenting. Most of what he reveals is unexpected and contrary to conventional wisdom in a big way. Stephens-Davidowitz appeals to a wide range of interests in this book. He explores a concept called Doppelganger Searching as it was used to predict the trajectory of David Ortiz's career in major league baseball. (It's a perverse irony that Ortiz was the victim of mistaken identity — a figurative “doppelganger” — in a near fatal shooting). Much has been written about abuses of Big Data. Stephens-Davidowitz is not unmindful of this problem, although his concerns will not assuage the fears of those concerned with privacy issues. If anything, the power of the tools he wields might heighten that anxiety. Stephens-Davidowitz explains in reader-friendly fashion other technical concepts besides Doppelganger Searching. He tackles the “curse of dimensionality” — a problem relevant to social science research where the number of variables can expand almost infinitesimally. He cautions against the addictive power of metrics in another amusing example which many readers might identify with. He relates how a marketing professor became obsessed with her count on a pedometer:  “She walked early in the morning, late at night, at nearly all hours of the day — twenty thousand steps in a given twenty-four hour period. She checked her pedometer hundreds of times per day, and much that remained of her human communications was with other pedometer users online, discussing strategies to improve scores.” (Location 2908)An intriguing idea Stephens Davidowitz proposes is that Big Data analysis can breach the boundary between correlation and causation through A/B testing. He offers some tests; the reader will be astonished at how widely the data diverges from an initial gut reaction. Explanations of behavior constantly see-saw between the microcosm of stories from individual viewpoints and confident generalizations based on flawed statistics. Seth Stephens Davidowitz sees Big Data analysis as a possible bridge between these two methodologies. This was an eye-opening book worth reading by anyone interested in public policy decision-making. NOTES:I read the Kindle edition of this book. The editors have taken a step in the right direction. Asterisks tag the author's comments and readers can easily toggle back and forth to the main text. On the other hand, footnotes are not marked in the text. The reader is forced to read the footnotes and conduct a search to link them back to the relevant passages."
17,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13960480-caroline,5,"I wish I could give this book more than five stars. Anyone who has a sneaking feeling that Americans aren't who they SAY they are will find confirmation here. It's also easy to read, no academic language here.I was already riveted by the introduction. His premise is that we all lie to each other, pollsters, and ourselves, but not to that white box where you type internet searches. Both before and after the election everyone went nuts trying to figure out why Trump was doing so much better than polls would indicate, looking for factors that would explain it. There was only one. ""[Nate] Silver found that the single factor that best correlated with Donald Trump's support in the Republican primaries was that measure I had discovered four years earlier. Areas that supported Trump in the largest numbers were those that made the most Google searches for 'n-----'."" (He uses the real word, which deepens the revulsion you feel at what he's discovered.)Despite Obama's two easy election victories and the narrative that we were post-racism, the Google search data tells another story about reactions to those victories.Immediately after the San Bernadino shootings, what happened online? A ton of people searched for ""kill Muslims.""And there is a lot more, about sex and child abuse and sexism. Did you know that the most common term used to complete the sentence ""Is my son..."" is 'gifted' or some variant thereof, and the most common term used to complete the sentence ""Is my daughter..."" is 'overweight'?America is not post-anything except maybe post-good intentions.What use does he think this can be? Well, he did have some good suggestions, and none of them are based on finding out who any individual is who's done a search. For example, if searches for ""kill Muslims"" spike in a certain city, a few extra police could be deployed to watch over the local mosque until the spike subsides. He spends a moment talking about how big data is not meant to be, and should not be, used to try to figure out who specifically is going to commit crimes.By the time I was done with this book I was a bit discouraged at who Americans seem to be, but it's better to know. I hope that this kind of study continues, so we can attempt to realistically work with our society instead of pretend it's something it's not."
18,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"Believe the hype. This is not a perfect book, but it's fun, enlightening, ground-breaking, and important. Too many people don't know the potential power of the new methodologies of data analytics, and too few ppl who think they do know that power don't know the limitations. SethSD does, and he shares a lot of what he knows with us. This is good science for arm-chair science consumers like me, and a good read for those who just like to dabble in non-fiction. It's both concise and rich. Documented with notes, and index, and the author's own website which he promises has lots more hard info. It may turn out to be a four-star book as more on the topic get published. But right now I urge everyone to read it. Next, I do hope to read Seth's next book, and more on the subject. Yes, Seth, I did read right to the end, and still I'm glad you didn't keep struggling to say anything for the ages in your conclusion... imo, you ended it perfectly.On a personal note, one of the key points from the intro. and one of the key points from the conclusion are amazingly relevant. Here's the thing. Our youngest is looking for a school to transfer up to, at the same time we're looking for our first post-retirement community. We're hoping to find a college & town all three of us would like, and a particular field of study for our kid. In the beginning of this book are two maps, one that reveals Trump supporters, and one that reveals pockets of closet racists as exposed by their Google searches)... which is obviously relevant data for us as we choose what part of the country to move to. And at the end of the book, Seth tells my geeky son what studies to focus on:""I hope there is some young person reading this right now who is a bit confused on what she wants to do with her life. If you have a bit of statistical skill, an abundance of creativity, and curiosity, enter the data analytics business.""(Well, my young person has been listening to me read bits from the book, but otherwise that could have been directly tailored for him.)Read the book. Don't be fooled by my long review; I'm only sharing a bit of what I learned from it.Other book darts:""[P]laces with the highest racist search rates included upstate New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, industrial Michigan and rural Illinois, along with West Virginia... The true divide... was not South versus North; it was East versus West. You don't get this sort of thing much west of the Mississippi. And racism was not limited to Republicans....""The 4 powers of Big Data can be summarized: ""Offering up new types of data...""""Providing honest data...""""Allowing us to zoom in on small subsets of people...""""Allowing us to do many causal experiments....""Now we get to an example of what is not perfect about the book. First, context: Seth is a careful scientist; he knows about sampling errors, biases, correlation not equaling causation, etc. However, sometimes he forgets about alternative explanations and interpretations. That is to say, when the book shows us data, it's fine, but sometimes when Seth interprets the data, he gets trapped by a fallacy. Eg, he says, ""[O]f the minority of women who visit PornHub, there is a (25%) subset who search... for rape imagery... sometimes people have fantasies they wish they didn't have and which they may never mention to others."" Maybe... or maybe they're victims trying to process, or maybe they're wannabee authors doing research, or they're men lying to present as female.... It looks to me like Seth didn't want to think too hard about this one....Big data allows researchers to zoom in on subsets of demographic groups, and geographical regions.... ""But another huge--and still growing--advantage of data from the internet is that is easy to collect data from around the world.... And data scientists get an opportunity to tiptoe into anthropology.""Big data could really help in the field of healthcare. When I'm done here I'm going to check out the site PatientsLikeMe.com. ""Heywood hopes that you can find people of your age and gender, with your history, reporting symptoms similar to yours--and see what has worked for them.""I also want to consider reading Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked and Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-By-Numbers Is the New Way to Be Smart."
19,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,"I sought out the book after reading an interview with the author, and it was totally worth it. The book is quite enlightening, and to be honest, deeply frightening. Internet data can work miracles for the benefit of humanity, but it can bring to life many unimaginable, Big-Brother-type nightmares (current US presidents not excluded, just sayin...). Still, it's good to know."
20,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,2,"At 58%, I give up. DNF.I've seldom read anything that contained so many individually interesting (if shallow) sentences and still bored the hell out of me. I'm also tired of reading about the author's infatuations with baseball, Google, and porn. I am counting this book as read, however, because I should get some small (if valueless) reward for the time I lost reading it. Some random, non-linear thoughts because I'm not interested enough in the book to try harder at this point: 1. The author worked for Google. Apparently, he's still smitten by them and thinks their massive collection of data on users is the most wondrous gift to humans ever. Of course he does. His degree and career depend on it. I am of the opinion that the most, and perhaps the only, honest thing Google has ever done is when they got rid of their ""Don't be evil"" corporate slogan. Google is kind of like Walmart to me. I don't like it, trust it, or believe anything it claims and use it as little as possible. 2. The fact that the government turned over every American's tax data to whatever researchers want to dig through it--and in such detail that they can trace income changes for every address a single individual has reported from--is worrisome. ""Oh, but the individuals weren't identified."" Bullshit. Maybe not by name, but there is enough info there to cross-match with other data and individually identify people. That every search you've every made is time/location stamped and available to whoever wants it is just effing creepy. While we all should know by now that we're just products to be data-mined for profit, seeing a time-stamped list of an individual's exact searches over a 24-hour period is disconcerting. 3. If this guy is right, I've been using search engines for all the wrong things. (Read that in snark font.) Do people really do Google searches for ""Why are Jews cheap?"" or ""Is my daughter ugly?"" or ""Am I gay?"" Gee, all this time, I've been using searches for things like ""What is the capital of Latvia"" or ""What is the formula to calculating amortization?"" Every now and then I sink to searching for David Bowie music videos. I think I once stooped to ""Why the hell are the Kardashians famous?"" Supposedly women everywhere are Googling ""Does my vagina smell?"" and ""Is my husband cheating""? Well, honey, if you have to ask....4. Data for data sake serves little purpose. It just makes for more noise, not more clarity. 5 . Apparently the author believes that the way to keep readers' interest is to use the most sensationalist examples he could come up with. Throw around a lot of racist terms and references to sex kinks or insecurities. When all else fails, talk baseball and throw in some frat boy humor. I get it: the porn industry drives nearly every internet innovation, from web design to security and data collection. Fine. But the tenth or 15th time he refers to women being worried about vaginal odor or how common Pornhub searches for incest videos are, it comes off as an attempt to be provocative rather than informative. For a chapter or two when that content is relevant to the topic, fine. Every single chapter? Boring. And really creepy after a while. 6. If there is any discussion about the ethics of data mining in this thing, it's so far buried in the back that I didn't get to it. If there is substantive material on statistical relevance, hypothesis testing or phantom populations, it's buried in the back. He's the kid who walks in with his bright, shiny, non-traditional method and basically says he's right and everyone else who ever studied data is wrong. (And maybe, if as the author claims, the last chapters of books don't get read as much as the beginning ones, it's because books are getting less and less informative and/or credible.)"
21,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184066-rachel,1,"I wanted to like this book. It's an interesting topic. But I found the methodology extremely sloppy. Or maybe the author just omitted some key facts. He was clearly determined to prove that racism caused the election of Donald Trump. But it's disconcerting to read the conclusion BEFORE the data analysis itself. On one hand, he says that Obama easily won two terms, DESPITE racism. Then he quickly says that Trump won the 2016 election BECAUSE of racism. So which is it? Is racism so widespread that it caused both candidates to win, the black man despite it, the white man because of it? It makes no sense. Nor was I terribly convinced that Google searches for the word n-gger are actually clearcut reflections of a person who would never vote for a black president but always vote for Trump. That's a pretty big leap of logic. As is his notion that black people would spell it ""n-gga"" therefore all these searches are by white racists. Also, is it a real absolute that racists would never vote for a black president? After all, you could vote for Obama because you feel he's the best of two options, yet still be a flaming racist. Likewise, if you search Google for racist jokes, does that actually prove that you are treating minorities unfairly? It may sound like a reasonable conjecture but this is data science, not an op-ed column. There should be a more decisive connection before making a grand sweeping statement that Trump won due to racists but Obama won despite racists. The author is even sloppier in the section on searches of a pornographic nature. He refers to a data set from a porn site called PornHub. He has to assume that anyone who registers on that site and states ""I am male"" or ""I am female"" is absolutely telling the truth. But how do we know that? Are we sure that men never pretend to be women to chat with others, exchange messages, or share videos on porn sites? I'm not convinced.As was widely reported, 25% of searches by (alleged) women on porn sites are for rather violent porn. I don't mean a little spanking, but hardcore search terms including words like ""brutal"" and ""crying"" and so forth. 20% of the (alleged) women's searches are for lesbian porn. But the author is quick to point out: this is sexual fantasy! It's not real life! Those women aren't actual lesbians, nor do they want to engage in violent sex. But when it comes to men's searches, he regards those as literal fact. If men search for gay porn, it's because they're gay, maybe closeted, but definitely gay. Why does he insist this is true for men, but not for women?The same sloppy reasoning is applied to various other search terms. The fact that ""boyfriend won't have sex"" is far more common than ""girlfriend won't have sex"" is the foundation for his notion that men are more likely to refuse sex to their partners than vice versa. But how do we know that's actually true? What about the notion that women are more likely to SEARCH for a solution to this problem online? The fact is that we know absolutely nothing about the people performing these searches - whether they are male or female, racist or fair-minded, gay or straight. So making assumptions about their motivations based solely on search terms is just poor data science. Maybe there's some essential research that the author omitted. But it looks like pure speculation based on search terms, which is not what I would expect of an author who claims to be a data scientist. Stick with Freakonomics if this topic interests you. "
22,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4452312-steven,2,"This book is kind of a mess, but its subject is interesting enough—and some of the findings are intriguing and potentially important enough—to make you breeze your way through it. I call it a mess, because 1) the title is Everybody Lies, yet Stephens-Davidowitz in no way shows—let alone proves—that everyone lies (only, perhaps, that people tend to keep intimate, embarrassing, and politically incorrect things to themselves or, if they do share them, are more willing to confide in Google than in others through traditional sources of data collection), and 2) the subtitle is What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are, but the book is not about the Internet as such, but about the potentialities of big data in all its manifest forms (text, words, images, bio-data, and so on). Stephens-Davidowitz probably used big data to establish which words people search for and have been buzzing the most...Anyway, having said that, the book doesn't go into nearly as much depth as I would have liked it to—assumptions go unexamined, serious ethical concerns go unaddressed, and alternative hypotheses go unexplored. However, this relative superficiality has as an upside: the book is light and entertaining, although some of the findings that S-D discusses are also shocking and depressing (like how many people search for horrible things online).At the core of the book lie the four 'powers' of big data:(1) It offers up new types of data (e.g., people's sexual desires and preferences gathered through porn sites).(2) It provides honest data (e.g., people's genuine concerns as expressed through questions asked in Google).(3) It allows us to zoom in on small subsets of people (because there is so much data, even small slices of a population can provide meaningful [statistical] information).(4) It allows us to do many causal experiments (e.g., presumable, through the kind of A/B testing done by Facebook and sellers of ads – this is, in my eyes, a problematic area that is not adequately addressed by S-D).For all its weaknesses, some of which merely require some more attention and research, others of which are more fundamental, Stephens-Davidowitz should get credit for the work he has done on and with big data. I do agree with him that it's a very important source of information (which ought to be used with care, all the same) and tool for research, perhaps even—as he definitely seems to think—the most important in and for the future."
23,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"3.5 starsYou may come across as liberal to the world but secretly google racist jokes…..Although you may spill your deepest darkest secrets to Google, make no mistake this data sits somewhere ready to be analysed.I work with big data every day, so I was immediately drawn to this book. But you really don’t need to be in the data industry to appreciate the book. It is written for the layman with humour and interesting titbits sprinkled throughout the book.The first 3rd of the book gives a notable amount of space to data on sex, politics and racism. These are things we are not always honest about with our friends (or even ourselves).The one downside for me was that the data was very USA centric so some of the case studies dealing with baseball or basketball was just not very interesting to me. There were also one or two graphs that were not properly explained. The author is also very passionate about this subject matter which means he sometimes flinted around from one topic to another in such quick succession that you almost lose the point he is trying to makeBut there were sections that I also found fascinating. The explanation of doppelganger search algorithms (this is how Amazon and Netflix suggest books/movies you may like) and its applications across various industries. The case study on how race horses were chosen and how new data also has its limitations were just as great.This is a little like Freakonomics for Big Data and the author himself is clearly a HUGE fan of Steven Levitt as the conclusion read like an ode to his idol.And finally, last week the world got its first glimpse of a black hole, only possible due to the crunching of HUGE data using sophisticated algorithms. Thanks Katie Bouman! This shows just how powerful the application of big data can be.The big questions and mysteries of our time may very well be answered one data set at a time.Recommended"

25,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686221-wen,4,"The title steered me a bit off-course at first—I thought it was one of those self-help psychology books that I tend to avoid. I eventually decided to give it a shot, mostly because Steven Pinker, and author I highly respect, wrote the forward. So glad I did.To the author Mr. Davidowitz , I did finish the book, so did I with regard to the first two books you mentioned below --moot point for the third book as it’s not even on my to-read list ;-) “more than 90 percent of readers finished Donna Tartt’s novel The Goldfinch. In contrast, only about 7 percent made it through Nobel Prize economist Daniel Kahneman’s magnum opus, Thinking, Fast and Slow. Fewer than 3 percent… made it to the end of economist Thomas Piketty’s much discussed and praised Capital in the 21st Century.”As the subtitle suggested, the book was a primer on data science, a still budding field but serves as the very foundation for hot markets du-jour, like artificial intelligence and machine learning.First of all, as informative as the book was, I’d say the book targeted general reading public. It mostly steered clear of mathematical, statistical and programming jargons,. The writing style was of light-heartedness; it certainly did not remind me of a serious (boring??) college textbook. That said, I assume those readers who love numbers and prefer talking in percentage terms would enjoy the book more.  In short, data science in this book was telling stories through data, big data, new data, i.e. the gigantic data sets we now have access to thanks mostly to keywords we put into internet search engines every day. And today even our personal computer might be capable of processing and analyzing such data sets , given increasingly cheaper memory chips and more powerful CPUs, GPUs or other processors.While Davidowitz admitted our guts could do a decent job drawing conclusions and making predictions naturally, he pointed out we need big data to “sharpen the picture”. For instance, it is common sense that harsh winter weather could lead to depression (the D-word was frequently brought up by tour guides during my recent vacation in Northern Europe), but how much of a temperature drop could affect people’s mood materially—10 degrees, or 50?? Would other factors, say “economic conditions, education levels, and church attendance”, muddied the picture? And how about our guts getting it totally wrong? The book gave an example of a study that concluded, totally against our intuition, couples maintaining separate sets of friends tend to stay in the relationship longer.So Davidowitz spent the bulk of the book, in Part two, to illustrate “the powers of the big data” that we have access today: 1)	new types of data that are beyond survey data or tabular data, think tweets and pictures; 2)	honest data, the data generated at the subconscious level, such as doing a Google search (instead of answering a survey), when people are not as inclined to lie;3)	the data granular enough that we could zoom in on small subsets for our particular study;4)	data so large and comprehensive that would allow us to undertake rapid, controlled experiments. Very soon into the book, I spotted its similarity with a very popular title published more than a decade ago that I also loved, Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner. It was not only because Levitt was frequently mentioned in this book. •	The two books shared similar carefree and witty writing style, and were of similar length;•	both tried to employ data to debunk myths largely derived from our intuition;•	as an engaging exercise for the reader, both gave lists of factors and asked readers to guess which ones had significant impact on the outcome, then gave the answers; •	both devoted a large portion explaining the distinction between “causation” and “correlation”, and describing the A/B testing, the randomized, controlled study;•	the two books even tackled a similar subject, albeit from different angles, whether the school choice determines the student’s later success.Essentially, both books encouraged readers to think out of the box and ask the right questions. Of course this book was more up-to-date; it listed data sources--Google Trends, Ngrams, and Correlate, along with unstructured data types that are more relevant to today’s digitally-connected readers. Not surprisingly, at the end of the book Davidowitz revealed that it was the very “rogue economist” Levitt and his Freakonomics that inspired him to pursuit his current career. In fact, Davidowitz explored the same data set, birth certificates data in California which included black residents’ first name ( or if it was a common white name or a distinctive black name). While Levitt’s established the connection between a black person’s first name and his socioeconomic background, Davidowitz built on the study, and used a black person’s first name as a proxy for his socioeconomic background, to study the linkage between this factor and the chance of the person making the NBA. To me this exposed one of the best known pitfalls of data analysis, so-called “garbage in, garbage out”. What if someone came out to prove Levitt wrong in his linkage? That would be like an earthquake to Davidowitz’ subsequent study? It would be great if this topic could be covered in more depth in the sequel of this book. To be fair, Davidowitz covered several limitations of big data in the book, particularly from the moral/ethics standpoint, e.g. price gouging, discrimination, and privacy.There were other parts int the book that I found less convincing. ""... in the prediction business, you just need to know that something works, not why."" As an example, the author cited that Walmart discovered its custoemrs preferred stockpiling Strawberry Pop-tart before hurricanes. So the store should just stock the pastries on its shelves simply based on the data, without confirming the causality first?I'd also be causcious about reading too much into the various first-date signals in the book. So a guy would be more interested in me if I act more like a narcissist? hmmm... Well, as an intro the book only scratched the surface of data science. And yet, it was an enjoyable, fast-paced, thought-provoking read. I decided to change my rating to 4, as I think both Freakonomics and Thinking, Fast and Slow mentioned above are relatively better reads."
26,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932035-moshe-zioni,3,"Don't get me wrong, it is nice, funny and worth a short read.A problem for me - the causality vs correlation part comes waaaay too late in the book and the author sometimes mix the two IMHO. The biggest thing to tackle for Data Scientists is the issue of causality and if/how it can be proven to be, most of the times it just cannot be proven by this method because of its built-in limitation but the author makes a pass on this and this all makes some assumptions, as possible they can be, naive in nature."

29,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"UPDATE: In summary, the author bounces back and forth between real data/numbers and pure speculation. It's fascinating, really, as that's got to be the entire point: to show us how to tell what's real and what's fiction as we are bombarded by information.. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Yes, ""Everybody Lies"" including, obviously, the author because if Seth Stephens-Davidowitz never lies, I'm sure the subtitle would have been ""Except Me Within This Book"". So, from our data thus far, we know the author lies, and maybe even within this book. The author's first major error comes from a hilarious statement about how gay men like Judy Garland (one can only suppose the author's sample is his gay uncles and their friends, in which case he should have used Edith Piaf instead, or maybe Bette Midler, as both Bette and Piaf were indeed placed into stardom by gay communities, while Garland was a star for everyone who went to the movies in 1939 and saw her in ""Wizard of Oz"". Oh, I'm digressing, sorry. I liked some of this book: specifically the parts where real numbers/data are used: for example, in 1950 a survey revealed 20% of a certain sample said they had a library card, but the official sample count indicated only 13% actually had one. (Why, oh why, would any adult in the USA NOT have a library card? This boggles my mind.) But get this ridiculous utilization of words: ""...the overwhelming majority of black Americans think they suffer from prejudice....On the other hand, very few white Americans will admit to being racist."" Good grief. EVERYONE has prejudices (that's how we get through this chaotic world, as we are prejudicial for, say, driving instead of flying because we like road trips and like to stop at places we have never visited and meet people we would otherwise never have a chance to speak with-and I'm talking about me, as long airport lines are no fun) but racism is a different issue entirely, as racism has nothing to do with my prejudicial decision to drive. A section devoted to ""omitted-variable bias"" certainly belongs in another science book this year entitled ""We Have No Idea"". Hilariously, the author concludes with a lot of questions, including this howler: ""Where do sexual preferences come from?"" The answer is simply one of genetics (in combination with epigenetics, which may turn ""on"" or ""off"" these genes) but that's old news. Hence, can we conclude that all economists and statisticians don't read current books and journals regarding genetics. Hardly, but one would assume an editor somewhere would catch this issue. In summary: when the author uses real, solid numbers (the number of likes on Facebook vs that same person's internet searches - and let's keep in mind google doesn't release names, but does release the number of loving wives who praise their husbands on facebook and then the number of wives who googles ""Is My Husband Gay"". Now that I think about it, why such a fixation on gay matters? A better title for this book would have been, ""Everybody Lies About Their Sex Life"" cause we know absolutely that is true."

Some favourite revelations below. --------Voting--------Nearly everyone predicted Clinton would win the 2016 election. But Stephens-Davidowitz wouldn’t have, looking at Google data. Googling “Clinton” or “Trump” doesn’t really say much (you might google them whether you hate or love them) but if you google “Clinton Trump debate” or “Trump Clinton polls” that reveals a lot: you tend to list the candidate you support first in those searches, so geographic areas with more “Clinton Trump” searches than “Trump Clinton” will probably end up going for Clinton. Other things, like searching for how or where to vote, which predict voter turnout, can be analyzed (areas with high population of black Americans did not have many of these, and since black Americans as a group supported Clinton over Trump, that would hurt Clinton). It also reveals that unexpected areas are the most racist. Rather than southern US, it’s Appalachia that searches the most racist terms- particularly eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, etc. and some neighouring Great Lakes states (Indiana, Michigan, Illinois)- some of which are major swing states that went for Trump this election. The single greatest predictor of whether a region would support Trump? Not employment, religion, gun ownership, immigration. No, the single greatest predictor, with the highest correlation to Trump support, was number of Google searches in that area for the n-word. Jesus fucking Christ.--------Sports--------If you’re over 7 feet tall, you have a 1-in-5 chance of making it to the NBA. That’s right: of all the 7ft+ tall men in America, 20% are/were NBA players. Makes you wonder how much sports “natural talent” is just height + daily practice. --------Relationships--------Having friends in common is a predictor that a relationship will not last. Read: space is a good thing. --------Intelligence--------Your kid is most likely to achieve fame and success if they grow up in certain areas- particularly, places with lots of universities. Big cities (Boston, NYC) and college towns (Ithaca, NY) alike. Want them to be even more successful? Live somewhere with a high number of immigrants. Yes, even if you aren't an immigrant yourself, being somewhere with many immigrants will contribute to your kid's success.Facebook likes for Mozart, thunderstorms, and curly fries (???) are correlated to high intelligence. Correlated to low intelligence are Facebook likes for Harley Davidson motorcycles, Lady Antebellum, and the ""I love being a mom"" page. ~~~~~~~Book Riot's Read Harder Challenge~~~~~~~#14: A book of social science"
31,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,This book looks into the things we reveal about ourselves that no one can see except Google. Big Data overturns rocks and reveals some creepy crawlies in our body politic lurking on the underside of our public face. Be it very revealing searches on Pornhub to people looking for racist jokes on their search engines some ugly things are happening with people when no one is looking but your (hopefully anonymous) web browser. Aggregate data reveals our kinks some of which are quite dark and people's racism which is even darker. Big data has the ability to turn soft social sciences into something much more firm. Hand waving goes out the window when good data takes hold. This book might be worth a look because the things that are being revealed will soon loom larger as big data gets more refined in its techniques.
32,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9492590-tressa,1,"I couldn't even make it through the introduction. This is a perfect example of starting with a conclusion and then finding the data to support your conclusion. All a search shows you is the number of times the word or phrase is searched. It does not show intention. It does not show the number of times a certain person searches for the same word or phrase. The author makes a lot of assumptions based on his own presuppositions. I thought this would be a fun read, but I have no intention of slogging through a heavily biased account of his own ideas. Data is just that-data. It is one piece of a puzzle. It is not the puzzle. "
33,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"There are so many things to love about this book. Not the least of which is that it focused largely on how big data would act like a truth serum and replace terrible self report findings when trying to answers myriad questions that arise in all areas of life. I say bravo to that! However, just because you identify a problem with one measurement method (self-report), it does not necessarily mean you have found the fix. Does big data sound extremely promising? Hell yes. In fact, i think when we learn how to escape the many pitfalls of trying to collect big data to represent an accurate picture (those are some humongous pitfalls that have not been adequately addressed in this book), big data might be our best bet at understanding human nature. Some aspects of big data already seem solid and trustworthy. For example, people indicate they will watch a certain type of movie on Netflix-- perhaps a documentary, an intellectual film, or the like-- but they watch a mindless comedy instead and often. No matter how many of one type of movie a person puts in their Netflix queue, their actual watching habits are far more reliable at predicting what types of movies they like to watch than what they have chosen, themselves, to put in their own queue. There are plenty of other examples scattered throughout the book that are similarly compelling. You will find excellent data mining that shed light on things from the election of Trump to the things people really worry about but won't admit. Data helped Nate Silver figure out how Trump won the 2016 primary. It turned out that Trump won in areas that had googled the word ""nigger"" most often in the year leading up to the primary. Controlling for other factors, this is an extremely disturbing finding. There were other really interesting examples of what people search for in different areas of the USA and different areas of the world that give us an extremely candid picture of what they might be thinking. I say might because it is entirely possible that people who are concerned about the things their neighbors say or do, might also look those things up. The effect might be smaller than it seems. Nevertheless, all of these searches are a valuable window at least into what people are thinking about. And speaking about what people are thinking about, it seems that the main concern for men is how big their penis is. For women it is if their vagina smells bad. It seems to be a downright preoccupation.As much as I loved this book, and I have to say there were many parts that I really, really loved, I was sorely disappointed at times. The author is certainly more critical than most in his thinking, and takes pains to convince the reader as such. However, if you are going to write a book about how to think critically, you should probably be in the top 1% of critical thinkers. Chapter Five tells me that probably is not the case. He cited experts' concerns that violence in movies cause violent behaviors and then cited a study that had serious fundamental flaws. The study sought (I use the term sought lightly) to find out if violent movies caused violent actions. Turned out that on weekends that violent movies were shown, violence went down, not up. On weekends with non-violent movies, violence went up. Mind boggling! or so the author claims. Not really. It's easy to imagine many, many reasons why this might be. The authors of the study concluded, using absolute conjecture) is that it keeps violent people occupied. I will buy that……. in the short term. But, that doesn’t prove whether violent movies cause or do not cause violent acts. Violent acts can sometimes take a long time to cultivate. You cannot measure them by a weekend​. This study was not a lone lapse in critical thinking, and that bothered me because this book is about critical thinking. Overall though, I have to say the great parts outweighed the bothersome parts. I would recommend. ​ ​"

It is amazing how much we can learn about sex, penis size, homosexuality, racism, and many other interesting topics by just looking at the searches made by the people. I can’t wait to read his next book, tentatively titled Everybody (Still) Lies.""More than 40 percent of complaints about a partner’s penis size say that it’s too big."""

The data collected and shared by Seth Stephens- Davidowitz is downright disturbing at times. That there are dark sexual proclivities isn’t shocking so much as what they are, based on research. Also, who knew that your neighbor winning the lottery can have a strange impact on your own life. How odd human nature, what bizarre subjects human beings become, and subjects of research, it seems, we all are. What the heck does google searches reveal about us? A lot, actually. I spent a few chapters of this book with my moth hanging open, catching flies. Ethical questions certainly give rise to much of the research, just where is the ‘internet’ taking us all? Just who is watching, why? Well, read on my fellow test subjects. Do we think in strange ways? Naturally. I struggle with the methods of collecting data and yet, it’s true that while it can be used for nefarious purposes, just like anything else, there can be great benefits too.How can we know what is real? How can anyone trust searches as solid fact? Data makes some of us cross eyed with boredom, but here Seth Stephens-Davidowitz presents it in a manner most people can understand and also be humored and at times shocked by. I will never think about strawberry pop tarts without thinking about hurricanes. A strange comment, but that’s what this book is all about- the bizarre data we provide, whether we realize it or not. Are we really just a bunch of liars? Do we all just masquerade online? Is the world so twisted? Just how much can you really measure to determine the future of what’s hot, what will sell, what stocks will rise and fall? How did one man predict the success of the horse American Pharoah? Who gives corporations the right to use collected data, and should they?How do interests and fun tests measure IQ on facebook? Just what is our doppelganger and why does it matter? And hilariously, how many of the readers finish books? What about this one? Well, I did. I particularly enjoyed the chapter “Was Freud Right?” I wonder, were he alive today, how much of his theories would stand up to actual research. The Banana dream data is food for thought and yes I’m trying to be punny here, I wonder what that means about me, according to research.The information isn’t overbearing, and most of it is fascinating.

36,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz“Everybody Lies” is an interesting angle on how we can reveal who we really are by analyzing big data. Former Google data scientist, BA in philosophy and with a PhD in Economics, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz provides readers with a stimulating look at whom we really by showing how Big Data is best used and explain in detail why it can be so powerful. This revealing 357-page book includes eight chapters broken out by the following three parts: I. Data, Big and Small, II. The Powers of Big Data, and III. Big Data, Handle With Care.Positives:1.	A well written, and engaging book.2.	A fascinating topic, how big data reveals who we are.3.	Stephens-Davidowitz is a gifted and entertaining writer. This is a book that makes an interesting use of the Google tools and reveals some stunning insights. The author is not afraid to make some bold conclusions.4.	The introduction does not waste time to tease the readers. “Surveys and conventional wisdom placed modern racism predominantly in the South and mostly among Republicans. But the places with the highest racist search rates included upstate New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, industrial Michigan and rural Illinois, along with West Virginia, southern Louisiana, and Mississippi.” “Areas that supported Trump in the largest numbers were those that made the most Google searches for the N-word.”5.	The basis of the findings in this book can be summarized in the following quote, “I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important dataset ever collected on the human psyche.”6.	Describes the four powers of Big Data. “There are many unique data sources, on a range of topics, that give us windows into areas about which we could previously just guess. Offering up new types of data is the first power of Big Data.”7.	The importance of being precise. “The Big Data revolution is less about collecting more and more data. It is about collecting the right data.”8.	Interesting insights on the use of Big Data. “First, and perhaps most important, if you are going to try to use new data to revolutionize a field, it is best to go into a field where old methods are lousy.”9.	The book is full of interesting examples. “Walmart suspected—correctly—that people’s shopping habits may change when a city is about to be pummeled by a storm. They pored through sales data from previous hurricanes to see what people might want to buy. A major answer? Strawberry Pop-Tarts. This product sells seven times faster than normal in the days leading up to a hurricane.”10.	Find out if a man and a woman will go on a second date based on how they speak.11.	A look at Facebook. “The fact is, many Big Data sources, such as Facebook, are often the opposite of digital truth serum.”12.	An analysis and examples of the second power of Big Data. “This is the second power of Big Data: certain online sources get people to admit things they would not admit anywhere else. They serve as a digital truth serum.”13.	A fascinating look at hate and prejudice. “On the one hand, the overwhelming majority of black Americans think they suffer from prejudice—and they have ample evidence of discrimination in police stops, job interviews, and jury decisions. On the other hand, very few white Americans will admit to being racist.”14.	The findings regarding abortion. “What drives interest in self-induced abortion? The geography and timing of the Google searches point to a likely culprit: when it’s hard to get an official abortion, women look into off-the-books approaches.”15.	A look at how corporations make use of Big Data. “Netflix learned a similar lesson early on in its life cycle: don’t trust what people tell you; trust what they do.”16.	Describes the advantages of Internet experimentation. “This is the fourth power of Big Data: it makes randomized experiments, which can find truly causal effects, much, much easier to conduct—anytime, more or less anywhere, as long as you’re online. In the era of Big Data all the world’s a lab.”17.	Big Data in the hands of economists. “The average movie in our sample paid about $3 million for a Super Bowl ad slot. They got $8.3 million in increased ticket sales, a 2.8-to-1 return on their investment.”18.	Words of wisdom. “People adapt to their experience, and people who are going to be successful find advantages in any situation. The factors that make you successful are your talent and your drive.”19.	Discusses the limitations of Big Data. “The problem is this: the things we can measure are often not exactly what we care about.”20.	A fascinating look at paying off debts. “You might think—or at least hope—that a polite, openly religious person who gives his word would be among the most likely to pay back a loan. But in fact this is not the case. This type of person, the data shows, is less likely than average to make good on their debt.” “Someone who mentions God was 2.2 times more likely to default. This was among the single highest indicators that someone would not pay back.”Negatives:1.	EBook fails to link to the notes which is a must for books of this ilk.2.	Repetitive.3.	Some of the conclusions are expected.4.	Some of the conclusions may be a stretch. 5.	No formal bibliography. In summary, this is a fun social study book. Stephens-Davidowitz demystifies data science and along the way he makes some startling revelations. He shows data science is about spotting patterns and how variables affect one another. On the other hand, some conclusions may seem a bit of a stretch and the eBook doesn’t take advantage of the linking capabilities, which is a must for this type of book. I enjoyed it, I recommend it!Further suggestions: “Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think” by Viktor Mayer-Schonberger and Kenneth Cukier, “Hit makers” by Derek Thompson, “The Predictive Analytics” by Eric Siegel, “Big Data Made Accessible” by Anil Maheshwari, “Data Smart” by John W.

37,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931387-dan,4,"I recommend this highly with a couple of caveats.The central insight of this book is that you can get a better idea of what people actually think, despite what they say to others (or even to themselves) by looking at Google and Pornhub searches (among other anonymized big data sets). Things that people won’t admit to other people (thoughts of suicide, to whom they are attracted, homicidal thoughts, racist thoughts, dissatisfaction with a marriage, regrets over having children, etc.) are often clearly revealed to Google through searches. This far I’m definitely willing to go, and would recommend the book on that basis. (Unsurprisingly, Facebook is a far less reliable source for honest data sets than google or pornhub.)Big data can tell us a lot, but there are limits. In one sense it’s a bigger tree from which to cherry pick data that might support your view. While Stephens-Davidowitz is very open when results didn’t match his expectations, there is a strong ideological bent in which data he chooses to explore. I wish he’d been upfront about that at the beginning. I don’t object to the ends to which he’s working (I agree with most of them), but I wish he’d put in a disclaimer (like Stephen Jay Gould did at the beginning of Mismeasure of Man). He did put in a chapter at the end about what Big Data can’t do, but since it’s at the end, I think it’s less effective (all the more so since one of his findings is that people are less likely to read the final chapters of a book than the early ones).His conclusion is an argument that Big Data is the best shot for the social sciences to officially move into the realm of “real” science, even claiming that if Karl Popper were alive he’d likely be convinced. I’m not quite so skeptical of the social sciences as Popper was, and certainly no science, even “hard” science, is completely free from the biases of the scientist. But there is definitely more room for ideology to skew results in the social sciences. Stephens-Davidowitz makes a good case that big data (in combination with smaller data) can significantly strengthen the reliability of results. He convinced me that it does, but not to the extent that he believes it does.On the whole, this is an excellent book. Read it with a bit of skepticism, and it will give you a lot to think about. 3.5, but I'm rounding up."
38,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2780292-tadas-talaikis,4,"Interesting data, but sometimes with uncleared assumptions. For example, there is no way to know why exactly some search term is used. Some (?, I don't know how many) data scientists believe their algos based on big data can reveal something about real world. Most often it is not, but this illusion is one the reasons why they have their jobs. I see all this A.I./ML/DL nonsense every day. Movie suggestions, Facebook feed, Google suggestions, all are sh*t, have no way to guess my true intentions (don't know how it's true on larger scale) and only irritate when trying to get to the real target. Maybe they are right on the thing that those ""irritations"" are the drugs to keep people busy on their sh*tty sites.So, everything mentioned should be taken with a grain of salt. Like with mentioned applications for trading, signals here are very weak (in the range of few percents from random) and most often don't create any meaningful improvement over simple things (like pattern recognition) with increased complexity of big data.OK, those assumptions a bit revealed towards the end of the book, but not enough.More down to earth example. I remember doing a lot of searches like ""conservative psychology"", ""conservative idiots"", ""conservative fear"", etc. for research purposes, found a lot of interesting research. And after few months doing ""liberal psychology"", ""liberal idiots"", ""Kennedy the Nazi"", etc. Big data doesn't reflect my true intentions and meaning and what I think (e.g. who am I), because it doesn't take care about individual search sequences that mean only that I am interesting in understanding people, i.e. to be able to ""read the mind"" and discern true meaning of said words. But here's the thing, it's not so two-dimensional that some sentences distributions can be compared to other sentences, because people should take into account much more three-dimensional (intuitive) data to be able to grasp *some* of the truth.Don't be so over-positive with all this ""progress""."
39,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4," For a social scientist such as Stephens-Davidowitz, big data has four central virtues. First, it’s a “digital truth serum”: it supplies honest data on matters people lie about in surveys, for instance racist attitudes, but above all (to quote Mick Jagger) “sex and sex and sex and sex”. Second, it offers the means to run large-scale randomised controlled experiments – which are usually extremely laborious and expensive – at almost no cost, and in this way uncover causal linkages in addition to mere correlations. Third, the sheer quantity of data allows us to zoom in precisely on small subsets of people in a way that was previously impossible. Finally, it provides new types of data.I was fascinated by this book. The data collected by google, Wikipedia, PornHub and even the IRS can give you so much social information, and we are still in the real beginning of this type of study.A few examples that are not really surprising but what is impressive is that you can find them in the data:searches for racist jokes rise about 30% on Martin Luther King Day in the USin the recent Republican primaries, regions that supported Donald Trump in the largest numbers made the most Google searches for “nigger”Analysis of searches related to Flu predict the spread of a Flue epidemic much more accurately and earlier than any information taken from surveys or hospitals.The main interesting fact I found about this is that when we search, we do it completely anonymously and we are completely candid and honest. The result of this information , if correctly analyzed is the most honest large scale information that can be found.I did find some flaws in the logic and conclusions that I found a bit …… too radical but in general it was an interesting read and ….. yes a bit shocking."

LOL.This book is The National Enquirer meets Big Data Science. It features all the stuff that stops people in their tracks in the grocery check out line and grabs their attention: Sex, crime, weird sex, abuse, freaks, drugs and even weirder sex. It’s sometimes on the edge of gratuitous but still an interesting, easy and well-written read.The best part of this book? It validates something that has been suspected for a very long time - people say one thing and do another. And there are a lot of interesting and plausible insights across a broad range of subjects – even out side of sex.That said there were a lot of elements I am not totally bought in to and some things that seem just plain incorrect. While search queries are very interesting and reveling – some of the correlations seem a bit outlandish.Regardless if you like the subject matter or not, it seems like a good beginners look into what really is “Big Data” and how it has become a “thing. A lot of this stuff was never accessible in the past. Although some of my true Big Data scientist friends might cringe at this thought as well as this book. "
41,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"This one's really fascinating. Using google searches and huge data sets on internet activity, Davidovitz shows the secret lives of Americans. What is obvious to everyone by now is that there is a lot of racism that people are putting on the internet that they don't share in polite company. Also interesting are his observations about how surveys and public information does not accurately reveal someone's state of mind. I wish there was a more compelling set of ideas or theories here, but mostly it's interesting information a la Freakonomics. At the end, there is a necessary dose of humility about the ethics of making decisions based on data that I thought was fascinating. Do we warn the girlfriend if her boyfriend has been searching ""how to kill her."" I think yes. Do we arrest him? Probably not. But som of the questions he asks are tougher "

Social scientists are starting to use this information to build deep and richer models of human behavior.

While some ethical issues are discussed, there is also no critical discussion of Internet companies collection of personal data and the uses they have already been put to (a cynic might say because the author is reliant on these companies data for his own research). This topic deserves a much more rigorous and serious book.2-stars."

It's just a collection of big data that didn't really challenge my existing notions nor added any new ideas to my knowledge. Except of course the assertion that many stereotypes are true, and others are false. A selection of my favourite passages from the book On revealing our true selves on the Internet•	Google was invented so that people could learn about the world, not so researchers could learn about people. But it turns out the trails we leave as we seek knowledge on the internet are tremendously revealing.•	In other words, people’s search for information is, in itself, information. When and where they search for facts, quotes, jokes, places, persons, things, or help, it turns out, can tell us a lot more about what they really think, really desire, really fear, and really do than anyone might have guessed•	Facebook data scientists have shown one exciting possibility. They can estimate a country’s Gross National Happiness every day. If people’s status messages tend to be positive, the country is assumed happy for the day. If they tend to be negative, the country is assumed sad for the day.•	Google search data and other wellsprings of truth on the internet give us an unprecedented look into the darkest corners of the human psyche. This is at times, I admit, difficult to face. But it can also be empowering. We can use the data to fight the darkness. Collecting rich data on the world’s problems is the first step toward fixing them. Racism and Searches•	The discrimination black people regularly experience in the United States appears to be fueled more widely by explicit, if hidden, hostility.•	Trump rode a wave of white nationalism. There is no evidence here that he created a wave of white nationalism.•	Zuckerberg had learned an important secret: people can claim they’re furious, they can decry something as distasteful, and yet they’ll still click.

Unfortunately, I'm disappointed by the content. You can finish this book in a day's sitting, it's very simple in content, even though it doesn't read well.If you ever read anything on Big Data before, you work in sciences, you worked on A/B testing or with Google Analytics, you already know everything this book has to over. It's shallow and trivial, filled with personal anecdotes that detracted from structured data and cites too few studies or real sources. It spends pages on basic terms such as explaining the causation/correlation relationships or a/b testing scenarios that any high-school kid who uses google search would know.Its language is also populist, focusing on risqué subjects of sexuality, porn and murder that may seem exciting for a first page or two, but are hollow when you realize that author's actual data is something people could easily replicate in a simple google trends search.It raises much more questions that it answers and its structure is tedious and boring. It constantly uses buzzwords and bashes its points home primitively by tiring the reader with long lists that go on and on and on.The author should take a note from authors such as Hemingway or Steinbeck, that could use simple terms to explain hard things.In conclusion, author actually explains that big data suggests most people don't finish books, so he's not stresses with writing it better. Well, I for one did and I want to tell the author this:What you are trying to sell to people is less valuable that simple Medium blog post. You aren't smart when you pad your thoughts to sell a book. You look like a money grabber. I'm glad I didn't buy this book."

We may hide a lot of our thoughts and desires following the common social norms, political correctness rules, protecting our privacy or, simply, protecting our self-image.But the moment we sit behind our PCs, all this fly away and we feel free to tell Google our darkest secrets.Then comes a data scientist to tell us we are not alone! If you are a British and you feel ashamed to confess you don’t know what EU is, go Google it...If you are a white American and you can’t feel easy to confess you have racial prejudice against Afro-Americans, search for nigger jokes.If you are a Middle Eastern and you have been incriminated to swallow in all your political or religious doubts, go look it up and get in touch with people holding the same views.If you are a homosexual, you can’t be ashamed to search for your type…….It was a truly impressive journey that I would like to try similar ones whenever it’s possible"
48,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60022503-narilka,4,"In Everybody Lies, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz explores the idea behind social desirability bias and how internet searches are helping Big Data paint a clearer picture about society. In short:Many people under-report embarrassing behaviors and thoughts on surveys. They want to look good, even though most surveys are anonymous.Stephens-Davidowitz posits that while people may lie to anonymous surveys they tend to type their true feelings and intentions into Google searches. It is this vast sum of new data that will allow researchers to make better predictions and offers brand new tools to allow insight all aspects of human behavior that direct questioning never could. It's a fascinating idea and the book provides plenty of food for thought. The new age of Big Data is starting to show how wrong many of our assumptions about society are. How Google searches predicted Donald Trump's victory to common body anxieties to why people root for specific sports teams to the value of attending an elite high school to zooming in on health data and how it could change the way we receive care. It's eerie and a bit creepy when you stop and think about what people type into an internet search box, how much of that data is being captured and just what that data is starting to say about society. On the flip side, the author notes that Big Data has many pitfalls and it's a fairly new science that is still in its infancy. "

Not only that but he is adept at choosing to present compelling findings on subjects that I'm sure he knows readers are interested in, because he has that skillset! Do you want to know how to figure out which racehorses are champions? What is the best family configuration for the top NBA stars? What do people who watch porn search for most? The author chooses fun and titillating topics, but he also makes it clear how much more those with his skillset can do with it. The author's writing style is comfortable to read, which is no easy feat when you're talking about statistics and other difficult concepts. The dude obviously is a brainiac but he makes sure you're not intimidated by that fact.

The conclusions he draws display zero insight and fall pray to a thousand logical fallacies. If you do decide to read this, at least be honest with yourself and admit it’s because you are only willing to wander into quantitative subject matter if its going to be chewed up and regurgitated into your right-brain by whatever pop-science overlord has decided to brown-nose his way into NPR interviews and dangle a vaguely titillating subject so he can spend 175 pages stroking his own d*ck.

The description of the A/B Testing platform was usefulI think this book could have been condensed into a magazine article and got the message across more effectively. It was padded out with too many obscure examples that eventually got me into skim mode. Maybe its because I get inundated with American news already but I found this book was too focused on American data so lost some impact in terms of Big Data being an important global issue. Thanks Jim for the recommendation. Every nugget of info is added to the storehouse.

I'm probably not the target audience for this one, and for non-analysts, this is probably a pretty good read. It is well-written, and the author uses some good examples, but overall, it's too simplistic."
53,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"There is a lot to disagree with in Stephens-Davidowitz's take here on Big Data, but there are some fundamental points which he makes well, that make the book as a whole well worth it. One of them is, that the difference between Big Data and regular data is not that you have a million data points instead of a thousand, it's that you have a thousand data points on the kind of people who are one in a thousand. It's not just that you get new answers, it's that you can ask questions you wouldn't even have thought to ask before.My favorite example is when he points out that many of Freud's theories about repressed sexuality and dreams, are now testable. Or, we might say, falsifiable. For example, many people mention foods in their dreams. Bananas, for example, or cucumbers. Also, oranges or apples. It turns out that foods like bananas or hot dogs appear in dreams roughly as often as expected from how often they appear in real life, that is to say, the best predictor of how often a food will appear in dreams is to look at its popularity as a food to eat in waking life. I didn't really need this to know that a lot of Freud's ideas about dreams were bunk, but it was a nice way to test whether my intuition on this was wrong.Another hit to Freud was that data collected by Microsoft on spelling errors indicated that a human was no more likely than a computer program (which randomly mistyped or swapped letters) to misspell words in a way which caused them to spell sexually-oriented words. In other words, Freudian slips appear to be just slips, and a cigar is just a cigar.Stephens-Davidowitz then goes on to hunt bigger game, delving into what people search for on Google, or YouTube, or PornHub (he looks at what kind of porn people search for). Some of the assertions he makes based on this data:- about a quarter of the searches by women on PornHub are for videos of violent assualt or gang rape, an especially high number given that according to Stephens-Davidowitz PornHub does not allow such videos to be hosted on their site- Barack Obama lost about 4% of the vote nationally based on his race, and while the election of Donald Trump did not see a surge in registrations on the Stormfront website, the election of Barack Obama did cause a surge in registrations to that white supremacist website- about half the gay men in the U.S. are still unwilling or unable to be ""open"" about their sexual orientation, and many of them are married to women, many of whom suspect the truth- during the Great Recession, aka the Fiscal Crisis, reports of child abuse dropped substantially, but google searches such as ""my mom beat me"" or ""my dad hit me"" did not, suggesting that child abuse did not drop, only the likelihood of it being reportedIt's not all doom and gloom in Big Data land, of course. But the biggest power of most of the data which Stephens-Davidowitz looks at, is that it is data which comes from people talking to a computer, not a person. Even if they were aware that people had access to aggregated search data (and most people don't know this), the person making the search can ask questions, confess fears, or express hatereds that they would not usually do to a person. Why is this? In most cases, it is because they don't think what they asking, or saying, is going to be perceived very favorably.For as long as we have had social sciences, we have had the problem of how much to trust self-reported data from surveys. If you ask a person whether they are gay, or if they have ever cheated on their spouse, or if they hate people because of their race, or if they abuse their children, or if they were ever abused as a child, will they tell you?Of course, the sources that we get from places on the internet are not perfect either. For example, the women who search for videos about violent sex on PornHub might not be telling us anything about the sexual fantasies of women; they might just be telling us that women with abnormal sexual desires are a lot more likely to search for porn on PornHub. The people who search for racial jokes on Google might or might not be a typical cross-section of the people who bear ill-will towards people of that race. The assertion that Obama lost 4% of the national vote due to racism seems to imply that there are millions of voters who normally would vote Democratic, but are too racist to vote for a black presidential candidate. It also implies that a candidate with a mediocre economy and a lot of controversial legislation to his name should have scored about 55% of the popular vote in 2012, better than Bill Clinton in 1996.But, while it may not be perfect, it is almost certainly imperfect in a different way than the very imperfect self-report survey, and when trying to determine the truth about a topic as complicated as humans, it helps to have as many different tools to work with as possible. This book is a good introduction to the many ways in which it will help us to learn more about ourselves, and each other, whether we like it or not."

In the era of Big Data all the world’s a lab
Oh, how I relished this chance to really take apart and nit-pick this brain-candy of a book! Everybody Lies.. can be categorized into 3 sections : Part I & II : For the newbie. A series of one example following the other on how big data can be used. Very frequent illustrations of racism/ sexual proclivities/ porn ;)Zuckerberg had learned an important secret: people can claim they’re furious, they can decry something as distasteful, and yet they’ll still click.And he learned one more thing: for all their professions of seriousness, responsibility, and respect for others’ privacy, people, even Harvard students, had a great interest in evaluating people’s looks....President Obama said, “Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors, our co-workers, our sports heroes and, yes, they are our men and women in uniform, who are willing to die in defense of our country.”After this line, for the first time in more than a year, the top Googled noun after “Muslim” was not “terrorists,” “extremists,” or “refugees.” It was “athletes,” followed by “soldiers.” And, in fact, “athletes” kept the top spot for a full day afterward.When we lecture angry people, the search data implies that their fury can grow. But subtly provoking people’s curiosity, giving new information, and offering new images of the group that is stoking their rage may turn their thoughts in different, more positive directions...Part III (the shortest and most, most important part by far!) talks about how can we harness the power of big data. Can we beat the stock markets? Does big data endow us with God - like powers to read consumer minds? (note : No! Big data and the conventional,boring old 'small data' must go hand in hand --> The Outside View: Fashion’s Suicidal Path - Martin Lindstrom)Can we use it to predict and avoid murders ? The author throws some interesting ethical dilemmas rising out of possible suspects' behaviour. Do we arrest people just for 'researching' a crime? A danger of the data revolution is that, as more of our life is quantified, these proxy judgments can get more esoteric yet more intrusive.Better prediction can lead to subtler and more nefarious discrimination"
55,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,4,"By the author’s admission, this is the Google-generation version of his favorite book, Freakonomics.As we’ve repeatedly found in elections all over the planet, the survey is an imperfect tool, chiefly because people lie. Hence the name of the book. But they don’t lie when they are doing a Google search. So that’s “digital truth serum.” You can use this cornucopia of data both 1.	to establish facts but also 2.	to discover correlations. If you use it cleverly you can even detect causation. The author walks you through a large number of fun examples.If you want to find out what part of their body men and women most frequently research on Google, you’ve come to the right place. If you want to find out how searches for the n word correlate with states Hillary lost despite being ahead in the polls, again you have come to the right place. If you want something better than a stab in the dark regarding the age we pick our football team… you get the idea.You do get the impression, however, that the author is IMMENSELY happy with himself. This is a very smug book. All self-deprecatory commentary here (and there’s a lot of it and it’s often funny) feels fake.True to his field, psychology, at least half the time author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is talking about sex. So, for example, when he goes looking for the percent of men who are gay, it’s all based on research he’s done trolling on, erm, sorry, analyzing, porn websites. I’m really not kidding when I’m telling you the man’s got one thing on his mind. Bottom of page 124, in a footnote, you can see what he really wanted to call the book. It’s not “little house on a prairie.”Also, and I hate to be a pedant, for all the “applied statistics” rigor you find in the book, he fails to mention that if your work is based on porn websites, then you are assuming that the property you are researching is exhibited in the same proportion amongst those who frequent porn websites as it is in the general population. Can that be true if the property you are researching is sexual in nature?Regardless, I spent all my time laughing when I was reading this. I was done with it within 48 hours. I could read more. Although I’m annoyed that the author has pretty much pre-announced the sequel, I think I’ll buy it."
56,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280889-drtaxsacto,4,"This book was worth the time, with several caveats. The Author's contention is that big data can help us understand how human beings do things, within limitations. Stephens-Davidowitz has worked for Google and also for the NYT. And he has toyed with all sorts of Google data sources and even wrote a dissertation on how to use ""big"" data. He makes a couple of assertions that seem correct. For example, he argues that we a much more honest in anonymous searches than in social media postings. So if you want to find out how happy people are you can do that much more accurately by using Google search data than Facebook data. And he presents some very interesting things he gleaned from Google searches. Males become attached to baseball teams around age 7 or 8 while females become involved in their 20s. The number of searches for all sorts of consumer products is much more reliable in anonymous data than social media.The author offers a great comparative chart - Searches, Page Views, Clicks and Swipe data is truthful; social media posts, likes and profiles may or may not be truthful. A second key truth is that people in different parts of the world may use different searches and terminology. He also does an interesting discussion of a technique called A/B testing which does small scale tests of groups for their response to different things on a web page. Where I had a problem with the book is the Author's contention that data aggregation will find us answers to many issues where we are not well informed. His contention is that as we continue to be playful with data sources we will continue to get new information about human behavior (I agree) but he also seems to be a lot more exuberant about how easily data will yield answers on a host of questions. He reminds us that correlation does not equal causation but then proceeds to suggest a number of issues where he seems to think the general rule is wrong."
57,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,3,"Everybody Lies (2017) by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is an interesting look at how big data gleaned from the internet can give us a better picture of what people are really like. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz (SSD) did a PhD in economics using search terms from the internet. After his PhD SSD worked at Google. He's clearly seen a lot of data and thought about it and found a lot of interesting stuff.The book emphasizes that what people say in public and put on Facebook isn't what they are thinking. The dramatic use of racist search terms and their locations when President Obama was elected gave a great correlation for where Donald Trump would do well. People say how great their spouses are on Facebook, then they search for why they aren't having sex with them on google. People outright lie about how many condoms they are using, with both sexes exaggerating substantially.The book refers frequently to Freakonomics and Steven Levitt and the author states and shows his admiration for the work of Levitt and the way he looks for interesting data.There are some other interesting observations about violent films and crime, which someone will hopefully soon extend to violent video games and some interesting notes on selective schools. There is even some things on the most unread books around.The book makes the point that social science and literary studies have a fantastic new source of great data in big data. It's an interesting and seemingly valid point.It's not a bad book and it would be hard to go through without learning something. SSD writes well and there are some fun facts on the way. It's not great, but well worth a look. "
58,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,3,"Insightful yet vague.Too much statistics and data. I was expecting some sort of coding; how to use big-data to analyze data. There was NONE. Acceptable; as it was written in layman terms but Seth at least should have mentioned how to collect data (manually or otherwise) for analyzing data like breaking/forming new habits at personal level.Sexual facts are depressing and throughout the book it looked like Seth only wanted to describe sexual habits of common people. (In view of it does not expose or minimize mental habits).He also left a trail for conglomerate-advertising companies- i.e; how-to-manipulate people.Albeit these facts, 
Data science 
takes a natural and intuitive human process—spotting patterns and making sense of them which I found highly beneficial for mankind; for forming habits, getting rid of addictions and making personal/collective lives efficient and better.We are often wrong, in other words, about how the world works when we rely just on what we hear or personally experience.
If you're interested in statistical data about how patterns, habits and addictions are made, this book is for you. WARNING: It can expose certain bad habits of readers to himself/herself which can be funny or embarrassing to him/herself.

I surely recommend it to be read apart from low-ratings. It opens door for pondering and analyzing what's wrong with us and society as a whole. It only takes collection of A LOT OF DATA to achieve which can be a pattern.

59,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4734912-jason,4,"It would be easy to dismiss this as a derivative Freakonomics clone or some Pollyanna PR piece for Big Data. And, yeah, it kind of is. But it's also something even better: an analysis of how mining the massive amount of data derived from Google searches, Facebook posts, video views, etc. can reveal new insights into human behavior unavailable through traditional sources of primary research--surveys, interviews, case studies, etc. Basically, everyone lies, as the book's title indicates, and, even on completely anonymous surveys and with no actual reason to lie, people reveal an inaccurate, idealized picture of themselves at odds with their actual beliefs and behavior. What Stephens-Davidowitz demonstrates here is that people are often less abashed in their anonymous Google searches and will actually reveal their racist beliefs, their deepest insecurities, and their sexual predilections. The book works best when it deals with pornography (a strange sentence I'm sure I've never typed before), which is, of course, the most obvious example of something a large number of people view and would probably not mention even in an anonymous survey. Clearly there's a lot to understand about people all over the world based on the pornography they view online, and the author does a pretty great job of presenting it. His tone is light and clever and his jokes often hit their mark. So, if Everyone Lies is this decade's Freakonomics, it's a worthy successor well worth checking out."

Easy reading and very revealing ... people don't always express what's on their minds, but their google searches give them away! Surprisingly large number of google searches for taboo stuff like ""nigger"" and ""I want to have sex with my (fill in the blank, most common is ""mother""), as well as men worrying how their sex organs' sizes compare with other guys', and women worrying about the odor of their sex organs (the author concludes that people are too self-conscious about their own shortcomings to worry too much about their partners'.) The author is funny and I found myself thinking more than once, ""this kid is really full of himself,"" but laughing while thinking it. I would question some of his conclusions. Although he points out the hazards of confusing correlation with causation, he begins the book by insulting half the American voters by linking Donald Trump supporters with racist tendencies. While colorful, political bias is unseemly in a science/data type book. The author's blatant Barack Obama worship also apparently leads him to some conclusions about that election that I do find even more unconvincing (the Trump/racism link may have validity; the author does not offer concrete evidence, though.). Worth reading. Big Data is the Big Thing right now."

Narrator Andres Pabon does a nice job, just enough intonation at the aha! parts without sounding fake. It's a very good audiobook, and there is an amazing amount of sex in it (gotcha!) since much of the early study of internet searching, marketing and money-making has its roots in pornography. Most hilarious and weirdly, most cued in to human behavior, are the top searched phrases about various body parts. I think this book would work just as well in print.

I was halfway into it and ready to put it aside, funny curiosities about what people search on Google or what Facebook data says about us simply doesn't cut if for me anymore. I think Yuval Noah Harari set the bar too high in Homo Deus, by covering most interesting findings big data has to offer in an elegant and concise manner.However, the second half of the book covers a bit more of human behaviour, data misrepresentations and the extent to which big data can be applied. I found that to be unique and informative enough to do some research on my own.Although Big Data is no longer considered to be the new kid on the block, it is still very important (Google and Facebook are definitely making a hefty profit out of it), but the sooner fields like psychology, sociology, anthropology are going to embrace it, the better for us as human beings."

I really enjoyed the first half of the book which contained most of the interesting research. Some of his speculations are definitely questionable, but not as bad as 'Freakonomics.'

The author managed to keep me intrigued the whole time and didn't completely lose me even when he started talking about baseball. The book is written in a fun and engaging style (sometimes you get to guess the correct answer because it is revealed to you etc.) but it also covers some grim topics and facts gleaned from Google searches and similar sources that can be very unsettling to read about, including sexual violence, various sexual practices, racism, sexism, child abuse, suicide, self-induced abortions and probably some more. Although the author is obviously enthralled with Big Data and raves about its potential, he didn't fail to mention its limitations and potential problems, both from the scientific and ethical perspective. However, I thought it was weird that he didn't once mention that people often google things, which are in no way connected to their personal lives, for work or other purposes. There were times when the humor failed to be charming and bordered on being distasteful. Other than that, I found the book very accessible and full of highly interesting and sometimes truly surprising facts and implications.

El autor se hace mil preguntas y las responde usando big data, principalmente mediante el análisis detallado de las búsquedas que la gente hace en Google (y en otros sitios, como PornHub). El origen del libro es fantástico: [Nathan] Silver found that the single factor that best correlated with Donald Trump’s support in the Republican primaries was that measure I had discovered four years earlier. Areas that supported Trump in the largest numbers were those that made the most Google searches for “nigger.”Lo cual le lleva al autor a hacer una declaración de intenciones: I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important dataset ever collected on the human psyche. [...] In fact, at the risk of sounding grandiose, I have come to believe that the new data increasingly available in our digital age will radically expand our understanding of humankind.El autor nos lleva de viaje por un montón de temas interesantes. Uno de los que más me ha gustado es la vieja, viejísima regunta: ¿Qué porcentaje de la población es gay? Un viejo estudio de los años 60-70 decía que una de cada 10 personas es gay. Pero el autor lo reduce a 1 de cada 20 y explica tan bien como ha llegado a esa conclusión que me ha convencido del todo, es una cifra que parecía imposible de saber con precisión y el tío va y lo hace. Hay muchos datos, como nuestros likes y preferencias en Facebook, que también sirven para cosas, pero no para todo. NUestras búsquedas en Google son siempre sinceras. Nuestros likes de Facebook no. De dos revistas con la misma tirada, una de cotilleos y otra de literatura, en FB la de literatura tenía más del doble de likes que la de cotilleos. Lo mismo pasa con las encuestas: Many people underreport embarrassing behaviors and thoughts on surveys. They want to look good, even though most surveys are anonymous. This is called social desirability bias.Más datos interesantes: After making their decision—either to reproduce (or adopt) or not—people sometimes confess to Google that they rue their choice. This may come as something of a shock but post-decision, the numbers are reversed. Adults with children are 3.6 times more likely to tell Google they regret their decision than are adults without children.About 28 percent of girls are overweight, while 35 percent of boys are. Even though scales measure more overweight boys than girls, parents see—or worry about—overweight girls much more frequently than overweight boys.On weekends with a popular violent movie, the economists found, crime dropped.Students who were taught fractions via a game tested worse than those who learned fractions in a more standard way.El autor usa el big data para la autoayuda, al hablar de que no debenmos fiarnos de todo lo que la gente pone en Instagram: In fact, I think Big Data can give a twenty-first-century update to a famous self-help quote: “Never compare your insides to everyone else’s outsides.” A Big Data update may be: “Never compare your Google searches to everyone else’s social media posts.”También suelta perlas de humor:February 27, 2000, started as an ordinary day on Google’s Mountain View campus. The sun was shining, the bikers were pedaling, the masseuses were massaging, the employees were hydrating with cucumber water.Y muestra signos de profundidad filosófica: Milan Kundera, the Czech-born writer, has a pithy quote about this in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being: “Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision; we are not granted a second, third or fourth life in which to compare various decisions.”Hay muchas muchas cosas más. ¿Qué diferencias en la vida podemos esperar entre el último admitido y el primer no admitido a una escuela de prestigio? ¿Qué palabras en una petición de un crédito son claro indicador de que la persona es menos proclive a devolverlo? ¿Es lícito usar este conocimiento para denegar créditos?El libro sigue y sigue. Tiene un montón de notas al pie, puestas todas al final (casi un tercio del libro [!!]) y acaba con un alegato a favor del big data: The days of academics devoting months to recruiting a small number of undergrads to perform a single test will come to an end. Instead, academics will utilize digital data to test a few hundred or a few thousand ideas in just a few seconds. We’ll be able to learn a lot more in a lot less time. [...] How do ideas spread? How do new words form? How do words disappear? How do jokes form?Interesantísimo. Divertido. Instructivo. Fantástico. Imprescindible."

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz uses Google Search results, combined with a form of fusion, to give a compelling account of what people actually think.Sociologists dig in garbage to learn about wasted food, and SSD looks at Google search trends--in this case, trends for the N-word--to study privately held racism. These search trends correlate with membership increases and decreases at Stormfront, a white supremacist group. It's worth noting that Stormfront membership increased in some states when Obama was elected president. That increase, btw, was less strongly tied to unemployment or the recession. These states with increased membership voted for Kerry more than Obama and they tended to vote for Trump. Sometimes reading this book was a real drag, to put it mildly.How should we speak to people with opposing views? Don't lecture. Lectures would appear to produce greater stridency. The only thing that maybe works is to provoke curiosity. When President Obama gives a speech about the contributions of people of colour, racist keyword searches go up, but if he says something like, to give one example, ""many of our greatest scientists, artists, and athletes are Muslim,"" people will search for ""Muslim athletes."" How much of an achievement is that? I'm not sure.This was an interesting, sometimes disturbing, book to read just after the Cambridge Analytica ... scandal? (Thing most of us felt was happening?) Everything is being logged.The book would be better if it did not try so hard to capture the wide-eyed ""did you know?!"" tone already cornered by Gladwell and the Freakonomics guys. At times, the naïveté is annoying and even perhaps irresponsible. He notes trends in diction for liberal and conservative outlets, but he shows no familiarity with Haidt's work in this area. He uses a lot of data from pornographic websites and their searches, but he seems under researched in sexuality. He enthusiastically suggests that body parts, images, or words can be revealing data, but he seems to have no clue that literary theorists established all of this decades ago... He is aware that teens lie on surveys, but he sometimes seems not to consider that trolls can influence his search data. He also too often repeats himself, and I often wondered what I would have lost reading the introduction and skipping the rest.Oddly, SSD often says people ""ask"" Google things, but it seems to me that they're searching for either like-minded people or else mentors (by which I mean people who have gone through an experience and reflected on it). For an expert on Google Search, he seems hesitant to suggest that people are using Google to ""search.""I also could have done with slightly less introduction to Big Data. I suspect he's trying to defend his methods, but the claims are bombastic enough that people will pay attention, which I sense is more than enough for most of these number crunchers. Every time an economist says ""it's not about the silver bullet,"" or they mention a ""tool in the toolbox,"" I recall how thrilled they are to find a single powerful predictor like a left ventricle in a race horse. It's tough to sell one of many contributing causes.Finally, is there an explanation why books like these seem so thick and the pages so sparsely used? I assume there is an algorithm that shows people do not like to read books with small fonts and tight spacing as they are lazy or intimidated, but I often look at books like these and conclude from the large font and liberal spacing that the author's claims should be taken with a few extra grains of salt.Freud is mentioned at one point, and this seems appropriate as I tend to associate him with starting the quest to find out what people actually think. I recall that Freud's analysis of dreams quickly became the sort of thing that authors could highjack for characterization. Let's assume that we understand the power of Google searches, what would an army of bots begin doing? It's possible that we've already passed the point that we can trust data of this sort without a great deal of context -- more so than Stephens-Davidowitz demonstrates he can provide here (maybe he'll up his game). Although concerns about the uses of data are mentioned at the end, I nevertheless worry more than the author.Steven Pinker writes the foreword. It's not particularly great by his standards.If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would."
70,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Everybody Lies by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is an interesting book that shows how big-data has proven useful in social science research. In fact, big-data and internet-driven experients are placing the social sciences on a solid mathematical footing. Here's just one example out of the dozens Stephens-Davidowitz gives: Freudian slips. Any lover of science knows that, for all his influence and the positive impact he made de-stigmatizing mental illness, Freud's ideas are not scientific. No one, for instance, has ever observed or isolated an id, ego or superego. His ideas cannot be tested. Or can they? Well, using big data, Stephens-Davidowitz teas through a couple examples, though I'll stick with the slips. Consider this. You're tired, have had a terrible day at work after working a 60-hour week. You're on your way home, and your spouse texts you, asking if you could pick up your son from soccer practice and a pizza for dinner. You beg off, sending this text: Can you do it? Have a headache. Feels as if my head's full of cocks.When you meant to send this: Can you do it? Have a headache. Feels as if my head's full of ROCKS.Freud maintained that these slips are the subconscious bypassing our inner censor. So what does that typo mean? Are you repressing a homosexual urge? Or do you need to take a romantic weekend with your wife? Or are you reacting to your wife's texts as aggressive, the male role, thereby metaphorically copulating with you and filling your head with her metaphorical ****?Or is Freud wrong, and it's just a typo? Because sometimes a typo is just a typo.Well, big data provides the answer. Microsoft Word captures common typos and sends them to Microsoft. Using this data, Stephens-Davidowitz coded a program that created the typos at the same rate as the reported data. He then ran sentences like ""I have a head full of rocks"" through hundreds of iterations in a process called a Monte Carlo simulation. It turned out that the number of times the program typed ""cocks"" instead of ""rocks"" was identical to the number of times real-world Word users changed the word ""cock"" to ""rock.""Ergo, Freudian slips are not the subconscious revolting and ""leaking out."" instead, the data shows them to be processing errors. Neat.Stephens-Davidowitz goes on to discuss the use of data in myriad social science contexts. For instance, he shows that Google data calculating the volume of racist searches in an electoral district related to whether or not Trump won there in the 2016 general election. And uses some interesting porn search data to answer some questions regarding human sexuality in a rigorous way. For instance, his data provides a firmer estimate of the gay population and the dynamics that Red-state/ Blue-state politics have on homosexuals. Which is, of course, that the percentage remains the same (about 5%), but there are more Red-state homosexuals still in the closet. The concepts aren't new — I've been following this trend since reading Duncan Watts a decade ago. Still, this is a solid entry, a sort of 2018 version of Freakonomics. Fun, challenging your assumptions, and a solid look at why and how big data can be used to make the social sciences more meaningful. Four stars. "
71,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2157293-john-fredrickson,3,"I found this to be a book that I wanted to like more than I did. It feels like a survey of ways in which google can be used via phrasal search frequencies, word ngrams, and random other techniques, to shed light on ways in which we deceive ourselves or are deceived. The material is presented with a fair amount of humor. There is an awful lot of good stuff here, but the book felt too casual and somewhat scattered in focus for me. The final chapter is a good example of this - the author pretty much admits that he struggles with developing a good conclusion, then marries this with a statistic that indicates that very few people will read all the way through to the end. I did read it through to the end, and found the conclusion to be disappointing.The author does present a wide variety of 'cases', many of which are meant to be titillating (penis size concerns, vaginal odor concerns, the 'true' ratio of closeted homosexuals, and many more) in the course of showing how one can divine common private concerns of people, despite what is said publicly. Some of the topics, such as ways that wives describe their husbands in one way publicly, while engaging in google searches that belie the public representation, may be quite true in reality, but felt unsupported by the text."
72,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4930019-sara,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - perhaps a tad too many baseball mentions but overall it was fascinating. Google really does know everything!The premiss (focused mostly on America) is to show how Big Data helps us to understand human nature in ways we never have been able to before. Everybody lies (thus the title): to themselves, to pollsters, on social media etc. But home alone with your anonymity and google - what are you typing into that search bar? The millions of searches paint a far more accurate picture of what America hates, likes, enjoys, and thinks about than any other data and that ‘big data’ can be used for lots of good: medical diagnosis, stopping child abuse, proving that attending the best school instead of a solid one actually have little effect on future incomes, etc.An ongoing theme throughout the novel is how big data predicted Trump’s ride to victory on the wave of racism that already existed, not that he created and that really ‘zooming into’ Big Data is where the heaps of information can be found. I hope we get more from this author and his mind-blowing work!"
73,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716255-andrew-breslin,5,"There’s a startling contrast between what people publicly post on social media and what they search for when they naively assume that nobody is watching. As this Google data scientist illustrates with statistically-significant clarity: Americans are much more racist than you might have imagined (before 2016, anyway. It’s sadly obvious now), most parents harbor nagging regrets over having kids, and a lot of closeted gay men in conservative areas ask Google to tell them whether or not they are gay, sometimes within 5 minutes of searching for “hot twink action” on Pornhub. I got off Facebook a few years ago, and I can’t overstate the staggering lack of any regret over doing so. I miss it the way recovering alcoholics miss hangovers. (Not the way they miss booze, mind you, but the way they miss waking up covered in what they hope is their own vomit.) While initially an entertaining distraction, it eventually all seemed nothing but a steaming pile of bullshit. It’s so nice to have my notions not only confirmed and validated, but also quantified.This is a great book. And yes, alabamatoughguy69, you are gay."

I'm a nosy person, so I especially loved taking a deep look into the ""digital truth serum"" of the internet and learning about the statistics behind what people search for online. Besides the juicy details about what is revealed in people's Google searches, this book contains tons of engaging examples of correlations found through looking at big data, about different factors that influence our lives, how advertisers and other corporations use big data to figure out how to hook us more effectively, and the drawbacks and dangers of using big data. There's also a lot of disturbing information about what prompts things like racist Google searches to increase. I found this book super interesting and highly recommend it! I listened to the audiobook, but I would suggest reading the print version instead, as there are a lot of charts and graphs that it would have been nice to look at as I was reading, and the narrator is a bit monotone and really doesn't add anything special to to text.*Used for Read Harder 2018 prompt ""A book of social science."""

I have come to hate their detailed accounts of small experiments that ostensibly prove fundamental principles 0f human nature. What a relief to read in the Conclusion (which was not a mundane summary, but the best part of the book) that:The days of academics devoting months to recruiting a small number of undergrads to perform a single test will come to an end. Instead, academics will utilize digital data to test a few hundred or a few thousand ideas in just a few seconds.

76,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34486838-fred-platten,2,"Sometimes big data is like a rorschach test. You learn more about the person presenting their conclusions than the actual data. This is true with this book. The author really has no idea behind the motivations of people's google searches, but he presents his opinions as facts which I found pretty ridiculous. Especially his conclusion that somehow racist google searches about Obama perfectly explain the reason Trump won the election. That's just a perfectly academic condescending attitude and tells you all you need to know about this author.Some stories are repeated from the book Super Crunchers, which is a far better book than this one.One very good section of the book was about the google searches of gay people in red states which I thought was interesting. More of the book should have been like this."
77,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56007-siah,5,"It is a typical geek book but I truly enjoyed this book. If you work with data, or are a social scientist you should read it. There are a lot of anecdotes that are fun to read but there are plenty of thought provoking ideas too. My only problem with this book is that in many cases it uses the wrong stats terminology. For example the problem of « multiple testing » is referred to as « curse of dimensionality» while these two are very different. There are a few of these examples throughout the book and it is pretty irritating. But even with all of that, the book still makes data science approachable. And it does a great job simplifying very difficult concepts for the audience. This is and enjoyable book. It is dense and took me forever to finish but I enjoyed it immensely. I intend to re read many more times. "
78,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836536-julie-rowse,4,"Fascinating and also a little horrifying. Important read to understand how data is used to influence behaviors. I appreciated that Stephen-Davidowitz acknowledged the myriad ethical implications to consider when using and collecting data. If anything, this book reaffirmed my position that STEM careers cannot exist in a vacuum--we need the humanities alongside STEM to remind us that while data might help us make sense of our world, we aren't robots. Nuance and ethics are still important to our survival as a species."

It got a little redundant and formulaic for me hence why it took me forever to actually finish. There were a few comments that seemed brash and offensive (referring to someone who wants to blow their brains out when talking about suicide) and making light of being cranky in the morning while comparing to suicide. Just seems insensitive and unnecessary. "

The author jumps straight to conclusions and starts laying ""cause"" to outcomes based on a singular, uncontrolled, and merky dataset. Completely and ignorantly ignores the fundamentals of statistics 101. Correlation (especially weak correlation) does not equal causation. This author is a fraud."

He tried to bring interesting case studies and illustrate the power of big data. I think he was successful in this era.

89,0062390856,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954811-barney,2,"This book was fun, but it felt all too often that the conclusions it draws from the data it presented, didn't really follow from the data - or rather, it does to an extent, but with considerations.This is a relevant passage from the book:You might think that a terrorist attack that kills dozens or hundreds of people would automatically be followed by massive, widespread anxiety. Terrorism, by definition, is supposed to instill a sense of terror. I looked at Google searches reflecting anxiety. I tested how much these searches rose in a country the days, weeks, and months following every major European or American terrorist attack since 2004. So, on average, how much did anxiety-related searches rise? They didn't. At all.The book relies heavily on Google search data and draws all sorts of conclusions from them, making the implicit assumption that Google searches follow people's feelings and opinions. It also assumes that people are more honest with Google than with surveys, for various reasons (which I would agree with). However, I would think it's obvious that people's Google searches (and many other such datasets used in the book), often can't follow what people are thinking or feeling very closely. The reason is that Google is a way to research something, or to remember something. People don't Google all of their feelings, thoughts and worries, even though the book posits that they Google more of them than we tend to think*. To illustrate simply, towards the above quote, after a terrorist attack, people might be scared to go to crowded places, they might feel anxious, they might fear for their loved ones safety. I'm not sure any of these necessarily lead to Google searches. People will probably Google the event, they will read about it in the paper, they will adjust their schedules accordingly to perhaps go to the place the event happened to leave flowers, or avoid it altogether out of fear. They might make an extra appointment with their therapist, or call their parents or their friends. They might even Google something (like the way to the place of the event). But lack of Google searches related to anxiety does not mean a lack of anxiety.A classic (albeit simplistic) example is the amounts of Google search results for ""gay sex"" compared to those for ""straight sex"". ""gay sex"" returns about 30% more results than ""straight sex"" as of the time of this writing. Does that mean people have a lot more gay sex than straight sex? Or that people think a lot more about gay sex than straight sex? No. Partly, this can be explained by the fact that straight people probably don't qualify their searches with ""straight"". They largely search for ""sex"". Or, well, they search for something more specific, as Googling for ""sex"" probably isn't something people do when they think about sex.Similarly, there was another passage conjecturing about suicide, which mentioned the rates at which people Google searches related to suicide. The chapter also talked about how actual suicide rates are far lower than Googling for suicide, which means many people consider it without following up. To which I immediately think of many ways the group of people considering suicide and that of people Googling suicide can diverge: some people just Google suicide or ways to commit suicide out of curiosity. Some, who actually consider suicide, will Google it a couple of times, and then find information on it which they can keep - and thus not have to Google for it again. In general, when people Google, they often find a community or a website which can solve their questions on something that interests them, and they bookmark or subscribe to that website. Or they keep the information and don't need to ask Google about it again.It's a bit like measuring how many times a certain theatre is visited, using a dataset with all the occasions where people ask someone on the street for directions.One can claim that people mostly don't ask for directions anymore (probably because they can Google their way to the theatre). Thus, my comparison is unfair, as people Google their thoughts a lot more than they ask for directions.This highlights my opinion on the matter: do we really know to which extent people Google their thoughts? Is it the same per topic? One thing is for sure: there's a lot of phenomena that explain why real life conditions cannot be construed from Google searches, and until these can be measured, quantified or explained away, any conclusions drawn from such data is inaccurate in unspecified ways, and shouldn't be trusted.All in all, read this book because it presents fun data. Don't expect much from the conclusions.* some people, for example, simply Google ""is my husband gay"", which is clearly something Google cannot answer for that specific husband, but simply reveals what this person worries about."
