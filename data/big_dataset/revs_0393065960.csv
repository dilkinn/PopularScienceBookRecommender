0,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"I had a lot of fun reading this book up until the end, when I started to worry about the author's propensity towards exaggeration and speculation.For anyone who wants to learn about cutting edge speculation on the origin of life, Eukaryotas, and sex, it's definitely worth a read!Anyone allergic to new-age nonsense sociology, just skip the last 9th chapter.Everyone should take the last chapter with a very large grain of salt, because it's full of speculation, overblown claims, and other lies.1. The Origin of LifeThe author is obsessed with hydrothermal vents.The evidence for life's origin in hydrothermal vents is overstated as fact, despite its true status as a highly speculative theory.2. DNAI was astounded to learn that the evolution of the genetic code (which RNA sequences code for which amino acids) arose only once,but the machinery for DNA replication arose twice, independently! Once in the archaea, and once for all the others.Though, the crucial evidence in the argument is the interpenetration of the DNA replication genes as a molecular clock.The author carefully hides the error margin for this method of dating, which approaches unity when applied to organisms capable of lateral genetic exchange.Still, it is curious that the whole machinery of DNA replication seems to follow two, reportedly distinct, paradigms.3. PhotosynthesisThe textbook story of photosynthesis is exposed as a gross over-simplification.A more detailed, but again speculative, re-telling is a neat story of long-lost cousins exchanging DNA.Not as incestuous as it sounds... 4. The complex cellLike photosynthesis, the story ends up being quite involved compared to the high-school biology explanation.To me, the most interesting insight is the theorized reason for a cell nucleus: to provide a barrier to transposons.The porous nuclear acts as a speed bump, allowing time for transposons to be broken down before traveling out to the mitochondria.Cool stuff!5. SexWhat is it good for?This chapter was pretty hot, but nothing I didn't learn in High School.Get your mind out of the gutter! I was talking about AP Biology!6. MovementLots of talk about muscles, and, as usual, some neat surprises.7. SightYes, I'd rather half an eye than no eye at all.Brine shrimp come to the rescue as a supreme example in support of evolution.8. Hot BloodWere the dinosaurs hot blooded?What makes ""hot"" vs. ""cold"" blood?The answers may bore you...I'm half joking, because this chapter was full of interesting theories, too.But I could care less for paleontological bickering.9. ConsciousnessThis chapter is full of half-baked (and worse) philosophy, on top of misunderstandings on basic lessons from physics.For example: ""we don't even know ... why matter exists, rather than nothing at all""This is an atrocious misunderstanding of physics.See A Universe from Nothing by Lawrence Krauss.The most frightening digression in this chapter was the authors claim that ""panpsychism is taken seriously again"".He touts Graham Cairns-Smith's ""bomb in the basement"" dualist argument. (Boo! Hiss!)Yes, this chapter, in a modern biology book, contains a ""serious"" claim of DUALISM!!The orgy of ignorance continues as the author asserts ""we don't even understand how quantum mechanics works"".He goes on to claim that quantum physics leaves room for free will and a soul.It's a good thing I listened to the formless audiobook, or I'd have had a bonfire right then and there.But I had the misfortune to be in the middle of my commute to work, so I kept reading.I tried to find my happy place during some talk of ""consciousness as quantum vibrations"".Then, I wept aloud at the mention of a particle source of feelings which might be discovered in the particle accelerators.Obviously, the wiring and behavior of the brain's neural network is the source of mind and feelings.Nick Lane should stick to biology, he hasn't the background to discuss physics.10. DeathFollowing the chapter on consciousness, I had little patience left.This chapter is about how death works and how we can overcome it.The author seems pretty set in his Ray Kurzweil like denial of the inevitability of death.It is claimed multiple times that death is simple and can be prevented biochemically.The chapter focuses chiefly on the hype surrounding the TOR gene.It's really not worth reading unless you're a fan of popular (i.e. mythological) pharmacology.There is some interesting theorizing as to the evolutionary cause of aging and death.Strangely, there is NO MENTION of the primary cause of aging: telomere shortening.The primary defense against cancer our body uses is a fixed number of cellular replications.This ensures that, unless or until malignancy is achieved, tumors eventually stop growing.The replication limit on stem cells produces a finite lifetime to enjoy tissue repair.It seems obvious to me that reduced quality and speed of tissue repair and replacement amount to the symptoms of aging.Nick Lane either has never heard of telomeres, or has chosen to deceive the reader by leaving them out."
1,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"Excellent pop science writing, as absorbing as a novel (I read it in two days). The author has a knack for compelling narrative flow that seems both natural, and accumulating to some sense of Getting Somewhere by the end, always very satisfying.Lots of new things from recent (and less recent) research that I hadn't yet heard about, which was much of what I was hoping for from this book. It also gives, in passing along the way, a good sense of how science itself evolves. Wow has biology ever advanced since I was in college. (I credit the computer, even more than the new scanning techs. Mass DNA crunching, with all the new data it is revealing, would be impossible without it.)One kudo deducted for describing Watson and Crick without giving credit by name to Rosalind Franklin, which would only have taken a clause. Half a clause. ""and a few pilfered X-ray diffraction photos"" --> ""and a few X-ray diffraction photos pilfered from Rosalind Franklin"" would have done just that little bit towards righting an old wrong. I had been rather hoping Lane would do for photosynthesis the sort of lucid and detailed explanation he'd done for mitochondria in his prior title, but since it only had a chapter and not a whole volume, we only got as far as ""lucid"". He did offer a book rec for further reading on the topic, Eating the Sun which, ha, my county library has and therefore so will I, shortly, so that's promising.Highly recommended for general readers.Ta, L."
2,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"What were the ten greatest inventions of evolution? According to Nick Lane, author of Life Ascending, they were the Origin of Life itself, DNA, Photosynthesis, The Complex Cell, Sex, Movement, Sight, Hot Blood, Consciousness, and Death. It’s a pretty good list. I thought about it and could not come up with any substitutions.The origins of life are arguably not evolutionary science at all, but a separate field called abiogenesis. Nevertheless, this book’s chapter on how life started is one of its best, making a good argument that life may have begun in the deep ocean, not in the well known “hot smoker” vents, but in cooler, longer lived alkaline hydrothermal vents, which precipitate a form of rock that is riddled with tiny pockets about the size of a cell, that could have served to concentrate and protect the chemical precursors necessary to light the spark of life. When all the components were ready it probably happened quickly.if any reaction takes a millennium to complete, then the chances are that all the reactants will simply dissipate or break down in the meantime, unless they are continually replenished by other, faster, reactions. The origin of life was certainly a matter of chemistry, so the same logic applies: the basic reactions of life must have taken place spontaneously and quickly.To say that life “happened” requires some further clarification. The chemical processes necessary to create a living cell may have occurred many times given the similarities of the environment that birthed them, but to truly be life the organism also needed a way to survive and reproduce, and it was that bit of chemistry that set life in motion. “It is certainly true that natural selection can’t work without some sort of replicator; and it is equally true that life can only evolve complexity through the auspices of natural selection. For many molecular biologists, then, the origin of life is the origin of replication.”From the origin of life the book moves on to DNA, and the author has provided a number of examples to help the reader understand.Each [DNA] letter is copied with a precision bordering on the miraculous, recreating the order of the original with an error rate of about one letter in 1,000 million. In comparison, for a scribe to work with a similar precision, he would need to copy out the entire bible 280 times before making a single error. In fact, the scribes’ success was a lot lower. There are said to be 24,000 surviving manuscript copies of the New Testament, and no two copies are identical.Nevertheless, even with the astonishing fidelity of DNA replication, errors appear among each cell’s three billion base pairs in the human genome when it divides.Each time a human cell divides, you’d expect to see about three mutations per set of chromosomes. And the more times that a cell divides, the more such mutations accumulate, ultimately contributing to diseases like cancer. Mutations also cross generations. If a fertilised egg develops as a female embryo, it takes about thirty rounds of cell division to form a new egg cell; and each round adds a few more mutations. Men are even worse: a hundred rounds of cell division are needed to make sperm, with each round linked inexorably to more mutations. Because sperm production goes on throughout life, round after round of cell division, the older the man, the worse it gets.Extrapolating from this, we see that “even an average child, of youthful parents, has around 200 new mutations compared with their parents (although only a handful of these may be directly harmful).”The idea of copying errors can be extended further, to add insight into the evolution of species.Assuming that humans split off from our common ancestor with chimps around 6 million years ago, and accumulated mutations at the rate of 200 per generation ever since, we’ve still only had time to modify about 1 per cent of our genome in the time available. As chimps have been evolving at a similar rate, theoretically we should expect to see a 2 per cent difference. In fact the difference is a little less than that; in terms of DNA sequence, chimps and humans are around 98.6 per cent identical.The book then moves into photosynthesis, the foundation for the evolution of complex life everywhere. “All our energy is a beam of sunlight set free from its captive state in food.” Since photosynthesis is often held up by creationists as an example of special creation (as in “what good is half an eye, or half a wing?”), the book has a good description of the steps involved, examining them at the level of chemistry and physics to explain how energy is stored and released, and how even the precursor reactions to full blown photosynthesis would have been beneficial. The end state is marvelously complex but also an incredibly inefficient Rube Goldberg contraption that wastes about 96% of the potential energy – in other words, it is exactly the type of process evolution would evolve, since it cannot be forward looking, and can only work with what it has at the present moment, preserving the changes that work and discarding those that do not.Like life itself, complex eukaryotic cells seem to have emerged from a chance encounter. “The eukaryotic cell only evolved once because the union of two prokaryotes, in which one gains entry to another, is truly a rare event, a genuinely fateful encounter. All that we hold dear in this life, all the marvels of our world, stem from a single event that embodied both chance and necessity.” The author examines several theories for its appearance, and settles on one that posits an accidental combination of two primitive cells. “the eukaryotic cell did not evolve in a standard ‘Darwinian’ way, but rather by some sort of mammoth gene fusion. From a genetic point of view, the first eukaryote was a chimera–half archaea, half bacteria.” In this scenario, each of the key cellular organelles, such as the nucleus, the cell wall, and mitochondria, were pulled into the cell and established themselves without being consumed; once established they created a symbiotic relationship among themselves to become the vastly more efficient modern eukaryotic cell.The chapter on sex starts the reader down a rabbit hole of speculation that it is an absurdly expensive and questionable process that should never have evolved in the first place. “Most of us sense that the magic of sex (as a form of reproduction) lies in exactly this ability to generate variation, to pull a unique being from a hat every time. But when scrutinised with the care of a mathematical geneticist, it is far from obvious that variety for variety’s sake is a good thing. Why break up a winning combination; why not just clone it?”The argument that sex improves species because each new offspring is a new roll of the genetic dice is also shown to be weak. “sex in itself doesn’t introduce any new variation to a population. Without mutation, sex merely shuffles existing genes around, removing the bad ones as it goes, thereby ultimately restricting variation.”So what is it good for? The author argues that it is essential to stay one step ahead of parasites. “Sex helps because parasites evolve rapidly: they have short lifespans and heaving populations. It doesn’t take them long to adapt to their host at the most intimate molecular scale–protein to protein, gene to gene. Failure to do so costs them their life; success gives them the freedom to grow and replicate.”The next three chapters are on Movement, Sight, and Hot Blood. All are interesting, particularly in the examples the author provides to expand upon his arguments, but most readers already familiar with evolution will not find any great insights in them.The book ends with chapters on Consciousness and on Death which, for us thinking beings are inextricably linked. “The mind is conscious only when it becomes aware that it is conscious: when the penny drops.” Once we think about it we realize that life is a trap with no way out. “Adjust the ‘death’ settings, to make cell death less likely, and the outcome is cancerous, unstoppable growth. But make cell death too likely and the outcome is a withering away. Cancer and degeneration are two sides of the same coin: both undermine multicellular life.”Anyone familiar with evolution knows that it is “concerned” – an overly anthropomorphic term – only with passing along genes, which means improving survival chances so that organisms can reach reproductive age. Once past the age of reproduction evolution is powerless to further enhance survival fitness because there is no way to pass along any beneficial traits. The author uses a good example to explain this:there is a statistical likelihood of death regardless of ageing–of being hit by a bus, or a stone falling from the sky, or being eaten by a tiger, or consumed by disease. Even if you are immortal you are unlikely to live forever. Individuals who concentrate their reproductive resources in the earlier part of their life are therefore statistically more likely to have more offspring than individuals who count on an unhurried schedule, reproducing, say, once every 500 years or so, and regrettably losing their head after only 450. Cram in more sex earlier on and you’ll probably leave behind more offspring, who inherit your ‘sex-early’ genes,We humans are not built to last; for each life we owe a death. We can tweak the system, making minor adjustments to the average life span, but in the end we were not built for long lives. Errors creep into our DNA replication, which are themselves repeated with further errors. Eventually the mechanism jams, the critical systems that ensure programmed cell death fail, and cancer carries us away. If not cancer, some other vital cellular management function breaks down and does us in. Long lives or short, we can only try to make the most of life for as long as we have it. Marcus Aurelius, emperor and stoic, would simply shrug his shoulders and say that we should care about the things that are within our power to affect, and not worry about what we cannot change.I enjoyed this book. It is well written for readers with a general interest in evolution; the chemistry and physics are kept to a minimum and explained using simple examples. I learned a number of things from it, and it helped point me toward new areas of evolutionary study that I want to explore."
3,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,"An excellent book that really delves into the biochemical reasons for things being as they are in nature. From the origin of life in alkaline vents surrounded by sea water creating organic compounds to the evolutionary reasoning behind the existence of death itself, originating from the process of apoptosis (cellular suicide) in bacterial prehistory to curb bacteriophage infections. This book is an excellent introduction into the chemistry of life and the various major fields of study where research has been undertaken to explain the origin of biological features we all take for granted. If you pick this book up, heads-up : some sections of the book may seem overtly technical when they begin but if you continue on, the argument will be very clear soon enough. The author ensures that the reader untrained in biochemistry would retain the core argument before utilising it to explain something far-reaching or salient that deeply pertains to life as we know it. Highly recommended."

If you like a book that delves deep into every tiny detail, this is the book for you. If things like ATP, leaky mitochondria, bacteria that can live in strange conditions, how DNA was discovered (and how Crick thought aliens put it on Earth), you will enjoy Lane's wonderful adventure of how life came to be. The science in this book was outstanding. "
5,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867502-jennifer,3,"I found this to be a mixed bag. I found some chapters such as Complex Cells and Hot Blood fascinating and others such as Movement and Consciousness quite tedious. The author does a good job of reducing complex biological processes into simpler terms but I felt he used weird analogies far too often to illustrate his point. When he started comparing muscle proteins into classical music I had to roll my eyes. In addition, a few more illustrations would be useful to show some concepts.It was nice to catch up on recent discoveries and see how much the science has progressed since I last studied biology which was in high school and first year university fifteen years ago.

He explains various techniques for discovering the information in a way I could understand.I admit that in some places I lost him but overall, the read is interesting and educational.“Men are even worse: a hundred rounds of cell division are needed to make sperm, with each round linked inexorably to more mutations. Because sperm production goes on throughout life, round after round of cell division, the older the man, the worse it gets. As the geneticist James Crow put it, the greatest mutational health hazard in the population is fertile old men.” “Life itself turned our planet blue and green, as tiny photosynthetic bacteria cleansed the oceans of air and sea, and filled them with oxygen. Powered by this new and potent source of energy, life erupted. Flowers bloom and beckon, intricate corals hide darting gold fish, vast monsters lurk in black depths, trees reach for the sky, animals buzz and lumber and see. And in the midst of it all, we are moved by the untold mysteries of this creation, we cosmic assemblies of molecules that feel and think and marvel and wonder at how we came to be here.” "
8,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6303343-sne,5,"Before reading Nick Lane I have never had interest in Biology. I didn't even watch Animal Planet. And for a month now I can't stop talking about mitochondria, DNA, evolution, etc.His books are fascinating. I like the way he structures his statements, his sense of humor, the analogies he makes, the notions that start floating in your head. I like that he obviously likes The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy :)Somebody here has said that he is speculating too much with unproved theories. May be because I'm not a scientist, but I don't mind. I think that he is giving a fair warning every time he is speculating about something."

10,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,5,"How do I love this book? Let me count the ways ...I love Nick Lane's tone, which manages to balance wit and clarity without overusing the analogy button:Thermodynamics is one of those words best avoided in a book with any pretence to be popular, but it's more engaging if it's seen for what it is: the science of 'desire'. The existence of atoms and molecules is dominated by 'attractions', 'repulsions', 'wants' and 'discharges', to the point that it becomes virtually impossible to write about chemistry without giving in to some sort of randy anthropomorphism. Molecules 'want' to lose or gain electrons; attract opposite charges, repulse similar charges; or cohabit with molecules of similar character. A chemical reaction happens spontaneously if all the molecular partners desire to participate; or they can be pressed to react unwillingly through greater force. And of course some molecules really want to react but find it hard to overcome their innate shyness. A little gentle flirtation might prompt a massive release of lust, a discharge of pure energy. But perhaps I should stop there.I love him because he blew my little mind. Lane begins with the origins of life, deep in the mineral-rich sea, on alkaline vents on the sea floor. How life on Earth began is still not entirely agreed upon, but Lane has thrown his lot in with biochemists Martin Russell and Mike Russell: If Martin and Russell are right - and I think they are - [the Last Universal Common Ancestor] was not a free-living cell but a rocky labyrinth of mineral cells, lined with catalytic walls composed of iron, sulphur and nickle, and energised by natural proton gradients. The first life was a porous rock that generated complex molecules and energy, right up to the formation of proteins and DNA itself.Rocks. We all come from rocks. It's almost too big an idea to hold in your head at one time. (This all causes me to ask why I hadn't wondered where life came from before. I know how planets formed, and beyond that I think I had some hazy notion of 'primordial ooze', which is apparently discredited). With the next chapter, DNA, I was on steadier ground. I was back with some familiar friends - (hello Watson and Crick) and knew what was happening. There's some lovely passages in this chapter too:Crick pictured messenger RNA just sitting in the cytoplasm with its codons projecting like a sow's nipples, each one ready to bind its transfer RNA like a suckling pig. Eventually all the tRNAs would nestle up, side by side down the full length of the messenger RNA, with their amino acids projecting out like the tails of piglets, ready to be zipped up into a protein.[It's probably worth noting here that Lane is explaining why Crick's theory was wrong, not right.]I love the structure of the book. Lane slowly builds up from rocks to DNA to photosynthesis to sex to sight to hot blood to death and consciousness, at each point asking why these things were invented - what evolutionary advantage they offer, and what their histories are (or might be). Each chapter reaches back to the ones before, and often signals developments further within itself. Each is filled with those small details that make you realise that you know nothing - which makes you feel *terrific*. [Sincerely, is there anything better than realising you have years and years and books and books on a fascinating topic ahead of you?]. Sight was the surprise winner chapter for me. Sight - in the form of light-sensitive areas - first appeared in the form of naked retinas, a light sensitive sheet of cells that still appear on some of the creatures, like the swarming shrimp, that live near the vents where life (may have) originally appeared. It is possible that eyes triggered the entire Cambrian explosion, the point when most modern Phyla emerged. We're used to thinking of the lens of the eye as a disk of transparent cells - the tribolite's lens were made of the mineral calcite - another name for calcium carbonate, which in an impure form is limestone and a purer form is chalk. One living creature, the brittlestar, still uses calcite to make its lenses. Most of all though, I love that Lane shows us the process of science - the areas where things aren't settled, the places with scientists disagree, the ways that personalities can conflict with credibility. He sketches out both theories and the people who devised them. For example - there has been significant debate over whether life originated in 'black smokers' or alkaline vents (mentioned earlier). Günter Wächtershäuser, a German chemist and patent attorney, advanced the black smoker theory, hypothesising that the key materials of life were hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide and iron pyrites: One scientist, on first reading Wächtershäuser's wok, remarked that it felt like stumbling across a scientific paper that had fallen through a time warp from the end of the twenty-first century.But is he right? Harsh criticism has been levelled at Wächtershäuser too, in part because he is a genuine revolutionary, overturning long-cherished ideas; in part, because his haughty manner tends to exasperate fellow scientists; and in part, because there are legitimate misgivings about the picture he paints.Another example, from the chapter on the complex cell:In the face of little solid evidence, I'd like to raise another gloriously imaginative hypothesis from the ingenious duo we met in Chapter 2, Bill Martin and Eugene Koonin. Their idea has two great merits. It explains why a nucleus should evolve specifically in a chimeric cell, notably one that is half archaea, half bacteria (which, as we've seen, is the most believable origin of the eukaryotic cell itself). And it explains why the nuclei of virtually all eukarytoic cells should be stuffed with DNA coding for nothing, completely unlike bacteria. Even if the idea is wrong, I think it's the kind of thing we ought to be looking for, and it still raises a real problem facing the early eukaryotes that has to be solved somehow. This is the sort of idea that adds magic to science, and I hope it is right. With the idiotic debates that continue to be pursued around evolution and 'intelligent design', I think it is crucial that society understands that 'gaps' in the evidence, and disagreements among scientists, do not weaken the case for evolution (which should, really, not have to be made). Lane does an elegant and enjoyable job of laying out the current state of research, focused on topics he cares about and finds intriguing, and even though I'm going to have to read the book again in order to fully understand it, I am truly grateful to him for doing so."
11,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/977414-dr-carl-ludwig-dorsch,2,"Nick Lane is a self-described evolutionary biochemist and presently Senior Lecturer in the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at University College London. His Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution was awarded the 2010 Royal Society Prize for Science Books. He has previously published Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World and Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life. His What is Living? Why Energy Drives the Origin and Evolution of Life is expected in 2014.In Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution Lane focuses on the inventing rather than the inventions, the origination, the birth of the thing rather than its life. And biological understanding being what it is, this leads him, from the very beginning (The Origin of Life) to the search for precursors. The subsequent deployment, operation, and implications of the enumerated “inventions,” though not entirely ignored, are not really the purview here. For example:If the railroad happened to be one of Lane’s “Ten Great Inventions of Evolution”, there would be much about ancient Greek wheel-rut roads (including those in Sicily and Cyrenica), noting their consistent depth of 7 to 15 centimeters, their rut width of 20 to 22 centimeters and gauge of 138 to144 centimeters. Mention would be made of rut sidings, allowing vehicles to pass where only a single rut is available. These Greek rut-roads might be compared with those cut into Vespasian’s tunnel at Bons (in that segment of the Via Flamina known as Petra Pertusa) where the gauges ranged from 110 to 165 centimeters.Further extended discussion would be had of Greek cartage, and the sometimes unclear distinction between the hamaxa and the hamaxa tetrakulos – two and four wheeled carts – this in the context of the inappropriateness of the hamaxa tetrakulos for travel on wheel-rut roads, unless, of course, they possessed a swiveling front axle. Which in turn would lead to a discussion of the development of the bogie, or turning-train, the mechanism by which, through first attaching the front wheels of a cart or wagon to its shaft and only then to the chassis by way of a pivot, the front wheels of a four wheeled vehicle may turn independently – and how this, though used by the Celts before the Common Era, only came into fuller use in the Middle Ages, perhaps encouraged by the needs of steerable four wheeled battering rams, propelled from the rear.Eventually we would come to a discussion of mining technology, and mining trucks running on wooden rails in the middle of the European millennium, and then even more eventually to metal clad wood rails, then to iron and steel, then the history of steam engines (with emphasis on the Greek aeopile), etc., etc.What we would not get from Lane however would be a discussion of the economic and political imperatives which drove, in fairly short order, the spanning of the terrestrial planet with a network of rail lines. Nor would we likely find much consideration of the resultant transformation of world’s social, economic and political culture (not to mention the matériel of its industrial base, from fossil fuels to forestry to metallurgy), or of the railroad’s relation to the various imperialist projects on all the world’s inhabited continents, or to the great European wars of the 20th century, or even to the telegraph (though we might have an amusing aside on Railroad Time and the institution of time zones).And we fairly certainly would not find any mention of the various other technical and social transformations which occurred in partial causal tandem with railroad development, like the iron and steel transformation of the advanced metropolitan urban environment, and most certainly nothing of rail’s still shifting relation to a subsequent high-speed pavement-based internal combustion culture (or to air traffic and air freight, for that matter), etc. Of course even a 28 page essay (the average length of those in Life Ascending) on the invention of the railroad, if that invention were indeed to be offered as one of the 10 most pivotal in the course of human history, would have to have its limits. One makes choices. I only offer the preceding to illustrate the sort of choices Life Ascending makes.That essential frustration aside (and, admittedly other smaller and perhaps related complaints – though I cannot help but note here Lane’s consistent propensity to flog his own favorite contemporary evolutionary speculations while only vaguely qualifying their standing relative to the current consensus), I found the volume a useful hint at an early 21st century biochemical perspective. Dr. Lane is a biochemist; I have not even the faintest grasp of the fact of the three? four? five? 103? 118? a possible 155? elements. He’s got me thinking about the phase problem in x-ray (particularly protein) crystallography and transposons, I’ll grant him that."
12,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,5,"One can study the biochemistry of photosynthesis in some detail and be unaware of the different pathways that exist and existed in different organisms, of its effect on the color of the sky, of its effect on the structural components of large plants and animals, and of the peculiarities of its evolutionary origin. Nick Lane gives a brilliant overview of the nature, significance and origin of the 10 greatest inventions of evolution including, the origin of life itself, DNA, photosynthesis, the eukaryotes, sex, movement, sight, warm bloodedness (homeothermy), consciousness, and death. I found the degree of detail to fit well with the text's readability and I was uniformly impressed with the author's knowledge and presentation. The relative low point, for me, was the chapter on consciousness. There is a great deal of interest there, but I think I am a little more radical than the author on this topic; he blows off Dennett with a single paragraph and he ends his discussion of the tragic case of a girl with hydranencephaly by stating that if it is the case that if the roots of consciousness are not to be found in the cerebral cortex, ""then the neural transform, from firing to feeling, loses some of its mystique"". Yes, that's what Dennett says, and it loses  all  of its mystique."

The ten inventions are examined in detail from an evolutionary perspective, providing the latest knowledge and current theories as to how and when each evolved. Super engaging.Chapter 1 - The Origin of LifeIt appears that life started in the alkaline sea floor vents where seawater reacts with newly exposed rocks, creating the mineral serpentine. A steady supply of hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide to form organic molecules (reverse Kreb cycle). The porous structure of serpentine concentrates the reactions. The spontaneous production of an ATP precursor in the serpentine pores would drive the Kreb cycle.Chapter 2 - DNALane details the various steps after the discovery of DNA, in understanding it's code. The first letter of the code relates to the precursor that forms the amino acid. The second letter relates to whether the amino acid is hydrophilic or water soluble. The third letter is degenerate in that many letter combinations yield the same amino acid. It is suggested that at one time it was a two letter code giving 15 amino acids, that evolved into a three letter code giving 20. Lane goes on to show how RNA would have formed in the undersea vents, and led to the creation of DNA.While bacteria and eubacteria both arose from the vents and share the same genetic code, they differ in the enzymes used in DNA replication. DNA replication appears to have evolved twice. Prior to DNA replication, it may be that replication was through RNA using a process similar to that of retro-viruses. DNA evolved as it had a great advantage of stability.Chapter 3 - PhotosynthesisWhile photosynthesis creates organic molecules using carbon dioxide and water, respiration is the opposite process. The oxygen surplus on earth is due to the burial of plant matter. While relatively constant over recent time, the rate of carbon burial in the Carboniferous period lead to oxygen concentrations above 30%, allowing animals like dragonflies to become huge. Rapid burials are largely due to volcanic activity.In photosynthesis, the oxygen is released from water, not carbon dioxide. It is a two step process (two photosystems) with one photon energizing an electron to produce ATP, and a second process where the electron re-energizes the electron to convert carbon dioxide to a sugar. A complex process is needed to overcome the stability of both CO2 and water molecules.Plant chloroplasts were once free-living cyanobacteria.Both photosystems arose from a single ancestor. Some bacteria have one photosystem, while others have the second. How they became linked is not known but one theory is that an early bacteria possessed both photosystems and used them under different conditions. This would have lead to situations where the first system would produce too many electrons and the second would need electrons. A single evolutionary step would allow both systems to operate, giving the two step process.The oxygen evolving step (part of the first photosystem) is done with a four manganese atom structure. This inorganic ""oxygen evolving complex"" probably formed in the vents and was utilized by early cyanobacteria. Researchers are now trying to duplicate it for use in using solar energy tp separate water into oxygen and hydrogen.Chapter 4 - The Complex CellEukaryotic cells possess a nucleus, and are much more complex than bacteria. All eukaryotes share common genetics, showing that complex life arose from bacteria only once. Bacteria were the only lifeform for 3 billion years, with the eukaryotes arising only 600 mya.The eukaryotes have more commonality with the Archaea than the Bacteria, in their proteins, gene replication process and protein formation. Understanding evolution of eukaryote cells is difficult as lateral gene transfer and whole genome fusions cloud the gradual evolution processes. Two theories are current. In the first, the primitive cell evolves the characteristics of eukaryotes, then consumed a bacterium to form the mitochondria. The second sees the fusion of two prokaryote cells. Lane characterizes this as ""a rare and fortuitous event"".Eukaryotes have numerous sequences on non-coding sequences called introns. These are the remains of jumping genes, and make up half of the human genome. Prokaryotes are able to cut jumping genes out, although the mechanism is not known. Most of these appear to have been accumulated by the early ancestor of eukaryotes. The introns appear to be an advantage to eukaryotes in adding a source of variation and allowing more complex processes to evolve.Chapter 5 - SexDespite being a difficult and somewhat costly process, sex is almost universal among complex lifeforms. Sex allows favorable mutations to spread through a population more quickly, but also allows the purging of unfavorable mutations. Lane reviews past and current theories of the mechanisms providing these advantages.Chapter 6 - MovementMotility has transformed life, increasing the complexity of ecosystems and the pace of evolution.Muscle contraction is due to long filaments of actin and myosin. Myosin cross-bridges bind to ATP and swing to a new position before re-attaching to the actin and releasing the fragments of the ATP. There is variation in the speed of myosin processes with smaller animals having faster processes. Mice are three times faster than humans, rats twice and tortoises one-twentieth. While the evolution of muscle has been detailed, the origin of movement is yet unclear.Chapter 7 - SightThe eye has developed many times. While the octopus design seems to be more straightforward with the retina at the back, the human eye has better blood supply to the receptors allowing greater processing of the pigments. The human eye uses more energy than the brain on a unit weight basis.Eyes developed rapidly during the Cambrian explosion, with the first lenses appearing in the trilobites. The lens is the most ""difficult"" step in the evolution of the eye. Trilobites (and modern brittle stars) used calcite, which naturally crystallizes into a rhombic form that passes light in one direction. However, most animals have lenses made from proteins called crystallins that were co-opted from other uses in the body.Virtually all creatures use rhodopsin in their retinas. It appears that the photoreceptor cell evolved only once. Small changes in the structure of opsins can change their absorption of light through the range of red to UV. Attempts to replicate the ancestral protein indicate it was receptive to UV.The algae Volvox uses rhodopsin to sense light. The facility probably came from chloroplasts.Chapter 8 - Hot BloodHot blood allows animals to generate more power. Each increase of 10 deg C doubles the power output. Moreover, they has much greater stamina.Large animals are effectively hot blooded because their large volume to surface area retains heat.Hot blood has the large cost of eating. A mammal consumes 30 times the food used by a lizard of similar size. A primary benefit is stamina. Whenever a lizard runs, it is anaerobically, requiring a resting period.In most animals the m maximum metabolic rate is about ten times the resting rate. It is not known why this is the case. Some exceptions include the Pronghorn at 65 times and the Alligator at 40 times.Hot blooded animals have larger internal organs that are packed with more mitochondria. This appears to aid the power and stamina advantages, but also cause the higher resting metabolism.In the early Triassic lystrosaurs dominated, representing 95% of all terrestrial vertebrates. Later in the Triassic, cynodonts started to displace the lytosaurs. While lytrosaurs were herbaceous, some of the cynodonts were carnivores and shown signs of hot blood.Therapods show signs of the highly efficient breathing system possessed by the birds, which allows air to be passed over the lungs during both inhalation and exhalation. Birds acn extracted two or three times as much oxygen from rarefied air as can mammals.Chapter 9 - ConsciousnessDiscussion on possibilities for the neural basis of consciousness.Chapter 10 - DeathThe diseases of old age appear to be tied to specific genes, suggesting that they are generally caused by a specific pathway. A single fix to sure a pathway provides the possibility of curing diseases of old age in general. There is a trade-off between sex and longevity. Calorie reduced diets turn off the sex drive.Free radicals are central to cell signaling. The use of anti-oxidants to reduce free radicals does not work as the body excretes them, maintaining the free radicals at the proper level. Lifespan varies with free radical leak in all species. While a rat and a pigeon have similar metabolisms, the pigeon lives ten times longer.As we age, the mitochondrial populations wear out and the free radical leak creeps up. The increased signaling gives rise to a chronic, mild inflammation that characterizes many of the diseases of old age, A DNA variant has been found in some Japanese that causes a tiny reduction in free radical leak. By the age of 80, half as many of those with the variant are likely to arrive in a hospital. Those with the variant are twice as likely to reach 100. The idea of a cure for any of the diseases of old age may be ""... missing the wood for the trees"", as it may be more fruitful to examine the underlying mechanisms of aging."

In a survey of the history of life on earth, the author comes out with ten events, or rather inventions in his parlance, that thoroughly changed the course of life and diverted it into the highway leading to complex organisms like mammals and men. Development of the complex cell, sight, power of movement and sex constitute a few of the characteristics identified by the author. With his judicious selection of parameters, Nick Lane has presented a well balanced picture of the state of things. Being a scholar of biochemistry who has authored many books and articles on the subject, Lane excels in portraying what he knows best in flowery detail. He was awarded the Biochemical Society Award in 2015 for his achievements and the book itself has bagged many honours.Picking out ten identifying features from a bewildering array of organisms with infinitely variable features is a herculean task, that can’t be undertaken without a solid structure for the investigation and proper methods of analysis. The author identifies four criteria for selecting the phenomena that is included in the text. The first one is quite obvious – it should be revolutionary in function, taking place on a global scale so as to affect the growth of life as a whole. Another benchmark is that the phenomenon must still be existing. There is indeed no point in singing the praise of a creature that was extinct long ago because it lacked the ability to adapt to changing environment. Evolution by natural selection alone is taken to be the third factor in which cultural selection is ruled out as it came rather late in the history of life on this planet. In a discussion rooted on the basics of emergence of life, anything other than natural selection need not be considered. The final parameter selected by Nick Lane is that the evolutionary development should be iconic. This term is rather vague, even though it is justified in the text. An iconic transformation is bound to be revolutionary too, and vice versa. So, what is the difference between it and the first one? Whatever may be Lane’s arguments to the contrary, readers get an impression that the fourth point is a redundant one.Secrets behind the origin of life are presented from a chemist’s point of view. One important aspect visible here is the scrapping of Darwin’s famous idea of the ‘primordial soup’, the warm puddle that was thought to be the cradle of life. Darwinists posit that life originated in those primordial pools of warm water in which amino acids and proteins abounded. Lane brings up the idea of under-sea hydrothermal vents as the nursery of life on earth. These vents are the locations of the outpouring of hot metals and minerals from the mantle to sea floor. A few such structures have been studied in detail and the prodigious amount of energy and complex organic molecules detected around the periphery of these vents makes the idea highly plausible. But readers should keep one thing firmly in their minds. Darwin’s suggestion of the warm pool does not constitute an integral part of the theory of evolution, which is silent on the question of the origin of life. What Darwin proposed was a probable mechanism for the interpolation of his theory to the origins of life itself. Changing the warm pool with the hot vent does not in any way affect the applicability of Darwinian evolution, because once life was afoot (in the figurative way, of course), the further course of action proceeded along the evolutionary pathways. There is no confusion here, but the author could have specifically explained this.The book attempts an overkill on the issue of how eukaryotic cells (having a nucleus inside the cell as opposed to bacteria which don’t possess one) evolved from their more primitive bacterial ancestors. Bacterial body structure is very conservative, we don’t see much change in them even at present since they are supremely adapted to the environment to which they belong. But eukaryotes change rapidly. They were the harbingers of higher life forms. All mammals belong to this family. So, the problem addressed by Lane is the origin of the eukaryotic cell. Evolution by natural selection is the obvious option, but the speed of mutation attested by microbiology is too slow, in fact, so slow that the entire tenure of the earth is not sufficient to cover the development of a nucleus inside the cell. The alternative is a fanciful postulate going by the name of ‘fateful encounter theory’. In a nutshell, when two dissimilar cells come near by chance, one cell gobbles up the other, turning it into its nucleus in the long term. The event is purported to be so fortuitous that it might have occurred only once! Such a remote probability for the origin of all higher forms of life doesn’t augur well for Darwinian evolution. If it had to seek help from a very, very improbable event, how is it going to be functionally different from creation? But on two other occasions, such gobbling up is taken for granted without much nitpicking as in the case of photosynthesizing cells that incorporated cyanobacteria to do their trick with light and ordinary cells accommodating mitochondria for fulfilling their energy demands, even though mitochondria are deemed to be independent bacteria prior to acquiring tenancy inside the cells. Are they too deemed to be fateful encounters? The book doesn’t provide an answer to this vital question.A thought provoking discussion on the meaning of consciousness and its physical significance is provided. Speculations on ending the exclusion of physical forces and particles in describing mind’s action are intriguing. It may be that a new form of quantum interactions not yet identified is behind the working of the mind. This is definitely a bit forcing the issue, as the appeal to undetected quantum fluctuations to explain a point is the hallmark of charlatanism. Another inspiring description is about aging and death. Even though a bit counter intuitive, Lane identifies death as one of the ten inventions made by evolution in its progress at creating complex life forms. If the author is to be believed, a great deal of research is going on to uncover the secrets of aging and death. Early researchers had identified free radicals and antioxidants as the players in this great game, but later research is more ambivalent on the issue. Leak of free radicals from the cells’ mitochondria is the hot cake now, and a gene has been identified among the Japanese which slows down this process. The healthy consequence is longer and healthier lives for those fortunate enough to have this mutation in their genome. However, the effect of this gene is revealed only much later after sexual maturity and hence there is no selective advantage for them. The author expects widespread improvement in man’s healthy lifespan in around two decades as a result of the study going on in the field. A healthy optimism, indeed!As the author is a renowned biochemist, the presentation is geared more towards the mechanism of chemical reactions in focus. Emotions, for him, are not exactly the ineffable experience we feel, but the result of a group of molecules combining with others, in the brain. The relevance of the book is attested to by the up to date information available in it. While most of the books in the genre fall short of the year 1980, Lane has included content right after the year 2000 as well. This is the advantage of being a front runner in the field, which the author is. His infatuation with hydrothermal vents in the early part of the book appears to be verging on the intimidating. The physical layout of the book is not very appealing to the reader, with its very small text that is a burden to read. Also, it assumes a good deal of prior understanding of biological concepts to fully appreciate the content. Statements like ‘a vast number of unicellular protists are facultatively sexual’ (p.132) frankly flew way above my head. The book is gifted with a good index and a nice set of illustrations and photographs. The book is recommended for the serious reader. "
16,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,4,"I don't envy authors who choose to write about biology. Of all the sciences, it lacks the rules and models that make chemistry and physics so enticing. In those subjects, we have the dance of planets generated from the simple inverse square law of gravity, the solved mystery of wave-particle duality, the puzzle pieces of have-electrons need-electrons chemical bonds. But in all those cases, we know what's going on and why--there are rules, there's a reason goddamnit.And then there's biology. Biology, where evolution's blind watchmaker has given us a system that no designer worth their salt would turn in, where available chemicals have multiple functions, where we still can't agree just what a gene is. Biology is short on rules, compared to the other sciences.This makes writing about biology an unenviable task. If you describe what we do know, it's easy to end up reciting lots of seemingly arbitrary facts without the context that helps us assemble them into a consistent narrative. In the early days of natural history, wiry obsessive English gentlemen collected tray after tray of sample: insect, mollusc, leaf, reptile, mammal, nothing was safe. The dry recitation of facts about molecular pathways ends up like these sample collections: lots of detail, but no story about how they all fit together and why.That's why Nick Lane deserves his medals. He's managed to bring this world of proteins, amino acids, DNA, cell innards, and chemical signals to life in a story that somehow stretches from the DNA to sex and hot blooded dinosaurs all the way to consciousness and death. My personal favourite:Shrink yourself down to the size of, say, an ATP molecule, and the cell is a vast cityscape of the future. Stretching as far as you can see in all directions is a giddying array of cables, buttressed with yet more cables. Some look flimsy and thin, while others are of great diameter. In this metropolis of the cell, gravity means nothing, viscosity is everything, and the random jiggling of atoms is all about. Try to move and you will find yourself stuck as if in treacle, yet at once buffeted and jogged from all sides. And suddenly, through this dizzying city comes a peculiar machine, moving at startling speed, hand-over-mechanical-hand, using one of the cables for a track. Attached to this hurtling machine through an unwieldy coupling device is a truly vast object, towed along at speed. If you were in the way, it would be like being hit by a flying power station. Indeed, this is just what it is—it's a mitochondrion, on its way to power the major works over on the other side of the city. And now that you look, various other objects are all heading in the same direction, some faster, some slower, but all towed along the tracks in the sky by similar machines. And whoomp! As the mitochondrion passes, you are caught up in the slipstream, whirled along in the vortex. You are part of the constant circulation that stirs the contents of all complex cells, the cytoplasmic stream.I can't think of the cell in the same way again, and that is surely the mark of great writing. His metaphors are vivid, often unexpected, and perfectly crafted to spotlight the essential elements of the thing being discussed. The only thing I could say is that there are too many: you can dress biology's details in the cloth of metaphor but there are only so many well-dressed details a man can take before his mind leaks. This is definitely a book to read again and again to absorb those stories, but I am not sure that I will.I hesitate because of the other trap that lies in wait for people who write about such an unsettled field as biology: they either describe things we don't have answers for, or they are forced to deal with the explanation that is no explanation—the hypothesis. And that's where Lane's book didn't measure up for me. Lane is a practising biology and isn't shy about taking sides in the debate. On the one hand, taking sides gives us the ""state of play"" of an emerging field and the arguments taking place within it. That's what science is: the cut and thrust of alternative hypotheses which over time are displaced or accepted. But biology is awash in unanswered questions and Lane was forced to deal with multiple open questions in each chapter. Often he was clear about taking sides (""I think this is the kind of theory we should be looking for to explain the origin of life's code""), but the sheer force of his good writing means the reader isn't left thinking ""this is but one of many competing hypotheses"". Lane presents one hypothesis in vivid detail and that's what the reader is left remembering.I was nervous, reading this, that I wasn't building an accurate map of biological reality and history. I was worried that I was instead acquiring a set of stories of possibility, and that I would later be forced to unlearn them. That's fine for scientists, but this layperson struggled to build a conceptual framework for biology and I'm not confident I can change it that easily!Over the course of this review, I've changed my mind. I will reread this book, though I will (gasp!) mark up my copy of the book, in an attempt to clearly mark out the hypotheses from the agreed explanations. I will try to fit into my head more of the wonderfully visual stories of how DNA, cells, and so on work. It is most fitting that this book about the living world is written in living, active, restless prose. It is mostly to delight in this writing that I will reread ""Life Ascending"", to delight and to envy."

It had an interesting premise - The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution - but the author’s handling of the subject matter is almost schoolgirl giddy, a kind of “Oh, look how neat this is! Now look how neat this is! And how about this? Isn’t this neat?” The tone and style of the book put me off and made it tough reading. Others may find it a fine read."
18,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33140147-amy-bowles,5,Wonderful! As a student of biology I followed all the science and was excited to learn new advances since I was in college. I see great things coming along these lines.

20,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10888254-gavin-drury,5,"""I think that the picture painted in this book is true. Life most surely evolved, along the lines described here. That is not dogma, but evidence tested in reality and corrected accordingly. Whether this grand picture is compatible with faith in God, I do not know. For some people, intimately acquainted with evolution, it is; for others, it is not. But whatever our beliefs, this richness of understanding should be a cause for marvel and celebration. It is a most wonderful thing to share so much with the life around us on this blue-green marble, floating through the bleak infinity of space. There is more than grandeur in this view of life. There is fallibility and majesty, and the best human eagerness to know.""If you are interested in evolution, this is a fantastic book, though because it isquite heavy it may be better to start with something like Richard Dawkin's 'Greatest Show On Earth'. Winner of last year's Royal Society prize for Science Writing, it has some of the latest scientific research. This book covers ten particular aspects of life, how exactly they work, how they developed through the process of evolution, and how we know this. The areas he chose to cover fell under the criteria of 'the invention had to revolutionise the living world, and the planet; it had to be of surpassing importance today; it must be a direct outcome of evolution by natural selection; and finally the invention had to be iconic in some way. Some readers may disagree with his ten choices, as the introduction acknowledges, but I went with the flow and it made sense to me.""Starting with the Origin Of Life, it doesn't just trace life back through DNA history to the earliest known forms of bacteria, but goes much deeper into the chemical reactions required to create and maintain these early bacteria and how this could be achieved with what is known about early Earth. It suggests we are not far from finding out exactly how life can emerge from simple proteins. The chapter on Sight, one of the most interesting, shows that the human eye is not as flawed as oft cited and traces back to the origin of sight.Throughout all the different chapters - Sex, Hot Blood, Death, Photosynthesis to name a few - you will learn in depth, the beauty of each of these systems and how and why they evolved, far more than just 'survival of the fittest' and 'selfish genes', but the chemical balances and trade off restrictions involved. One of the most fascinating things I've learned from this book is how and why aging and death evolved, and is not just the natural order of things. The only chapter that deviates from the rest of the book is the chapter on Consciousness as there's no accepted definition of what exactly consciousness is, but it takes a scientific analysis of how it developed and how it may be explained.The book does at points offer up competing theories and admits where scientific knowledge is lacking.Ultimately, reading this gave me a much deeper realisation of the beauty of evolution than I already held. And even if at times some of the chemical processes went beyond my understanding, it's an acceptable level and there's far more information here that's accessible to anyone with an interest in the subject.Score: 6/7"
21,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,5,"""Life Ascending"" by Dr. Nick Lane is a fascinating adventure. I would not recommend it to you as your first book on evolution and probably not as your second or third. However, if you have read enough to somewhat appreciate the role of DNA and genes in evolutionary science, then you will find this book very worth reading. The author is a biochemist and he looks at evolution through a biochemist's eyes. He stops short of introducing structural formulas of organic compounds and focuses more on describing in words, the effects of these chemicals on life processes. In other words, he writes in a popular prose to keep a wider audience interested. Being a chemist myself, but never having taken biochemistry in college, I would have liked to have seen what some of those molecules looked like.Dr. Lane can reach farther back in time than any author who I have ever read. All living things have a common origin if you go back far enough in time. I never imagined that common traits go so far back as this author has identified. Multi-celled life may have evolved less than one billion years ago. Yet, our origins go back much farther than that. The first chapter entitled,""The Origin of Life"" takes you back to the very beginning of life on this planet. He discusses the theories, which have come and gone. He identifies their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, he introduces the theory which he believes is most likely to be true. He delivers a convincing argument for it. The remaining chapters examine: DNA, Photosynthesis, The Complex Cell, Sex, Movement, Sight, Hot Blood, Consciousness, and Death. Each chapter examines the history of research on these topics, evaluates the prevailing theories and finally presents the reader with his favorite and sometimes personal explanation for how evolution worked its magic.I enjoyed this book immensely! I had previously done a lot of reading on evolutionary topics and wondered if I would be rehashing the same old concepts. I didn't need to worry about that with Dr. Lane. He took me to places I had never been before and made the trip very stimulating.Ralph D. Hermansen, September 30, 2010 "
22,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4894615-mark,5,"Life Ascending, winner of the 2010 Royal Society prize for popular science books, is one of the greatest of all time. The OEDB list of greatest popular science books is out of date. This is science on the cutting edge, championing theories that have been gaining attention slowly in recent years, among those interested in biology but not in the mass media. Techniques, equipment and insights started with the Human Genome Project, plus the ability to see and model ever tinier structures, have led to big advances the understanding of DNA, RNA, and their relationship with biochemistry.Written in ten chapters of distinct subjects, it is an easier read than his near textbook level ""Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life"". Anybody with any knowledge and interest in science can grasp the metaphors and other techniques he uses to convey the concepts underlying these theories if they are willing to take the time to understand each paragraph before moving on.If you'd like a summary of the book, Lane wrote an article in which he condenses the basic idea of each chapter into a medium length paragraph. A page that was still active at the time of this review is here:http://integral-options.blogspot.com/...If that doesn't work when you go looking, do a search on ""10 things I'd tell Darwin"" and ""Nick Lane"".I do have to say that he'd have taken less flack for his discussion of consciousness if he'd made it the last part of a chapter on what are the current theories on the origin and history of the nervous system.

23,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8512466-maurice,4,"And how did consiousness rise from lifeless matter? His chapter about consciousness has some interesting things to say about that. With that I mean that is has become possible to observe the brain working, seeing specialised regions at work in the brain.They see how the brain - while the person looks at an object- has 30 to 60 regions of specialised neurons firing. They only fire when their litle aspect is recognised.E.g. we have neurons specialised in firing only when an object moves from left to right.From this 'diverse collectoin of single observations' the brain then constructs - decides?- what it is that it sees, after passing it through a filter of experience and expectations. Fascinating.I found the statement at the end of this chapter to be the work of censorhip. There he says that well you cant make the jump from matter to consiousness and best leave it there. Its wording, melody, its communication pattern, is out of phase with the main body of work.We share consiousness with other social mammals like primates and dolphins. It may be nothing more than a specialised brain region similar in the prefrontal cortex.What makes this best selling book so good is the level of detail on the chemicals of life and how they work. Photosynthesis e.g. is explained from the molecules upward. He closes the gap between geology and first chemical biology! This level of detail will make it a boring book for most people though. But the smooth and well written text makes it easy for anyone with an interest in this matter to pick up the book and read it."

Lane approaches scientific controversy with a light hand, but he talks about the real issues and the real science going on. Lane is a practicing biochemist who writes popular science, and it shows. This book is framed around 10 ""innovations"" evolved by life: all the way from the origin of life to mitochondria to consciousness and death. A lot of the general issues I've become familiar with from the scientific literature (Lane himself writes on these topics for Nature and refers to those articles throughout the book), but this book is at the Goldilocks level of enough but not too much detail. Sometimes I feel like the book gets a little too scientific for a general audience, and once in a while I wonder if the study Lane is highlighting is really ""all that""; for example, I'd like to see the findings replicated that he reports as a tiny change in mitochondria causing a huge change in human lifespan, but it appears to rest on one paper from Japan. I do give Lane props for addressing consciousness with fairness, arguing for his interpretation rather than disparaging the Pope as he quotes him, little things like that. As interesting as the content of this book is, it's the tone that really impresses me and is something I'd like to emulate from my viewpoint. "

DeathIn each section Lane discusses what we know about the topic, then moves into more speculative and cutting edge research. He does a good job explaining the basics, but does not provide enough information to carry the reader through the end of each chapter.

Most of the middle parts are weaker, those treating sex, movement, and hot blood.The final two chapters, on consciousness and death, are hardly worth reading. They veer off into thinly supported territory and speculation, and should be buried under a pound of salt. For instance, near the close of the chapter on death he says:Let me put that more strongly.

I listed to this on auido and it kind of felt like a podcast in the manner it was presented. It was really fun and I liked the reader a lot. This is a great one to throw on your audiobook list if you love science, and I am sure the hard copy would be equally as good. It's just a very different approach to a subject that already gets a lot of attention. "
28,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170150-sheng-peng,2,"For all the topics that are covered in his magnum opus Power Sex Suicide, the author is eloquent as usual. But on other matters on which he is obviously not a true expert, the writing is no different than random musings from a layman. The chapter on Consciousness is so bad that it is verging on philosophical contemplations with the signature incomprehensibleness of writings from that field, and reminds one of hot air from the typical TV talk head babbling on a random subject. To have written this book after the magnificent Power book aforementioned is just shameful."
29,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32046266-adam,1,"I saw so many positive reviews for this I thought I'd write something quick and offensive.If you ""love science"", by which you mean you're subscribed to MinutePhysics and DNews on YouTube, seen some TV documentaries and ""love Sheldon"" from The Big Bang Theory, then you'll love this book.On the other hand, if you were educated in biology beyond the age of six, have an IQ above 7 and prefer accuracy over 'colourful' (euphemism for inaccurate) descriptions, then this isn't for you.I can't be bothered to insult my eyes and mind further by opening it up to cite some examples.Enjoy!"
30,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15132581-easha,2,"I had high hopes for this book, because I thought it had an interesting, well thought-out structure and because of its high rating on Goodreads. My main problem with the book was the author's writing style, which came across as arrogant and overly digressive. Unfortunately, this became such a problem for me that I didn't get past the first two chapters.Maybe I will give this book another go in the future; some of the reviews have given me renewed hope that it gets better!"

32,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58851414-markusq,2,"I simultaneously want to give this book five stars for concept and general approach and negative one star for hideously sloppy execution. I would have abandoned it half way through (about the point where he managed to conflate hot tempers with exothermic metabolisms under the phrase ""hot blooded"" for rhetorical purposes, tripped on his shoe laces and then stumbled through a whole chapter without getting things straight) but I'm as subject to the train-wreck effect as anyone, and just couldn't look away.For example, on page 208 I read ""Dress up a lizard in a fur coat (needless to say, earnest researchers have done exactly this) and the lizard gets steadily colder"" and I was gripped by the notion of solving the world's energy needs with Lizard-powered perpetual motion machines. Who'd have guessed that the second law applies to everything in the universe except lizards. On page 79, the phrase ""intimate but opposite partners, like man and women, reunited after diverging from an egg"" gave me the giggles, thinking how the birds & bees talk must go in his family.Most of the bloopers are more structural though. A true follower of the Bad Analogy Guy, he gets excited about about the parallel he's drawing (or worse, the pun he thinks he can slip in) and loses track of the point he's trying to make. For example, on page 130 we find ""[S]ex has the power to amass a large number of mutations in each of two healthy parents and focus them all into a single child. This is the New Testament method. Just as Christ died for collected sins of humanity, so too can sex bring together the accumulated mutations of a population into a single scapegoat, and then crucify it."" This convoluted reasoning goes to great effort to miss the point; it does no good at all to put all the bad mutations into a single child--the benefit is that sex can produce some children with fewer bad mutations.Others have mentioned his obsession with comparing sex and chemistry (thus enzymes are like beer, nudge-nudge jokes about exothermic reactions, and so on), his confusion about the level of selection (he repeatedly goes for the group selection explanation first, while using the terminology of ""selfish genes"" and getting himself confused), the persistent (but unstated) assumption that religion comes in two flavours (Catholic and not-Catholic) and so forth. So I'll stop enumerating.The ideas in this book are fascinating. And the writing is technically quite good. Unfortunately, they are at best loosely coupled, and the reader frequently has to slog through drifts of clever prose that hide tangled mats of sloppy reasoning to connect them. I suspect that many people don't bother, and just slide across the surface enjoying the witty innuendo and pretending they are learning about science. "
33,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924813-dan,5,"A very enjoyable book for one interested in evolutionary biology. I suspect anyone without a recent advanced degree in the field will find much of interest. While there are several kinds of minor annoyances, the book is an easy five stars. It needed one more editor: a hard-headed writing editor, not science editor (so far as this layman with science background can see). The book won the 2010 Royal Society Science Book Prize for popular science writing.Some criticisms are mystifying. I don't recall exaggeration. Of course there is speculation. It is better called ""hypothesis"", a mainspring of science. The writer takes care to distinguish hypothesis from fact. Historical science is tricky because it is hard to experiment on history. That scientists have discovered so much of evolutionary history set forth in this book is astounding. There is yet much to learn, and we won't get anywhere without hypotheses.Perhaps one who dismissed the thermal vent origin of life when the book was published will reconsider, as it is now (2018) generally accepted as the best explanation.Paleontologists may be said to ""bicker"" about whether dinosaurs are hot-blooded or cold-blooded, but science proceeds by debate until sufficient facts are discovered to decide an issue. Dinosaurs did dominate the earth for over 125 million years. Their most recent fossils are 66 million years old. It is fortunate that there is enough evidence to start a debate, and evidence there is on either side.The author rejects dualism and explains his choice of terminology in footnote 2 of Chapter 9. Perhaps some readers have a different edition from mine: Norton, 2010.The authors addresses and rejects on evidence the telomere shortening theory on lifespan (across species) in footnote 9 of Chapter 10.The author hardly compares classical music with muscle proteins. He contemplates evolutionary variations on a theme.Anyone wanting a complete understanding of any of the material would be well advised to find a huge biology book or a series of them.The last two chapters are necessarily more speculative and not offered as dogma but rather as educated conjecture leavened with available facts.Please don't try to digest this book in two days without a recent advanced degree in biology. I benefitted by re-studying the first chapters."
34,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,"I think the best way for me to review this book is to summarize what I learned from each chapter.Obviously many of these things are well known to experts but they were new to me.Chapter 1 (Origin of Life)-The primordial soup theory (Miller experiment) is probably wrong because we don't think the early earth had the right mix of chemicals and it seems thermodynamically unlikely.Chapter 2 (DNA)-The genetic code has ""fourfold degeneracy"" (The last letter seems to be unnecessary in many cases).Chapter 3 (Photosynthesis)-Photosynthesis uses a ""Z scheme"" (which should really be called an ""N"" scheme) which requires 2 different photons to energize an electron at different stages.Chapter 4 (Complex Cell)-Complex (eukaryotic) cells are 10,000 to 100,000 times the volume of (simple) prokaryotic cells like bacteria.Chapter 5 (Sex)-The advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction is that it allows organism to keep the good mutations without getting bogged down by the junk mutations. With asexual reproduction a few bad mutations can take the good ones down with them. (""Selective Interference theory"")Chapter 6 (Motility)-Myosin in muscles acts a bit like a rower pulling a boat, or someone climbing a ladder.Chapter 7 (Eyes)-Some deep sea creatures that have ""eyes"" on their backs!-There is a systematic trade-off observed between resolution and light sensitivity in the ""eyes"" of different species.Chapter 8 (Hot Blood)-The low oxygen atmosphere after the Permian Extinction may have been one of the reasons for the evolution of warm bloodednessChapter 9 (Consciousness)-There are actually a lot of ""respectable"" scientists who think that consciousness can only be explained with ""additional properties of matter"" (such as quantum properties).Chapter 10 (Death)-There is some solid evidence that free radicals are the cause of cellular damage and aging.I like how he tells the story in an engaging way and he gives just enough detail without losing the big picture.In general I think this is a really good tour through some of the biggest open questions in biology and it does a great job describing the various competing theories where there is no agreed upon consensus."
35,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18808584-jonny-thomson,4,"I've moaned in the past about books that, in the attempt to make science accessible, have over worked their brief and ended up with overly simplified, even patronising, books. Well, this book is the book I was due and deserved because, bugger me, it's deep end. ...this really did put my GCSE biology to the test....but I really enjoyed it! I'm almost entirely certain that I will only retain and reuse about 5 or 10% of the things that I learned, but even that would make it worth the read - everything is so fascinating. I found it brilliant diving into some of the more modern debates surrounding evolution (I really liked the last chapter on what aging really is, for example), and really enjoyed the chronological progression. My favourite sections were on DNA, photosynthesis and the hot vs. cold blooded chapters - they, for me, struck the perfect balance of education and entertainment without being in anyway dumbed down (obviously it is more dumbed down that a research paper!).There are two reasons why it lost a star for me:1) As with any of these ""top ten"" or any list-based book, the chances are that some are just not going to be your cup of tea. This will likely be different from person to person. For me, the chapters on muscles, consciousness (my background in philosophy made this all a bit old-hat), and cells were duller. 2) Whilst I appreciate the tone of this book, there are times when it does err slightly into being a bit esoteric to the point of being impregnable. Again, this will depend on the reader's base biological knowledge, but for me some sections bamboozled- for example, the chapter on cells exploring how eukaryotic cells evolved from the chimeral blending of archia and proto-bacteria. This is all interesting no doubt, and I'm glad I persevered, but by god it took some chewing to digest.A really well written and pitched book that I respect for its refusal to patronise and dumb down."
36,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8288733-sundar,4,"It's a great book to learn from and wonder about some of the significant and seemingly almost impossible milestones in the course of evolution of life. For such things as evolution of life from non-life, death, sex, consciousness etc., the book doesn't cause any major dissonance. It presents a bold and convincing thesis for each of the ten items, while being open about gaps which need to be filled. It's also refreshingly different from some other books on evolution which focus excessively on countering dogmas opposed to principles of natural selection. There are only two issues I had with this book. Firstly, it's written with a heavy biochemist's perspective (which the author is) often relegating the beautiful morphological and ecological details to footnotes. Secondly, the language could use some more literary devices and figures of speech given the genre and the subject itself. Though the author did make some good puns and brilliant prose in some of the chapters like the one of the evolution of consciousness. "
37,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22552381-chirag,4,"Evolution is a fascinating phenomenon. The complex living organisms we see today have all evolved from bacteria which emerged 4 billion years ago on mother earth. Nick has chosen an interesting way to convey the concept. He chose 10 inventions of evolution and described what they are and how they came to be. Each invention is fascinating and well described. We also realize that there is a still a lot we don't know. I specially liked the last invention, ""Death"" and how longer lifespan, if not eternal, is possible.The writing is a little complex than other books I have read, but it may be a good thing for someone else. Being a science book, it is filled with lot of technical details and requires reader's full attention to fully grasp the content. Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning how we evolved."
38,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,5,"The first chapter was almost too dense, but it got a bit more accessible as it went on. Nick Lane is the sort of author who's too sciency and technical for most casual readers, but not technical enough for pros. You really have to be VERY interested in the subject matter, and willing to reread sections if you haven't spent years in school for this to really absorb a lot of what he has to say- but it IS worth knowing, as dense as it seems sometimes. I for one feel like I learned a ton- and learning is work. Reading Nick Lane's books is (sometimes hard!) WORK, but it's good work, and it's worth it- my brain is happier, and my perspective on life and the universe are more thoughtful because of having read these. I only wish I had more of them."
39,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40745083-amir-khan,5,This book was amazing! The author provided a nuanced and detailed insight into very complex and interesting biological processes while making it incredibly digestible to the reader. While sometimes the chapters got quite long and dense the author never failed to provide useful analogies for difficult concepts.Not only was this book interesting but it was heavily thought provoking often leaving me with interesting moral and with ethical questions to ponder. In places it felt less like a science book and more like a philosophy text with a biological background.A must read for anyone even slightly interested in the history of living things! As well as for those interested in some thought provoking insights into the possible future of evolution and humankind.
40,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,5,"After wasting my time on a couple of unsatisfactory ""popular science"" books (on trees and octopuses), it was a joy to read this - a book with real intellectual heft. Lane's breadth and depth of knowledge are immense. And he is unafraid to give opinions. The choice of topics here is fascinating, including such unusual ones as the evolution of hot blood and movement. It feels like archaeology as he peels away layer upon layer of possible explanation, getting to ever deeper theories. I can't say that I understood all of it (biochemistry is a tough ask for popular science, especially for chemistry numbskulls like me), but there's no doubt that this is the level at which evolution should be explained: it opens up vistas that render facile physiological or anatomical accounts. Brilliant."
41,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8952979-richard,4,"An unexpectedly long-ish, quirky, reservedly funny book about cool aspects of life - how, for example, photosynthesis came to be, as well as sex, movement, eyes, and consciousness itself. I loved the author’s extended treatment of eukaryotic cell evolution, and about the different kinds of hydrothermal vents, and how one kind not only furnishes many basic building blocks of life, but also leaves traces of its influence on the fundamental biochemical processes of life, in organisms that haven’t had anything directly to do with a vent in billions of years.It all sounds arcane or geeky maybe, but it’s written in a way that I felt made the core ideas accessible to non-specialists.I’m thinking of reading parts of this book again."
42,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96281400-elona,3,"An interesting book with a greater focus on the cellular details of evolution and life than I expected. Unfortunately, I found a lot of the specific details to have explanations that either go over my head or just not be explained well enough. I found the level of prior knowledge the author expected to be inconsistent; sometimes very basic things were explained thoroughly (which I don't mind in a popular science book) and some areas that I did not have a prior understand of were never given an explanation. Despite these problems, I expect that a lot of the ideas presented in the book will stick with me and influence my thinking about life and its evolution."
43,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31524695-bart-stuck,5,"The author is a biochemist, and I find it fascinating how his training and weltanschaung shapes many very logical yet initially very counterintuitive aspects of evolution and life as we know it. I would recommend this thought provoking book to anyone who wants to get an overview of modern biochemistry (crystallography, genetics and genomic sequencing, ATP and on and on and on) and is willing to suspend disbelief while data is gathered, hypotheses are formed, analysis occurs and this leads to some surprising logical compelling conclusions!"
44,0393065960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73384419-tavo,5,"I'm no huge fan of biochemistry, specially of its history, but this book was surprisingly very enjoyable and hard to put down. The way the story is narrated makes it obvious that the author loves the topic. My only critique is that I expected a more biological explanation or a detailed comparison in the consciousness chapter. However, the author did his homework and was very well acquainted with the topic. I would read about any other topic if it were narrated with his style, it is simply easy to follow and very enjoyable."

I love reading and studying about evolution in almost every aspect, but I don't love having to read almost 300 pages of a grown man's temper tantrum. Nick Lane does an injustice to the scientific and anthropological communities by waiving basic ethics and sound argument and leaning so heavily upon his biases that I cannot, in good faith, call this a book of science."
