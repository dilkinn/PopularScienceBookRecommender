0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3089655-bookaddict-la-crimson-femme,2,"This is more a 2.5 star which as people who follow me know, I truncate, not round up. This book started out very riveting. The theory proposed in this book is about the impacts based on the lack of empathy. There were two interesting concepts of Zero Negative and Zero Positive people. Basically Borderline, Psychopaths and Narcissists all fall under the Zero Negative. Different forms of autism falls under the Zero Positive. The ideas in this book are interesting to read. What Mr. Baron-Cohen postulates did make me think. I can see his point regarding the how a person with zero negative and zero positive would behave. His research and theories on why these people became w/o empathy dropped me from a 4 star down to a 3 star. Yes, at the beginning, the first two chapters were very good and had me at a 4 star. At chapter 3 I started to lose interest. This is because he correlates a person with zero negative stemming from how their mother raised them. In each example, it was abuse, neglect, etc from a mother. Where is the father in all of this? Were these children through immaculate conception? This immediately made Mr. Baron-Cohen lose respectability in my eyes. To his point, he does point out it is genetics and a combination of nurture which causes a person to be a zero negative. The examples he chose left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not even a mother. This ""mommy didn't love me enough"" or ""daddy abandoned me"" type of victimized mentality doesn't work for me. Whenever I read this, I consider the writer yet another 1st world privileged philosopher who is only looking at ""1st world"" problems. Is this judgmental? You betcha. I'm tired of people using their parents as excuses for their behaviour. The victim mentality is detrimental because it focuses on how the person is helpless. I'd rather focus on the series of events which shaped a person and for them to be a survivor. Now, Mr. Baron-Cohen did indicate while an abusive or neglectful mother isn't the only variable causing a child to become a psychopath, there was a positive correlation. He does also mention that the tie can't be that strong because otherwise, we'd have more psychopaths running around in the world. However, the book is already tainted for me because his victim theory.Now, there are some concepts in here that are interesting. He explains that it's not that people are evil. It's because their lack of empathy which causes them to behave in manners that don't make sense to the general populace. If people w/o empathy treat the another person as a thing, one can understand how atrocities such as Jew concentration camps and the genocide of Armenians can occur. With this, I agree. That is why the military teaches it's soldiers to call them ""targets"". It removes the humanity of it. Still, this book is running at a 3 star, especially the section on the zero positive. I couldn't stop thinking of the Observers from Fringe when he describes the pattern recognition in the zero positives. The highly functioning abilities of systematizing is fascinating. What was disturbing is seeing how I possibly could have been categorized as a zero positive in my early teens. Chapter 6 is what brought the book down another 1/2 star. While it is nice to think every person can be ""rehabilitated"" with the single flower nurtured in the desert analogy, it's a fantasy. Here's the problem, in order for rehabilitation, the person must want to rehabilitate. I don't believe people want to change. In fact, I'd like to propose that more than the majority of people prefer not to change. I see it time and time again in both personal and professional life. People don't like to know their flaws and they don't want to improve. They'd rather hide their flaws from themselves and rationalize it is other people. So his idea to help people overcome their ""lack of empathy"" while noble is a pipe dream in my book. If he had specific methods of how to accomplish this, it would be a different story. Instead, he concludes the book with condemning the death penalty and explaining that ""evil"" actions of people are not exactly under their control. Instead, it is a combination of chemical, genetic and nurture. We should instead try to help rehabilitate all these people rather than sentence them in jail for years or kill them. These are the fancies of an ivory tower academician untouched by the stubborn people of the real world."

It was the vision of the ultimate evil mischief-maker that Borat was. Borat in a fluorescent green mankini was behind every word I read. Once seen, never forgotten...  So one of them makes a living out of analysing people and philosophising on whether cruelty and evil is genetic and the other makes his living out of exploiting people with deliberate cruelty that I'm sure his victims think is evil.I know which I prefer. Schadenfreude is a very evil sense of humour. Laughing at other people's misfortune is cruel. I wonder if it was inborn in me or I acquired it?The book was ok, not exhaustive and I didn't agree with the author's conclusions quite often. 3.5 stars."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3226609-the-angry-lawn-gnome,0,"I can't really review this book, for the simple reason that I do not trust it, and am simply unsure what to believe and what not to. Perhaps my attitude is unfair, but it was these two passages that pushed me into Sgt. Schultz mode:Some people compare him to the character that Dustin Hoffman played in the film Rain Man, which was based on a real person (Kim Peek) with autism, because... (p. 106, my edition)Consider that back in 1542 Martin Luther wrote a pamphlet entitled Against the Jews (calling on Catholics to attack them) in which he advocated burning synagogues and destroying Jewish homes. (p. 166, my edition)Kim Peek did not have autism. One need dig no deeper than his NY Times obituary (link) to ferret that fact out. I'd put this down as an honest mistake for most, but Baron-Cohen is supposed to be a world renowned expert on the topic of...autism. Sorry, dude, but you flat-out blew it.Martin Luther's tedious imbecility on the topic of Jews is certainly true, but how Baron-Cohen got the idea he was trying to incite Catholics against them is not only wrong, it is utterly preposterous. In fact, Luther even took a swipe at Catholics...in the very document Baron-Cohen claims was used ""incite"" them. Viz:Similarly among us Christians the papists can no longer pass for the church. For they will not let God be their God, because they refuse to listen to his word, but rather persecute it most terribly, then come along with their empty husks, chaff, and refuse, as they hold mass and practice their ceremonies. And God is supposed to recognize them and look upon them as his true church, ignoring the fact that they do not acknowledge him as the true God, that is, they do not want him to speak to them through his preachers. His word must be accounted heresy, the devil, and every evil. This he will indeed do, as they surely will experience, far worse than did the Jews.Link to document - The switch from Jews to Catholics occurs at the end of Part II, though it is back to the Jews in Part III.'Course Luther had a reason to be sore with Catholicism, since he'd been excommunicated and had a Church sanctioned document issued against him personally, wherein he could be killed on sight with neither civil nor religious penalties accruing against his murderer. (A Catholic version of a fatwa? Maybe. But it also seems to be the case that no one ever bothered trying, as best I can tell.) In fact, I'd say you could make a case Luther was saying Catholics, or possibly just the Church hierarchy, was in deeper doo-doo than Jews with God, based upon that last sentence.Perhaps the two errors cited above are the only two in the book, and perhaps everything else is scholarship so pure it hurts the eyes to glance upon. But I doubt it. In my eyes the entire book took on the mantle of sloppy scholarship after hitting those two easily checked, inexcusable errors. I make no claims at genius or expertise -- quite the contrary! -- so if I'm picking up on wince-worthy passages, how many more might there be in here? Certainly in the Martin Luther bit he cites a source that he himself never bothered reading. (Would he tolerate such a thing from one of his students?) Anyway, I'm giving the work no rating, since I cannot confidently say that there are sections of this work with which I have little familiarity (and that would be most of it) containing errors similar to the ones I've noted. His level of credibility with me has essentially fallen off a cliff; I'm not certain I'd accept anything he's written without independent verification. Very sad, since I'd previously held him in high regard."

This is one of those books. Be warned, 'The Science of Evil' will make you disgusted and enlightened at the same time. What dug into my heart even more were the real life photos of acts of terror. It's gut-wrenching to see what people are capable of. It's unspeakable. First Chapter: ★ Nazi scientists severed a woman's hands and then sewed them back Switched. So her thumbs on the outside of her hands.Holy F#%K!!!  ★ Some Nazi held experiments to see if people could survive being submerged in freezing water up to 3 hours. Double F#%K!! ★ Rebel soldiers ordering women to bash their children's heads into poles until they died to survive another day. Jesus, F#%king F#%K!!!!! ★ Nazis were not to first to kill thousands of people. The Turks killed over 1.5 million Armenians in 1890. They weren't even allowed to testify in court as witnesses, let alone pled their case. Did i say Fff#%kk!?!?!!! ★ In 1994, in Democratic Republic of Congo rebels attacked a village and forced a woman's son to have sex with her while they watched and then they shot him in front of her. Then each one of the soldiers raped the woman while her husband was forced to watch and then he was shot as well in front of the woman. Last but not least, they left her staring at her burning house and took her 3 daughters away from her. She hasn't heard from her daughters since. I cant even.... F... :oThe scariest part, these cruel people who did these operations were doctors. People we are brought up to trust, performing unethical experiments on innocent lives.And soldiers that are there to protect. I found it interesting how the author examined further into what makes people ""evil"". Evil is a broad definition that is used to describe many different people. He substituted evil with the word empathy or lack of empathy. Suddenly, character traits were more easily defined and their actions were explained. Some had lack of empathy because of their desire to protect and were blinded, others because of revenge or hate and in some instances, pure hunger. The things you will do when you've been starved for days, and pure instinct takes over are unfathomable. Emotions are dissected....“When our empathy is switched off, we are solely in the ""I"" mode. In such a state we relate only to things or to people as if they were just things.”Each chapter gave me goosebumps. I learned things that shocked me to the core! I had so many chills that i had to take breaks just to collect myself. Im grateful to learn about the human mind and how we as a society have evolved but some of these atrocities just made me sick. It was like reading horror story after horror story.  ★ Fun Fact: Marilyn Monroe's real name was Norma Jean Mortenson. Norma?! Really? ...huh. I guess I'm the only one who's a huge fan of Psycho. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ★ I never knew that Marilyn Monroe was a child of divorced parents and a mother who was in the psychiatric ward most of her life. She went from foster care to foster care. When she was 11 and she was sexually molested by her stepfather! What?! She first got married when she was 16 to her neighbor to get out of foster care. She remarried 2 more times to all failed marriages. She was in and out of psychiatric clinics like her mother and attempted suicide three times! She succeeded killing herself, overdosing in 1962. Whoa...I think my biggest take away after reading this book is how empathy is related to the brain. I never knew that certain parts of our brain control our lack or over abundance of the trait with hormones and proteins. It is really interesting. (-1★) I took away a star for the sole reason of some of the tests mentioned. 'Bla bla bla, this test shows this information according to this doctor and this many patients, bla bla bla, but it is not conclusive; or it was not proven; or the patients life history was never taken into account or recorded....etc.' ☠ -Wait, WHAT? Why would you mention test results if they are not 99% true or even taken correctly?! I felt like my time was wasted reading those sentences over and over again. When i read a science or psychology book i want concrete hard proof of the evidence your basing your topic on. Not hearsay. Its like saying ""1+1=11, because Eddie from the store told me, but it needs more working out."" Ugh!!!! ☠I liked the statement: ""Narcissists have monologues, not dialogues.""During the Nazi reign, people who helped gather up the jews did not consider themselves part of the killing, instead they justified their actions by making statements like this... ➤ Person A: ""I simply had the list of Jews in my municipality. I did not round up the Jews, but I did pass this list on when requested to do so."" ➤ Person B: ""I was told to go to these addresses, arrest these people, and take them to the train station. That's all I did.""  ➤ Person C: ""My job was to open the doors of the train—that was it."" ➤ Person D: ""My job was to direct the prisoners onto the train.""  ➤ Person E: ""My job was to close the doors, not to ask where the train was going or why.” ➤ Person F: ""My job was simply to drive the train.""  [through all the other small links in the chain that could lead to . . .] ➤ Person Z: ""My job was simply to turn on the showers out of which the poison gas was emitted.”All in all, there is a lot of important information in this book about the brain, people's personalities and upbringings. T discusses the how they impact one another and how to judge each one. This book made me dissect the word 'evil' as a word used to describe someone and dive further into what made them do the act. I enjoyed the book and appreciated the message. I agree that empathy or lack of empathy should hold a bigger part in psychology than it does. :)"
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1362376-avolyn-fisher,2,"I find that this book could be a lot shorter than it is, for the fact that it is repetitive and offers a lot of hypothesis and questions rather than answers or true discoveries. It regurgitates what has already been mentioned about narcissism, autism, antisocial disorder, and borderline disorder. I am not an expert on psychological studies but it appeared to only state what has already been stated and suggest that there are links between those disorders and levels of empathy in certain individuals and how that could potentially cause them to be inclined towards evil ways. Not that I think this is a bad link to be studying, but it basically stated that they are not sure if there is a link between the two and was so vague that I felt that this book accomplished nearly nothing. You are left with just as many questions if not more than when you went in and while it may be good in some cases to write something that causes society to question something that is being under-questioned, I read the book to get answers and data on proof or near-proof to actual conclusions.However the book was very interesting for about 5 pages when it discussed the discoveries about empathy that were observed in animals such as mice and monkeys. I felt that a more interesting question isn't how Hitler or certain people in history could be so evil but rather, how they were able to get so many 'normal' or 'common' people to commit such horrendous acts when they were seemingly healthy psychologically. The fact that Hitler may have been messed up psychologically and that that could have contributed to his demise is not ground breaking, earth shattering information that I couldn't have gathered on my own. It was interesting but I don't know that I would recommend it because I feel reading it came quite close to a waste of my time. Especially when you consider how many other books are out there to read and all the books you could be reading instead of this one."

6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"I met Simon Baron Cohen in 2004 as part of my exploration of the role of empathy (and lack of it or autism) in my field of conflict research. He is an extraordinary person to discuss these issues, with and his knowledge and compassion for the children he treats for development disorders strongly evident. His book 'The Essential Difference' played a major role in the evolution of my theory of 'induced autism' in conflict. His latest book extends his thinking into the role of zero degrees of empathy in the commission of acts of extreme evil. Since I met him, neuroscience has moved on rapidly and his latest book brings up to date the 10 areas of the brain that seem most implicated in empathy, or its lack, and also the half a dozen or so genes whose expression also contributes a genetic dimension to empathy or its absence. Identical twin research suggests that empathy has about 60% heritability, but the sample size and peer review process is probably not complete for that to be taken as proven.I literally read this book in one sitting (despite the trans-Atlantic jet lag) and would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the problem of evil from a scientific viewpoint, and especially if you are interested in reducing it! Though the author warns at the onset: don't read this book if you are sensitive to descriptions of appalling evil, as that is how he starts out defining what he is trying to understand, though there is far more to the book than this. He systematically un-picks the different empathy deficiencies of borderline personality, psychopath and narcissistic disorders and how they have at their extreme zero degrees of empathy. His accounts of the genetic and developmental causes of these disorders is strongly evidence based, though in the case of extreme narcissism the research is so far limited.He also builds on his work in The Essential Difference on the systematizer/empathizer contrast and provides a convincing case that many of those with zero empathy are not borderline, psychopath or narcissistic but in fact use their strong systematizing to build very rigid moral structures. Extreme systematizers also have given us most of our science and technology.The only weak part of the book is that Simon stops too soon and his phenomenal ability to develop ways to address issues of autism is not fully deployed. He ends with ten steps to increase empathy in the world and even grow in those with zero degrees. I would have loved another full chapter on where now."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,4,"Can evil be quantified? If you had to study 'evil' from a scientific perspective, with all the bells and whistles available within a laboratory, how would you go about it? This is the question that has fascinated me for a long time and if it fascinates you then this is a book you should peruse. Cohen begins with the fascinating idea of redefining evil as an absence of empathy. This tiny little change opens the door for a scientifically valid method of quantifying evil from a psychological perspective. If empathy is the ability to identify with someone else's thinking and responding in an acceptable manner then a complete absence of such an intuition opens the door for categorizing different personality types typically accused of being evil. The book initially elaborates on borderline personality disorder, psychopathy and narcissistic personality disorder. The author goes into detail with regards to the parts of the brain contributing to the sense of empathy (cumulatively the 'empathy circuit') and explains well how these areas fire abnormally in the brains of people with such psychological issues. The definition of empathy that the author proposes also opens up a window into understanding autism spectrum disorders from a fresh perspective. If psychopaths are people who do not feel any empathy (no affective empathy) but can recognize the feeling from the expressions/body language in others (cognitive empathy), what if people in the autistic spectrum are the exact opposite? According to this thesis, if the empathy circuit in the brain is wired such that a person can feel empathy (affective empathy) but cannot understand that others are capable of the same (cognitive empathy) then psychologists commonly diagnose such individuals under the umbrella term of autism-spectrum. Cohen gives a lot of experimental findings that seem to support this idea and to me it was a fascinating experience to gain a new perspective into autism and asperger syndrome. Here I also learned about 'alexithymia' - the inability of understanding emotion (of others and one's own), literally meaning 'without words for emotion' and this is something individuals with autism invariably experience (hence supporting the cognitive empathy prognosis in the previous sentence).Cohen's appeal that psychologists and psychiatrists should pay more attention to empathy and the empathy centers of their patients before treating them sounded like good advice by the end of the book. The main idea that this book propounds and one which I found fascinating even if it requires further experimental evidence to be accepted fully is that when acts of cruelty occur, they are invariably the result of a malfunctioning empathy circuit. Various factors could influence this malfunction such as genetics, cultural sanctions, personal ideology, obedience etc. This puts goosebumps-inducing force into the words of Historian Ian Kershaw - 
""The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference""
The reason why I enjoyed reading this book was summed up eloquently by the author himself - 
""If I have an agenda, it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the concept of ""evil"" as an explanatory tool, and if I have successfully moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.""
I enjoy books that talk about new ideas that I wasn't previously familiar with and that probably added to my enjoyment. If you are someone well-versed/well-read in cognitive psychology and behavioral sciences then there may not be much that is new here for you. For others, this may be a fun book to read."

This book teaches the readers to be afraid of people who suffer really awful things already!!Not only are the facts in this book wrong (bpd patients not having empathy? Are you kidding me right now???), they are incredibly intolerant and hurtful. The last thing the mentally ill need are outsiders telling them they're awful, unethical, evil people the way this book argues. If you value the respect of anyone with a mental illness, please do not touch this book."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This is a disappointing book. The author overstates the case for empathy. ""Empathy itself is the most valuable resource in the world,"" he writes. Since uncaring leads to cruelty and inappropriate social responses, he argues that we need more empathy. If it were as simple as asserting that it be so. The author defines empathy as only a good thing as far as social relationships are concerned, but some have argued that it is this capacity to identify with what goes on in others that gives sadists pleasure or possibly underlies homophobia. Still, we know that the author doesn't mean that kind of empathy. He says the good kind of empathy varies across a range (the empathy bell curve) from zero to much, and argues that both environmental and genetic factors interact in ways that determine where one falls within that range. That suggests we can work on enhancing empathy (teaching, good habits, etc.), but it also suggests that a good part of human kind is inherently predisposed to anti-social behavior.Then there are the empirical measures the author uses for empathy. Empirical suggests scientific, but the measures seem subjective and likely miss the essence of what he's after. Among his top ten measures, he asks whether one enjoys caring for others, whether it's hard to know what to do in a social situation, and whether it bothers one to be late meeting a friend. It's common enough to not really ""enjoy caring"" for others, but that's not the same as wishing them ill and acting to harm. It could be the awkwardness of a social situation is due to boredom or frustration with superficiality. As for lateness, does this mean a good part of the non western world is not empathetic? If these questions seem nit picky, look at these measures from another perspective: Are some ""non-empathetic"" sociopaths good at manipulation because they are acutely aware of how others will react to what they do?Something more fundamental is missing from this discussion of ""the science of evil."" The widespread cruelty throughout history by leaders and collective groupings of people points in the direction of deeper biological factors that override empathy. These, for example, may involve the role of alpha leaders and their followers, and tribal dynamics that result in the need to hate, demonize and dehumanize. "

I don't find this as practical for the ""layperson"" as some books on the idea of evil and the human brain and mind are. Still you may find it draws you in a bit.I think how this one hits you will depend on your own bent and interests. I picked it up after reading a few books on Psychopathy. That's not exactly what's discussed here, but it is interesting."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17817291-tim,4,"An attempt to explain evil from an empirical standpoint rather than an ideological or a philosophical one. The author is only dealing with a certain type of evil; not natural evil (things like earthquakes and flooding) but moral evil (things like murder and rape). In a move parallel to Augustine of Hippo, he defines evil in terms of privation. Just as one might define darkness as the absence of light, Augustine defined evil as the absence of good, and Baron-Cohen defines it as the absence of empathy. There is a continuum between light and darkness. People are not either staring directly into the sun or trapped in a lightless grotto deep beneath the earth at any given moment (I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the fact that a person who is staring at the sun and a person trapped in a lightless room are equally blind serves as a useful metaphor for the dangers of extremism). One can parallel the light/dark continuum with the continuum between empathy and a lack of empathy in the psychology of individual human beings. It is by using this continuum that the author tries to better understand human evil. The author considers two ways of relating to the world, the Ich-Du (I-you) mode of being and the Ich-Es (I-it) mode of being. In the first mode of being you connect with another person as the end in itself. A highly empathetic person would operate in this mode of being since they would have the ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. In the second mode of being you connect with another person as a means to an end. They are not a person so much as an object to be used in the pursuit of some purpose. A person without empathy operates entirely in the Ich-Es mode of being. People are things. The author writes: 'Treating other people as if they were just objects is one of the worst things you can do to another human being, to ignore their subjectivity, their thoughts and feelings.' As the old chest nut goes, you can love people and use things or love things and use people.A mistake we might make is thinking once again that these are binary options. The author uses the helpful metaphor of a light switch. It is not a matter of whether we are in the off position (Ich-Es) or the on position (Ich-Du) because people are not like traditional light switches that must be entirely in one of these states or the other. They are more like dimmer switches. Empathy erosion is like a person who has the dimmer switch turned low, either as a temporary state or as a permanent trait. In his words: 'I'm going to argue that some people are at the low end of this empathy dimension in a potentially permanent way, and that some (but not all) of those at this extreme end are whom we might call “evil” or cruel. That is, they never had much empathy and they may never. Others may be at the low end of the empathy dimension because they experienced a transient shutting down of their empathy as the result of their current situation. That is, they had empathy and lost it, however briefly. But however you get to this low point on the empathy scale, the result can be the same. At that point you become capable of dehumanizing other people, of turning other people into objects, and this can have tragic consequences.'The author rightly points out that saying people engage in certain behaviours because they are evil is a sort of non-explanation: 'Why did the murderer kill the innocent child? Because he was evil. Why did the terrorist become a suicide bomber? Because she was evil.' The empirical approach he advocates is not content to merely slap a label on this type of behaviour and be done with it but is an attempt to understand how some people are capable of behaving in ways that other people find abhorrent. To do this he substitutes the phrase 'empathy erosion' where we would usually place the word evil. He then asks two questions: 1) What is empathy? 2) Why do some people have less than others?He writes: 'Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention.' You actively step out of your perspective and to the best of your ability step into the perspective of the other. Here is a real world example the author gives: 'I sat in Alyth Gardens synagogue in Golders Green in north London last year. Two men went up on the stage. The first one spoke. “I am Ahmed, and I am a Palestinian. My son died in the Intifada, killed by an Israeli bullet. I come to wish you all Shabbat Shalom.” Then the other man spoke. “I am Moishe, and I am an Israeli. My son also died in the Intifada, killed by a homemade petrol bomb thrown by a Palestinian teenager. I come to wish you all Salaam Aleikem.”I was shocked: Here were two fathers, from different sides of the political divide, united by their grief and now embracing each other's language. How had they met? Moishe had taken the opportunity offered by a charity called the Parents Circle for Israelis and Palestinians to make free phone calls directly into each other's homes to express their empathy to bereaved parents on the other side of the barbed-wire fence. Ahmed described how he had been at home in Gaza one day when the phone rang. It was Moishe, at that time a stranger in Jerusalem, who had taken that brave first step. They both openly wept on the phone. Neither had ever met or spoke to someone from the other community, but both told the other they knew what the other was going through.'The book delves a fair bit into the brain based aspect of empathy, identifying ten areas of the brain that are associated with the ability to empathize with other people. Much of this area of research is based on the behaviour of people that have suffered damage to these areas of the brain. The author also examines studies on whether there are correlations between how active any of these areas are and the level of empathy a particular individual demonstrates.Four types of non-empathetic people are examined in depth, three that the author identifies as level 0 negative personalities (borderline personality disorder, psychopathy, and narcissism) and one level 0 positive personality (Asperger's Syndrome). The author then goes on to consider the role of genetic and environmental factors in how empathetic any particular individual is. As is often the case in behavioural studies, comparing the behaviour of identical and non-identical twins is considered, and also whether adopted children end up sharing more in common with their birth parents or their adopted parents. The book also looks at empathy in the animal kingdom.The book ends with a number of questions for further study: Are evil acts always the result of early environmental factors (emotional deprivation) or biological factors (genes and/or hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.) affecting the empathy circuit? If empathy is missing in childhood or adolescence, can it be developed later? The role of biology and environment in fashioning the self you are is an interesting question in itself. It is kind of hard to deny they play a very large role in making you the self that you are but a further question is this: can the self that you are then turn around and take a conscious hand in fashioning who it is? I am inclined to say yes.I mostly agree with what the author has to say in this book. The biggest problem I have with it is that though it is only a partial explanation, it is presented in a way that lulls you into thinking it is a complete explanation. One could easily imagine situations where it is your experiencing empathy for another person that could lead to morally ambiguous actions so whatever empirical approach you might want to take to understanding evil, there are clearly more facets to it than a lack of empathy. The fact that he spends a portion of the book discussing non-empathic people that are not malevolent demonstrates that there are other factors to consider. Evil requires a better explanation than the mere absence of something. It clearly has positive (in the sense of existent) qualities of its own. To steal a metaphor from Dorothy L. Sayers, the categories are not Hamlet and non-Hamlet, they are Hamlet and anti-Hamlet."

This book broke down the science of the condition, explaining how that we are all not, either good or bad, but rather in measure, we are all a mixture of both. I'm reminded of the cartoon I used to see where every person has an invisible little angel on one shoulder and a little devil on the other, each trying to persuade us to do either right or wrong. Simon used a scale, breaking down the difference between those who only had minor deficiencies in expressing empathy and those who lack it completely. A lot of the signs are characteristics that I recognize in people I have known throughout my life; some to a greater extent than others. I thought the part that was most disturbing was the realization that those who are at the lowest scale in lacking empathy can not only be extremely heartless and cruel, but in most cases, do not even realize that they are being that way. Their brains are not wired to make the distinction. A person who could hurt, or possibly even kill, for whatever exaggerated reason and not feel the slightest regret or even understand that what they have done is wrong, is about as scary a monster as I can imagine. Over all this was an informative read on the subject, and I have a much clearer understanding now of my ex-wife."
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5244888-nina,4,"I have approached writing this book review several times and have hesitated ...This book was extremely difficult for me to review because it is a nice, neat, concise little package, which I felt was rather suspect considering the daunting topic of providing an explanation for human cruelty. I expected complexity, but I almost feel as if Baron-Cohen has provided a simple “no brainer”: people who are capable of cruelty lack empathy. Honestly though, he goes a little further and he groups his findings into neat categorizations, which are admittedly quite intriguing. He talks specifically about personality “disorders”, three in particular, and how they all involve impaired empathy as one of their traits. Baron-Cohen writes neatly and tidily and presents his theories very simply and attainably for the lay reader.I suppose my real difficulty, in the process of creating a review, was accepting his theories. At best, I think what Baron-Cohen has done is put the available pieces of a puzzle together and extrapolated what was missing, to create a partial picture of what is occurring on a societal and personal level with regards to people with impaired empathy. I think what is missing is the complete science, the complete understanding of the intricacies of the internal functions of the brain. Baron-Cohen layers in some psychology with the explanation of each “zero empathy” case, what makes them unique, and summarizes his theories will a philosophical final chapter. Nice, neat, right? The problem is that which is classified as “borderline” is neither simple, neat nor concise. There are borderlines who do not harm others in the extreme way as in the singular example. There are also psychopaths who exude empathy, enough in fact to lure and trap victims. They ARE reading people, whether their neural activity is demonstrating so or not. Meanwhile people with Asperger’s Syndrome are kind of the anomaly, there is a distinction making them zero empathy positive: morals. Yet, the very existence of morals demands an understanding of empathy. Morals are social rules; social rules are learned or understood mainly through empathy. Or so it would seem?In addition to categorizing minds and personalities along a spectrum of empathy, Baron-Coen goes further to suggest that conventional systems of justice should not be applicable to certain kinds of zero empathy behavior, especially when the person committing the offense suffers from conditions such as autism. Baron-Cohen suggests an inherent lack of moral agency in a person suffering from autism, based on the fact that in an autistic mind the empathy circuit had been negatively impacted. Without empathy autistic people might be inclined to commit socially inappropriate acts. However, in his view they should not be held responsible according to classical retributive justice systems because if their mind is impaired they lack the requisite moral agency to know how to better behave. This argument is of course interlaced with the debate on free will and human consciousness. Baron-Cohen clearly acknowledges this and also the fact that, in the case of grave crime, restoring a sense of justice is crucial for ensuring societal peace. The final issue which was not addressed much in the book, are the evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of possessing empathy or lacking empathy. While some theorists argue that empathy is at the root of human survival, others believe that the capability for switching off the empathy circuit could be to an evolutionary advantage. One thing was clear when reading Baron-Cohen’s sensitive writing on the subject; he is a scientist, a systematized thinker, with a clear and genuine function of empathy. I learned much from this book and it is recommended reading for any interested in psychology and neuroscience."
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,4,"I picked up this book because the dust jacket mentioned the role of mirror neurons in how people understand one another. Baron-Cohen argues that mirror neurons are only a small part of a more elaborate system he calls the empathy circuit. Using a questionnaire (a copy of which is in the book) that measures empathy, what he calls the empathy quotient, he focuses on those who measure zero. As you might anticipate, psychopaths are on this end of the scale. What is interesting is that he also places borderline personalities and the narcissistic personalities there as well. He calls this group zero negative, meaning, they measure zero in empathy and have negative personality traits. Naturally, there are a range of scores that can be found in these groups and, when you look at the questions used in the instrument and try to imagine someone who scores zero, you know they are, thankfully, rare. Perhaps more interesting though, he describes those with Asperger's syndrome and autism as zero positive, meaning that though they have zero empathy, they do not generally hurt others. Rather, they choose to avoid social situations altogether. They may be strong in something he calls the systemizer quotient meaning they are able to see patterns where others don't.These classifications are underpinned by reference to neuroimaging studies that have focused on those areas of the brain that have been found to be involved in empathy. Those who score low or zero in empathy have underactive empathy pathways as demonstrated by these studies.The framework described here leads to lots of questions: what problems are encountered by people who score very high on the EQ? What environmental cues are important in encouraging and empathic state (as distinct from trait)? This is especially interesting in the health care setting where, I expect we have many situations that blunt people who are normally empathic. However, is it always useful to be very empathic? If a surgeon were to be highly empathic, would he/she be able to do their job? "

I think I only missed out two chapters in the end but ohh boy, this is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read, smartly written, entertaining and very informative! It even debunks to an extent the idea that those with autism spectrum disorder and psychopathy don't have any empathy, rather, they both lack a specific type of empathy (autism cognitive empathy, psychopaths affective empathy) which has vastly different effects on the brain and behaviour - a really interesting conclusion rooted in evidence with potentially huge ramifications if it is correct. I found myself buzzing with interest and excitement while reading this. Would 100% recommend to anyone interested in empathy, cruelty, autism and personality disorders. Definitely don't need to go into this with any psychology knowledge either because it's so well written, engaging and accessible. Hopefully I can go back and read those last few chapters one day. :)Favourite Quote:'This suggests people with Asperger Syndrome are the mirror image of those with Type P: Psychopaths have intact cognitive empathy but reduced affective empathy, whilst people with Asperger Syndrome have intact affective empathy but reduced cognitive empathy. The result is that people with Asperger Syndrome do care about others, whilst struggling to 'read' them. Those with Type P don't care about others, whilst 'reading' them with ease.'"

The environment vs. genetics issues are explored and how a deadly mixture of both may create the monsters who engage in cruel acts. But the book also explores the minds of people who seem to lack empathy, but do not commit evil acts, because they have a very structured moral code. (People who fall somewhere on the autism spectrum.) As the mother of a 27-year-old man who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, I was struck by how much my son DIDN'T resemble the Asperger's Syndrome individuals Baron-Cohen discusses: my son has clearly shown empathy for others on a number of occasions. So either there's a broad spectrum within Asperger's, too, or - my son has something other than Asperger's. Baron-Cohen's argument that anorexics fall somewhere in the spectrums mentioned above, because they show a lack of empathy for their anguished parents, failed to persuade me of its correctness. "

21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409682-oscar,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen addresses the question of evil with an emphasis on moving away from biblical or religious theories towards scientific and psychiatric explanations. Baron-Cohen argues that much of what can constitute cruelty towards others is a result of a lack of empathy, that is, lacking feeling towards the victim and seeing them more or less as objects. In the book, Baron-Cohen argues that empathy exists on a spectrum, and while anyone can lack empathy for a brief moment, the book argues that three personality types which are borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial have zero empathy and seem prone towards act of cruelty. Baron-Cohen then looks at physiological, genetic, and environmental factors that lead to such personalities and takes a look at how such people's lack of empathy might lead to behaviors that might be deemed as evil. The book, then, complicates things by looking beyond such personalities and looking at people on the autistic spectrum, who lack empathy, but are not necessarily prone to cruelty. The book, moreover, also looks at cruel actions that seem to have been perpetrated by groups or individuals that do not have either of the three personality types.I was fascinated by the discussion of the book and believe that its strength lies largely in its discussion, observations, and philosophy towards the concept of empathy and how it serves to encourage evil and cruel behavior. If anything, I believe, that the book could have continued and expanded its discussion, but a useful foundation on the topic was presented, and it will undoubtedly push readers to ask further questions regarding the complicated conceptualization of evil in humanity. "
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601231-michael-george,5,"The Science of EvilS. Baron-CohenBasic Books, 2011What is evil? This is a question that is addressed in the first chapter of this book. The point of view is adopted to discuss this from the standpoint of a lack of empathy. In the second chapter, empathy is discussed as if it were a measurable characteristic, with a variation in the human population characterized by a “bell-shaped curve”. The concept of “empathy quotient”, or EQ, is introduced, and we are introduced to a questionnaire whose results can be assessed quantitatively, and which can be used to measure empathy. With respect to this questionnaire, the author refers to a research paper, by S. Baron-Cohen and S. Wainwright, entitled “The Empathy Quotient (EQ): An investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences” from the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, vol. 34, pages 163 – 175 (2004). Prof. Baron-Cohen asserts that empathy can be studied from a neuroscience perspective, and that there are specific brain structures, which he refers to as the “empathy circuit” that relate to empathy. He calls EQ results that are very low, zero degrees of empathy.Prof. Baron-Cohen considers what it would mean to associate a lack of empathy with evil. First, he wishes to show that the brain regions of the empathy circuit are noticeably low-functioning in people who can be identified as having very low EQs. Next, he seeks to clarify the psychology of the people who score very low EQs. Does this psychology relate to acts of cruelty? In addition, he wishes to study this from the medical point of view as a possible pathology. Is very low EQ inevitably associated with human cruelty? This is a very important question because, of course, EQ can be objectively measured. The author explores this question in chapters 3 and 4 of his book. In Chap. 3 he outlines evidence that couples with very low EQ that indicates the possibility of making certain correspondences with violence, aggression, and possible acts of cruelty in human beings. In Chapter 4, he points to a whole category of individuals with low EQs who, far from behaving cruelly, seem to display quite gentle, humane and non-aggressive dispositions. It is this categorical type of association in which he is interested. People with certain identifiable psychological types, and with correlated very low EQs can be studied scientifically, for example, by using the methods of neuroscience.Evidently, these identifiable psychological types have been sculpted by our biology, through genetics and environmental processes, mainly from early childhood. Therefore, having discussed types that seem to be associated with very low EQ, the author investigates, in Chapter 5, genetic correlates, and biological correlates. Prof. Baron-Cohen recognizes it as ideal to make these biological associations, to bring to bear well-developed capabilities of science.Having demonstrated the possibility of a science of evil, and discussed progress that has been made, in the last chapter of the book, the Prof. Baron-Cohen tries to capture the science in a broader perspective. An important consideration is what the consequences of a science of evil would mean.The early chapters in the book, laying the groundwork and discussing the possibility for the science are very important. However, let us focus on this last chapter. This is Chapter 6 and it is called “Reflections on Human Cruelty”. Certainly, when one thinks about evil, one associates it, in terms of its contrast with good, with moral philosophy or with religion, not with science. Prof. Baron-Cohen was hoping to introduce science in terms of ten points he discusses in the last chapter of his book.The first point is associated with empathy, in that, in having an EQ, or empathy quotient, from taking the survey he and his associates developed, one can place oneself on a spectrum from low EQ to high. This EQ, more fundamentally, from a scientific perspective, is related to our biology. With respect to evil, Prof. Baron-Cohen focused, and this is his second point, on very low EQ, and asked the question whether there are recognizable psychological types associated with low EQ. He is able to associate, with what he calls Zero-Negative, three types: P, N and B. These are highly recognizable types that are ordinarily regarded as psychological disorders. The word “zero” in Zero-Negative is meant to suggest the relationship to very low EQ and the word “Negative” is meant to imply that people in these categories are associated with pathological psychological behavior.In one of the appendices of his book and in Chapter 3, Prof. Baron-Cohen gives brief descriptions to help recognize these types. Type P, for example, which is associated with psychopathic personality disorder, is associated with:Superficial charm;Lack of anxiety or guilt;Undependability and dishonesty;Egocentricity;Inability to form lasting intimate relationships;Failure to learn from punishment;Poverty of emotions;Lack of insight into the impact of their behavior;Failure to plan ahead.Such criteria are matters of degree, and clearly depend somewhat on the subjective judgment of the observer. However, the claim is that this, with more precise clinical designations, is a medical pathology recognizable to trained psychiatrists. Similarly, type N, associated with narcissistic personality disorder, and type B, associated with borderline personality disorder, are claimed by the author to be conditions subject to diagnostic criteria of pathologies, and not strictly subjective categories.The third point that the author wishes to emphasize is that these recognizable types, when subjected to standard neuroscience procedures, tend to display atypical patterns of responses in the “circuitry” of the brain associated with empathy. The fact that atypical responses are indicated gives a diagnostic tool for these categories. A fourth point is that once one has associated behavior with brain circuitry, treatments are suggested which might alter these responses, and possibly affect an improvement in the psychological condition, in itself. For example, people with autism also tend to score very low EQs and have atypical brain responses in empathy circuitry, but are not Zero-Negative. In Prof. Baron-Cohen’s researches on autism, his research group developed educational software for autistic children that has led to changes in these brain responses and higher EQs. It is possible that the same might also be observed for people who are Zero-Negative. The fact that brain circuitry is very complex, and not likely to be subject to any conscious control that might deceive psychiatrists is significant in this regard.One startling finding from psychology about the types P and B is that quite often it is found that the environments people of these types were subject to were abusive or very harsh. This correlation relates to the author’s fifth point. We certainly cannot ascribe a causal relation to a statistical correlation. However, results of psychological observations certainly suggest that a nurturing environment as a child may be highly correlated with a substantial EQ, or a high degree of empathy. Prof. Baron-Cohen says this can lead to what is observed as early secure attachment, and “can be understood as an internal pot of gold”.Prof. Baron-Cohen makes five further important points:There are genes for empathy;One category of low EQ is not associated with pathology, but is actually positive: Zero-Positive, associated with autism spectrum conditions;Zero-Positive is the result of a mind constantly striving to step out of time, to set aside the temporal dimension in order to see – in stark relief – the eternal repeating patterns of nature;The Zero-Positive mind finds change toxic;Empathy is the most valuable resource in our world;Having made these assertions, the author discusses some outstanding puzzles that remain. The author feels that he has just begun to explore interesting questions and that many remain. For example, one obvious and pertinent question is: Are there other categories that are identifiably low EQ?Since Prof. Baron-Cohen has discussed the fact that certain pathologies can be tied to specific diagnostic features of an empathy circuit, he also wishes to consider the extent to which this low EQ type of diagnoses can be incorporated or has been incorporated into psychiatry. He discusses this in the context of the DSM-IV (“Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”, fourth ed.), which is one of the most important reference books that psychiatrists consult in their diagnoses. He is interested in introducing an “empathy disorder” category in this book, and he discusses what this might mean with respect to certain types of criminal activity, which he believes relates to low empathy. He discusses this both in relation to people who commit crimes who are evidently Zero-Negative, as well as in relation to people involved in criminal activity who are Zero-Positive, and he definitely believes that, with respect to punishments, when people are committing a crime that seems to be related to their lack of empathy, that a certain level of compassion in meting out their punishment would be wise. These are speculative issues that Prof. Baron-Cohen is discussing, and he does point out that, at the time of writing his book, there was no plan to introduce an empathy disorder category in the next edition of the DSM. It should be mentioned that empathy is discussed in DSM-IV, for example, in the narcissistic personality disorder (which is the type N that Prof. Baron-Cohen studied), however, there is no specific empathy disorder category.A very interesting issue discussed by Prof. Baron-Cohen in this last chapter of his book is the “banality of evil”, first noted by the political theorist Hannah Arendt on observing the trial of the Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, in a Jerusalem court. In this context, one pictures the accommodation people can make, when they are a part of a long chain of small acts that end or begin in cruelty, an acquiescence to authority or part of a greater group conformity. Here, one is dealing with ordinary people, performing unempathic acts. Is it possible that people with average EQs can “switch off” their empathy temporarily? This brings up even deeper questions of possible implications for evil or cruel acts of just the typical person. This counterintuitive notion means that evil or the refraining from evil acts, is not necessarily something that can be addressed by science. However, the question of an “underactive” empathy circuit in the brain is manifested in this, and Prof. Baron-Cohen dedicates a section of the chapter to this.There definitely seem to be certain biological events and factors, that can manifest themselves at critical points in a person’s life, often in early childhood, that can irreversibly drive the empathy circuit toward atypical responses. Furthermore, Prof. Baron-Cohen stresses that changes in this circuitry, whether irreversible or not, can be correlated with systemizing behavior versus empathic responses. Does this mean that a correlation is being established at a scientific level to what we regard as evil or cruel behavior?In bringing up the point about irreversibility, Prof. Baron-Cohen is induced, in the next section of the chapter to consider the extent to which changes in EQ or empathy, as indicated by responses in brain circuitry, can be reversed. Prof. Baron-Cohen, in the face of knowledge of crimes, criminals and criminal behavior, maintains a somewhat positive attitude, as he expresses here, through a quote from one of his friends, Peter Lipton, given as part of a sermon: “If we treat another person as emotionally bad, we dehumanize him or her. If we take the view that every human being has some good in them, even if it is only 0.1 percent of their makeup, then by focusing on their good part, we humanize them. By acknowledging and attending to and rewarding their good part, we allow it to grow, like a small flower in a desert.”Basically, in considering the lack of empathy, we are anticipating more of a focus on systemization or logic. In the next section, Prof. Baron-Cohen briefly considers what it means as we allow empathy to have an increasing role. He pictures this as allowing the empathy circuit more of a role, and this, he speculates, permits us to mirror ourselves in another and allow us to see the other as less of an object and more alive to us. He then discusses briefly why the distribution for EQ is in the shape of a bell, if a heavier weighting for empathy is positive. Why are the “super” empathic rare? To a certain extent, the balance between empathy and systemizing occurs from biological pressures for survival, but as the author emphasizes in the last section of the book, where he discusses the ongoing strife between Israel and the Palestinians, empathy as a resource is somewhat taken for granted, and we often fail to recognize its benefits. He leaves us with a hopeful message: “Empathy is a universal solvent. Any problem immersed in empathy becomes solvable.”The book is well-structured, and well-edited, with the beginning paragraph of each chapter serving to bring us into the concerns of the chapter, and the last paragraph providing a message or perspective for us. The chapter titles are well-chosen, and the headings for each section in a chapter provide good descriptions for the discussion of that section. Furthermore, in one appendix, an EQ or empathy quotient survey is provided, so that we can gauge for ourselves the specifics of the measurement of empathy that Prof. Baron-Cohen and his co-workers have developed. For further exploration, he supplies us with references to a historical account of empathy by J. Rifkin and an evolutionary account by F. de Waal. The book Prof. Baron-Cohen has written is short, but his discussions about psychology and neuroscience are interesting at the level of the general educated person, and, although not a novel idea, his possible association of lack of empathy with evil and cruelty benefit from his scientific expertise in neuroscience and the study of autism. I recommend this book as an alternative focused on science to a consideration of evil focused on religion or moral philosophy, which would be independent of any bias for or against religious belief. He shows that the scientific point of view may have considerable value for us in our daily lives, in weighing the meaning of criminal of evil acts, and in assisting in psychiatric diagnoses and treatment."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122610-jef-sneider,3,"This is really not a book about evil. Believe the subtitle. The author makes his case that there are individuals who are hard wired, by genetics and development, to lack empathy and that 3 types of these individuals are capable of inflicting harm on others without considering the harm done. Three types of personality disorder fit into the most harmful category as we know it from standard psychological classifications: psychopathic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders. When fully expressed, people with each of these disorders really suffer from a lack of empathy. They are unable to feel or understand what another person feels. The author uses scientific evidence to show that empathy is wired into 10 different regions of our brains and that the brains of people who lack empathy show both anatomic variations and differences from ""normal"" on functional MRI scanning. For each of us, other people may be reduced to objects at times of stress. Soldiers in the heat of battle, must see the enemy, for better or worse, as an enemy, not a human being. Each of us, when stressed or hurried, might walk by a person lying on the street and not even notice the human being that is there. Sometimes shutting down our empathy circuits is a good thing, a positive adaptation. A surgeon needs to see only the problem she is working on, not the human being. All of these cases occur in everyday life. Most people are capable of recognizing, at least in retrospect, that we have caused harm by objectifying others. We can experience regret, remorse and even shame for our actions. This is not so with those who truly lack empathy. Their behavior shows that they treat other people as objects to be manipulated, and their thoughts often conform without regret and without shame. Of course, a lack of empathy alone does not lead to evil actions. The author argues that environmental factors and opportunity combined with a lack of empathy can lead to some awful actions, including abuse, neglect, and murder. Examples are cited which are real, and they just make me shake my head. We know that there are people who do evil. We just can't understand it.Simon Baron-Cohen helps us to understand how it is possible, due to a total lack of empathy, for a mother to neglect her children, for a father to rape his daughter and keep her locked up for years and for a gang member to rape and murder without remorse. Unfortunately, he is less helpful helping us figure out to do with knowledge based on his theories and evidence. The people he describes would generally be thought of as ""bad people"" who do bad things and should be punished or just locked away to keep the rest of us safe. Or should they? Can people who are biologically lacking in empathy be rehabilitated? Can they change? Can they learn empathy? Are they responsible for their crimes? With a few quick remarks about the death penalty and philosophy, the book draws to a conclusion. This has left me with an uneasy feeling. I am uneasy just being reminded that there are people out there who can commit crimes and hurt people as a matter of course, with no thoughts to the feelings of their victims. I know these people exist. I know that they do bad things. I just find that explaining their evil actions using a fixed biological and scientific framework leaves me with a very negative and depressing and hopeless view of the world. How can we escape the biology of ruthless killers in the world? To paraphrase Jack Nicholson's character speaking in the movie A Few Good Men, ""We can't handle the truth!"" He may be right."

The book flows nicely from one chapter to the next.4.	Limited but good use of charts and figures.5.	Does a great job of establishing the expectations of the book. “In this book I explore how people can treat each other cruelly not with reference to the concept of evil, but with reference to the concept of empathy. Unlike the concept of evil, empathy has explanatory power. In the coming chapters I put empathy under the microscope.”6.	Provides four examples of empathy erosion. Memorable accounts.7.	Defines the key term of the book to satisfaction, “Empathy is our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.” “This suggests there are at least two stages in empathy: recognition and response.”8.	The seven likely settings of the Empathizing Mechanism. From level 0 where the individual has no empathy at all to level 6 where individuals show remarkable empathy.9.	Great use of current science to make compelling arguments. “There is a consensus in neuroscience that at least ten interconnected brain regions are involved in empathy (and more may await discovery).” Explains in an accessible manner these brain regions and their relationship with empathy.10.	The three forms of Zero-Negative: Zero-Negative Borderline (Type B), Zero-Negative Psychopath (Type P), and Zero-Negative Narcissist (Type N). Provides case studies for each one. “The hallmark of borderlines is a constant fear of abandonment, emotional pain and loneliness, hatred (of others and of themselves), impulsivity, and self-destructive, highly inconsistent behavior.”11.	Explores the causes of the Zero-Negative degrees of empathy. “Common within families of children who later grow up to become borderline are incest, child abuse, violence, and alcoholism. Obviously, the link between child abuse and borderline is not total: Not all who are abused go on to become borderline, and not all those who are borderline were abused.”12.	The difference between the psychopath and borderline behavior. “When we meet the psychopath, we see a person who shares that same total preoccupation with oneself as we saw in Type B. But in this case there is a willingness to do whatever it takes to satisfy their desires.”13.	Interesting facts. “About 15 percent of prison samples are psychopaths and just less than 1 percent of males in the general population.”14.	A look at Zero-Positive degrees of empathy. “Zero-Positive means that alongside difficulties with empathy, these individuals have remarkably precise, exact minds. They have Asperger Syndrome, a condition on the autistic spectrum.”15.	A look at the autistic brain, a sensitive topic treated with respect. “In addition to difficulty in understanding others, people who are Zero-Positive have difficulty understanding their own minds, a difficulty called “alexithymia,” which translates as “without words for emotion.””16.	The two ways to systemize. “The first is by observation alone. We observe the changing data and then look for a pattern in the data. The second way we systemize is by observation plus operation. We observe the data and then perform some operation (manipulating one variable) and observe the effect of that operation.”17.	A look at the new evidence that environmental factors interact with “genes for empathy.” “In the “right” environment someone with the genetic predisposition to psychopathy could show this behavior.” “Some scientists have focused their search for empathy genes on those that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin. Too much serotonin in the synapse has been linked to aggression.”18.	Presents ten new ideas that focus on empathy erosion versus “evil”. 19.	A look at superempathy. 20.	Provides supplementary material on the empathy quotient and how to spot zero degrees of empathy (negative). Negatives:1.	Neuroscience is in its infancy and as a result the book may not have the feel of a hard science but I thought the author didn’t oversell what we currently know. 2.	There are some topics that were barely touched, as an example, aggression in males versus females. Aggression and how it varies by culture.3.	I would like to see an update to the book so that the author can address some of the criticism.4.	An appendix explaining the author’s methodology would have been helpful.In summary, I enjoyed this book. This is a very interesting topic and Baron-Cohen treats the topic fairly without overselling what we currently know. Though the author left many fruits on the tree what’s in the book is very good. I recommend it.

Baron-Cohen found the common factor linking borderline personality disorder (type P), psychopathic/ antisocial personality disorder (type P), narcissistic personality disorder (type N), and autism/Asperger's. He found that types B, P, and N were far more of a concern than Asperger's. While he acknowledged the difficulty of Autism at the more severe end of this spectrum, he cautioned against pathologizing different ways of thinking. Best discussion of autism I have read to date. There were a few things that bothered me, all of which seem to be common in books dealing with human behavior. For example, he could have been more critical when discussing twin studies. He managed to convey some criticisms but wholly ignored others, such as epigenetic regulation of genes, similar twin environments despite separation from birth parents and siblings, etc. When discussing MAOA alleles, he gave the briefest overview and omitted critical information, such as the fact that in the absence of abuse, the ""warrior"" copy of MAOA actually results in *lower* aggression levels. He could have been more specific about the role of maltreatment in gene development (BDNF or other brain building regions that contribute to impulse control).Even with those concerns, relative to other books available on these subjects, Baron-Cohen is easily one of the best.

(Are psychopaths, borderlines and narcissists all truly ""zero empathy?"" I doubt it.) But he presents his case fairly well, and every genuine voice in the battle against ""evil"" deserves a hearing.Baron-Cohen's work in The Science of Evil rests on the narrow fence between pop psychology and serious research. And with glaring flaws like the twice-made proposition that the words ""evil"" and ""empathy"" can be substituted one for another (wha?), I was left less impressed with the seriousness of the book than carried along by a competent, if sometimes a bit dry, voice. However, once I got to the author's notes at the end of the book, I found the engaging writer I should have met in the first chapter, and I wondered why such human touches were buried in the back of the book.Baron-Cohen marries scientific research and religious impulse well in the final sections of the book, and makes a solid moral case for refusing to give up on any living human being, no matter the evil they may have displayed. So it's obvious he's coming at this subject from a purely academic, and not a personal, point of view. As for me, I think I prefer my old-school black and white, shake-the-dust way of looking at evil. In my rear-view mirror. "

Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

45,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."

My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."

I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
52,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "

(Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "

And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."

The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."

He has helped me quite a bit in gaining a more distanced and analytical perspective of the psychological dynamics of what can be considered ""evil"" behavior.However, he focuses on Psychopathic/Narcissistic/Borderline personality disorders. As well as extreme Asperger and Autism cases and does not really become involved in behaviors related to war crimes, and terrorism. Nothing that would really explain brutal and horrific crimes. He speaks a lot to Holocaust but explains it merely by people being distanced from the overall outcomes. People doing their small part, without making the connection to the overall genocide. Maybe, this is a good psychological explanation for the holocaust (I am not sure). However, for example, this does not explain crimes against women in the middle east, nor other genocides which wore more directly carried out by what were average people. According to him, a small percentage of the population is genetically predisposed to low empathy or this is triggered by a terrible childhood... he makes it seem like, this affects a small percentage of society. But when we see general inequality and country wide neglect of human rights (against women for example) his explanation and work seems not large scale enough..And so I feel this book was incomplete in providing a scientific explanation for ""Evil"" behavior.

Texas gun laws were ambiguous about open and concealed carry in churches. He thought that people should take their guns to church and that Texas law should unambiguously allow them to do so. Asked about what causes such mass gun casualties (remember, this is just four weeks after a gunman killed 59 and wounded about 500 in Las Vegas), the head of Texas Carry thought that riots and disrespect for police was the answer.All that is stupid nonsense of course. But the problem of evil in the world is not nonsense. Now that we inhabit a full-bore gun culture (no pun intended), we Americans are sunk in perpetual foreign wars, subjected to news of deaths that most cultures would be shocked by, and numbed by constant hate to the point that our President (Trump) says only that “now is not the time” to talk about it. The President does, however, sometimes call mass shooters “degenerate” or “evil”, succumbing to non-reflexive instinct in a search for either natural (“degenerate”) or transcendent (“evil”) explanations. One thing the President cannot do is to look inside himself; nor, it seems, can many of us. But, what is it about the culture surrounding these horrible events that gives rise to mass shootings and gun violence in general?The two books under consideration here do look inside “us” to examine the culture of evil and cruelty. Andrew Delblanco’s superb book “The Death of Satan” is a highly readable survey, by Columbia University’s Professor of Humanities, of the literary, social and cultural landscape surrounding America’s engagement with the Devil and how American thinkers and writers have come to grips with the ever-present history of war, torture, murder, and other forms of human cruelty. Delblanco’s basic premise is that: “A gulf has opened up in our culture between the visibility of evil and the intellectual resources available for coping with it.” Citing a “crisis of incompetence before evil”, Delblanco traverses the centuries from Puritanism to Science, and finds that the Devil has disappeared and that Americans, “having discarded the old words and symbols” have arrived “at an unprecedented condition of inarticulate dread.” Those of us interested in the present debate about the Gun Culture (not about guns, but about an entire culture addicted to guns and other violence) can hardly ignore the fact that neither religion nor science can adequately explain what is happening in our churches, schools, nightclubs, workplaces, streets and homes. Delblanco discusses a wide array of writers and thinkers—Emerson, Melville, Cotton Mather, Hemingway, Lincoln, Kierkegaard, Primo Levi, Dewey and Lippman, to name just a few. “Getting a handle” on evil, as Delblanco argues, has been a major theme in American literature and art. These days, Delblanco would say that we as a culture have lost our mutual ability (as a society) to agree on any terms of transcendence for our shared values. Gun advocates argue that we need more guns to combat the guns in the hands of “evil doers”. Some argue that we need regulation. Some might raise their hands in surrender. But make no mistake, Delblanco’s wonderful book is a reminder about how much we’ve lost to violence and evil when a disappeared Devil can compose such a score and have us all dancing to his tune from somewhere off the stage.While Delblanco’s “Death of Satan” is an invaluable book for those interested in America’s historical thinking about evil (and a book that could stimulate much useful debate), Simon Baron-Cohen’s “The Science of Evil” rejects transcendental or metaphysical speculation in favor of a strictly scientific explanation of evil, or what Baron-Cohen (a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at Cambridge) calls “empathy erosion”. “Empathy is not the only component that contributes to cruelty” Baron-Cohen writes, “but…it is the final common pathway.” Empathy erosion is, in scientific terms, the only thing about “evil” that is measurable or observable, and thus the only thing that can be reasonably discussed as a causal factor in any kind of cruel act. Baron-Cohen describes the considerable research done into the ways and means behind how some people become capable of cruelty and “whether the loss of affective (emotional) empathy “inevitably has this consequence.” Cohen’s book describes the abundant research results from neurobiology and gene dynamics to take a close look at the medical conditions leading to a loss of empathy. At issue is the behavior of psychopaths, sociopaths, and narcissists, who demonstrate a “Zero-Negative” empathy level, meaning that each of these categories of persons suffer from medical illnesses that disallow them from recognizing the emotions of other people. Along the way, Cohen discusses people diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome and Autism, “Zero-Positives” who have a affective connections to other’s emotions, but who cannot cognitively process “other minds”.Cohen’s book leaves a barren impression, though its science is undoubtedly correct. But as an explanation for “evil in the World”, science falls short, at least emotionally, given that “cruelty” is only one limited kind of evil. Zeroing in on individuals who lack affective empathy (even if this can be observationally and scientifically proven) leaves out of the equation, for example, all those “good Germans” who watched the Jews disappear from their towns and villages, quietly observed them being marched to the trains, and gazed on as their ashes rose up as smoke out of tall chimneys all over Germany and Eastern Europe. Those were the Germans who loved their children, went to church, fed the dog, and listened to Mozart.These good Germans have a lot in common with we good Americans who all stand up during the national anthem. We’d best start asking ourselves and each other the right questions. "

When a person texts and drives, are they thinking empathetically or are they being selfish? What about the psychopath who can kill her own child in cold blood and then go about partying as if nothing has happened? The author of this study attempts to explore these phenomena in this book as he tries to redefine evil to mean an ""absence of empathy"". Of particular interest, is the idea that the scientist sees empathy has our world's most important resource - something that can be learned and something that can be eroded. He suggests that we don't take enough time to focus on protecting and developing empathy - as a culture and as individuals. In the book, itself, Cohen describes what zero-empathy looks like and how it differs between those with true mental disorders and those with disorders like autism - the difference is significant. Overall, the nonfiction book was quite interesting (and very expensive for a Nook purchase). I do wish, however, that the author would have gone a little furhter into answering questions about developing and eroding empathy as opposed to just proving that it is necessary in understanding the concept of evil.

It also provides useful information, almost in passing, for those concerned about the false statements over vaccines and autism. It shows how autism is linked to genes and physiological problems in the brain.Where I think the book may be lacking is any meaningful discussion of a possibility that some may harm others not because they have no concept of another's feelings, but because they do have that understanding, but enjoy hurting others - the role of the schoolyard or workplace bully (and possibly some in government and other positions of authority), or the dehumanising effects of being a faceless individual following orders (if you dress cops like stormtroopers they will behave like stormtroopers).This is a book to learn from."

There are also some quick and interesting starting-point remarks on the highly empathetic people amongst us (several ways of scoring and measuring the concepts are included in the book, as well as the basic definitions and traits for the already mentioned disorders, see it as many readers probably come from without the field of psychology/psychiatry), on how empathy is an important factor not just interpersonally but also on a macro societal level, and ...

I have long believed that so many problems in daily life--and in international strife--can often be reduced to basic issues of lack of empathy, so I was readily susceptible to the thesis that cruelty comes from a lack of empathy, and a lack of empathy comes from a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Advancing evidence of the genetic component elements are reviewed in the book, as are such ranging categories of response as autism, Asperger's Syndrome, borderline, psychopath, and narcissism.I agree with the simple to say but difficult to carry through conclusion the book moves toward, too: we need more compassion to start to solve problems big and small."

He then examines the personality disorders associated with these breakdowns, even going into autism/asperger's as it relates to empathy. There was a lot of good research (some original) that I found very illuminating.Ultimately though, I found his hypothesis to be a vast oversimplification. I wholeheartedly subscribe to the idea that evil (and morality in general) can be fully explained by way of psychological and neurological methods. I simply don't think we understand the subject sufficiently at this time. To the author's credit, he wholly acknowledges the need for much more research into these issues. All in all, I see this as a good stepping stone in the ongoing conversation about evil and morality.

He also contrasts what he calls ""zero negatives"" : Psychopaths, Narcissists and Borderliners with ""zero positives"" who's lack of empathy doesn't harm other people due to the way their brain systemizes information, like those with autism or Asperger's Syndrome. Everyone lies somewhere on the empathy scale, which is a classic bell-curve. One thing he does not discuss is how, with all things being equal, people still respond differently to different situations. For example, why do some people who are victims of hazing make it their duty to make sure everyone else suffers the same fate, while others go out of their way to ensure others DONT have to go through what they went through. Maybe he will cover this mechanism in future works.

Empathy now seems to be one of the quintessential variations that can define a character's conscious experience. The author seems to pull from various social fields such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology to help support his thesis of fallacies of the mind ranging from: Borderline Personality Disorder, Psycoticism, Narcissism, Autism, Asperger's syndrome - and paraphrased roughly, he feels that different degrees of empathy can lead you to one of these qualities of self. He also tackles empathy from a genetic standpoint, and when he provided research from primatology in the question of empathy's existence - it sealed the coffin of my skepticism towards empathy's existence.

Cohen makes some mention of twin studies, he admits that the ""nature versus nurture"" argument hasn't quite been resolved yet, he hedges some of his claims, but I think that he thinks he has stumbled across something that no one else had quite figured out properly (hence the ""new"") and this intellectual arrogance shows - one senses that ""theory"" was used begrudgingly in the subtitle.

His descriptions of people with borderline personality disorder in particular, or 'borderlines' as Baron-Cohen chooses to call them/us, is completely out of line with the rest of the recent literature on this subject. This is not because he has a unique ground-breaking insight, but rather because he is choosing to use stigmatising and false descriptions of this group of people which serve to reinforce negative stereotypes.

However, aside from a shocking beginning (i.e., with examples of Nazi evils--sorry, negative Zero-Empathy Nazi acts), this book is definitely about the science and a tad dry. Perhaps I just get enough of it at work, but discussions of the roles of the different areas of the brain in empathy did not hold my interest very well.

109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Simon Baron Cohen’s fundamental idea is that in order to prevent evil we must first understand its causes. How was Josef Fritzl capable of locking up his own daugter in his basement and then rape her on a daily basis for more than a decade? The typical reaction to this type of story is that Josef Fritzl is an evil man, and he did what he did because he was evil. But what does it mean when you say that someone is evil, and does deeming someone as an evil person have any positive side effects? These are of course difficult questions and I don’t think that Baron Cohen provides a complete answer to them (which would have been a lot to hope for). What Baron Cohen does claim is that if we want to prevent evil we must first understand it. He further suggests that individuals, such as Fritzl, who commit horrendous acts probably suffers from a lack of empathy, that is a lacking ability to see the world from another persons perspective. Borderline patients, psychopaths and narcissists are three mental disorders that have a common feature, namely zero empathy. In other words they are more or less incapable of seeing the world from another persons perspective and therefore they may not get the same “gut response” when they hear about Fritzl. Many people lack empathy, but not all of them endorse in “evil”. Other factors such as upbringing and attachments to caregivers can influence whether a person born with deficient empathy becomes an offender or learns how to follow the rules of society despite lacking some of the intuitions that derives from having empathy. Simon Baron Cohen’s expertize lies in the field of autism which is another mental dissorders characterized by a lack of empathy. Individuals that have a autism spectrum dissorder (this category includes those with asperger syndrome), also behave in ways that reveal a lack of empathy, however, they are often good at systematizing, that is seeing relationships between various variables in the world. Because of this special ability they have benefited the world in many waysRather than deeming individuals evil, we should try to understand why evil acts are committed. To look at people with a severe lack of empathy is a good and plausibly fruitful starting point for such an endeavour. Simon Baron Cohen, is a terrific writer with the ability to convey complex ideas and complex research findings in an accessible and easy to understand way. This book as well as “The essential difference” show that this is indeed the case. "
110,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15024040-jenn,5,"The alarming part for me of this book was that he says 1% of the population have zero empathy - that is in a population of 60 million 60,000 people - a lot! (At first I thought it was 600,000 until I re-did my maths, phew).Admittedly most of those 60,000 wouldn't commit violence because there is no reason for them to do so, but I imagine a fair number abuse their partners or have the potential to inflict great cruelty if the circumstance was right.I have a relative who I realise now fell into the borderline personality category - she had a chaotic life, always acting with great selfishness but punishing herself even more than wreaking everyone's lives around her (she eventually committed suicide). I always had the sense that part of her brain was missing, that somehow the empathetic part just wasn't there. She could be incredibly charming and good company but utterly selfish. Maybe if I had understood her better I might have been more sympathetic.The book clarified for me many factors which I have suspected for a long while - namely the fact that empathy is primarily genetic but there is a strong link between empathy and childhood. That the brain is an organ like any other organ, it may be monstrously complicated but it is physically shaped by the environment around it, in particular at the time of its development. I really liked the graphic at the end outlining the 12 factors affecting empathy, ranging from the physical (alcohol intake etc), neurological, genetic, anger and emotions (which I suppose runs under the category of hormones) to tribal, the in group/out group influences, childhood etc. Fascinating. And big implications for society as a whole - for instance cracking down on domestic violence could have the side effect of bringing down violent crime, what effect does war have on the children who have to live through it? And how can we help them?As a side note when my Mum suffered from dementia, she in no way ever lacking in empathy, but you could see parts of her brain dying - so she, who all her life had been careful about what she would say, was suddenly passing rude comments to people in supermarkets, which I suppose reflects one of Baron-Cohen's neurological trigger points malfunctioning. Horrible to see but again confirming the physical nature of the brain. We are just another mammal."

Just one of those comments that you hear once, and the thought never goes away. To a child’s mind (even to an adult’s) these two types of things just don’t belong together. He also told me the Nazis turned Jews into bars of soap. It sounds so unbelievable, yet it is actually true. I knew our family was Jewish, so this image of turning people into objects felt a bit close to home. My father also told me about one of his former girlfriends, Ruth Goldblatt, whose mother had survived a concentration camp. He had been introduced to the mother and was shocked to discover that her hands were reversed. Nazi scientists had severed Mrs. Goldblatt’s hands, switched them around, and sewn them on again so that if she put her hands out palms down, her thumbs were on the outside and her little fingers were on the inside. Just one of the many ‘experiments’ they had conducted. I realized there was a paradox at the heart of human nature—people could objectify others—that my young mind was not yet ready to figure out. […] Today, almost half a century after my father’s revelations to me about the extremes of human behavior, my mind is still exercised by the same, single question: How can we understand human cruelty.""Well, do you believe the stories about the lampshade, the soap, the switching of hands?

I wish the book had more stories or examples instead of dry scientific language. I was thinking to give three stars. Then, one statement of the author threw me off completely. In Chapter 6, the author mentions Adolph Hitler and then continues. “No one, however evil we paint them to be, should be treated as 100% bad or is beyond responding to a humane approach. The questions is whether we can push this notion to the logical conclusion. If unambiguously evil individuals, a candidate for this category might be Hitler, felt remorse for their and had been punished, would we try to focus on their good qualities with an intent to rehabilitate them. My own view is that we should do this no matter how bad their crime. It is the only way we can establish that we are showing empathy to the perpetrator, not just repeating a crime of turning the perpetrator into an object and thus dehumanizing them. But doing that we are no better than the person we punish.”Seriously?! We should have tendered 0.00000001% good in Hitler, so he would blossom as “the flower in the desert”? Then, the author talks about Ronnie Lee Gardner and how he was executed by a firing squad. I looked up the info for Gardner. He killed one man in robbery in 1984. In April 1985, while being moved to the court for his homicide hearing, he killed the attorney. In 1994, he stabbed his fellow inmate. Fortunately, the inmate survived. Then, the author raves how police officers could shoot this unarmed man tied to the chair. I guess if the author thinks that Hitler deserved the rehabilitation...... So only one star for this nonsense ending of the book."

114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61217472-eric-li,3,"It's not a revolutionary study. Indeed, I will call it incremental science at best.Baron-Cohen provides a novel perspective to look at evil/cruelty. He believes that ""loss of empathy"" underlies every horrific human acts that have been/will be committed. He explores the lower extreme of ""empathy spectrum"", suggesting that this group (of lower/nil empathy) can be subdivided to personalities such as borderline (B), narcism (N), psychopath (P), and zero-positive (systemizer). As one who does not have any psychology background, to learn about these categorization is a fun. Cohen points out that biological factors (genetics) as well as environmental factors (ideology, culture, and childhood experiences) contributes to permanent loss of empathy. Emotion can cause temporary loss. His argument is solid and well supported.When Baron-Cohen moves to suggest how we should treat individuals with zero empathy who committed crimes, his argument becomes weaker. I assume Cohen is not trained in ethics, and his perspective is a typical for middle class, liberal, well educated and no big events (e.g. close friends/relatives being hurt by psychopaths). Who should be hold responsible if criminals who luckily reversed their zero empathy and are given a second chance committed serious crime again? It's highly likely given their predisposition. ""Sorry for your loss"" and ""it's just bad luck"" do not seem enough for victim's family. When autonomy of an individual is in conflict with potential well beings of general public, who to sacrifice? Cohen mentioned before that this kind of moral situation is complex and hard to judge, then how can he voices out such suggestions at the end of his book?"
115,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60600424-kassy-harris,4,"This was a very interesting read although it was a little different than what I had expected. Because of the title, I was expecting something a little darker and more related towards the ideas of evil and the bad things that people do. However, Baron-Cohen's book is all about empathy. And to be honest, this was a very refreshing book on the ideas of ""evil."" Baron-Cohen is very adamant in clarifying his opinions and what they do or do not relate to and it's interesting to take his ideas and fit them into whatever thoughts you may have on your own. The more scientific chapters on neurology were a little dull if you don't have any prior experience with that field, but the rest of the book certainly makes up for it.I think Baron-Cohen's examples were the best part of the book. Each adage was taken from real events and used to express ideas that the author had in order to more easily relate them to the reader. There are examples of violence, but also examples of individuals with mental illness that may or may not contribute to acts of cruelty. That is not to say Baron-Cohen only focuses on the negative. On the contrary, he is very clear in identifying positive ways in which a lack of empathy can influence an individual (this was certainly one of the most interesting sections to me).Make sure you read until the end. To me, the last chapter (6) was the most interesting. This is where Baron-Cohen really takes all of his evidence and examples and sums it up into a nice conclusion.Definitely would recommend this to anyone with an interest in psychology and how the human brain can justify or simply not understand acts of ""evil."""
116,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68107697-andrew,4,"I enjoyed this book. It was well organized and an easy read considering the complexity of the science (neurology and genetics). The author begins with a fairly simple hypothesis; if "" you treat someone as an object, your empathy has been turned off"" and that is the final pathway to cruelty. He starts by identifying an empathy circuit in the brain. Borderline, psychopaths, narcissists, autism and Asperger's are all conditions that show abnormalities in the empathy circuit and he looks at how people could develop these. There is a good amount of interesting information, like the differences between cognitive and affective empathy and the distinctions between the different disorders. The author also presents some original research where his team identified 4 genes associated with empathy. The thing I was disappointed in was how incomplete the book seemed. It doesn't come to many conclusions about committing cruel acts. After the build up of presenting the science of empathy, the author jumps around topics a bit, poses a few (thought provoking) questions and gives his opinions (which I enjoyed). The author states, ""if I have successfully moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution."" I think the author made an important discovery in the genetics of empathy and he wanted to present his research, as well prompt others to begin investigation. It is not claiming to be a resolved topic. While that may be frustrating as a reader, I think the book did its job."
117,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,3,"This book is talked about by many of the other authors I have read, so I thought I should check it out.Author Simon Baron-Cohen produces the thesis that empathy can be plotted on a Gaussian (or ""bell curve"") distribution, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and psychopaths and the extremely empathetic occupying the tail ends of the distribution. The book also talks about narcissism, autism, antisocial disorder, and borderline personality disorder.Cohen rejects the orthodox thinking that ""evil"" exists as a pathology, and proposes that it is instead a lack of empathy; Seeing a person (or group of people) not as human beings, but objects. While his thesis is interesting, I found this book to be one of those unfortunate science books that are plagued by dry, arduous and long-winded writing. It could have done better with a more rigorous editing and formatting, in my opinion. Also, Cohen states his concern about a societal erosion of empathy in a few places in the book. I would argue that empathy in modern, western countries is trending the other way; towards a pathology. Paul Bloom covers a bit of this in his 2016 book ""Against Empathy"".While I found this book somewhat interesting, it could have been improved by a more engaging writing style.3 stars. "
118,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23939713-daniel-gauss,2,"Instead of buying this book, here's all you need to know (it wasn't in the book): John Locke wrote a long time ago that when we see someone in pain, we also tend to feel pain. It's not the same pain, it's an emotional pain, and it causes us to stop the suffering or to avoid hurting people. This pain that we feel when we see or imagine pain plays a HUGE factor in our lives.It's an emotional response. This is, basically, what this author calls 'empathy' - the capacity to feel pain when we see pain. He doesn't say this because there's a lot of fuzzy, sentimental thinking in this book. There's a lot of filler material in this book.So 1) we tend to feel pain when we see pain. 2) When don't we feel pain when we see pain? This is the other thing you need to be able to think about. If the person suffering is not like you, you might not feel much pain when he/she suffers. If you can demonize the person, you might not feel pain when you see this type of person suffering.So basically the guy's argument is that we don't feel pain when we see people we don't like suffering, and this leads to the ability to engage in evil actions.There you go, now you can spend your hard-earned money on a better book."

He covers the basics of the malignant personality types (cluster B), the supposed anatomical pathways and chemical mechanisms for experiencing empathy, and the purported causes get summarized briefly. Unfortunately, it only devotes about two sentences to the impact beliefs (narratives) have on behavior, which is surprising, because cognitive behavioral therapy actually has a decent track record in producing positive outcomes. If you are like me and looking for research that attempts less to locate and assign empathy to prescriptions (Baron Cohen suggests that the nasal spray emitting oxytocin is a promising breakthrough) while relegating emotions to measurements within a rigid scientific paradigm, but rather you prefer a discussion of innovative methods to improve perspectives, self-worth, etc. by teaching/encouraging empathy, then I would suggest Lewis Mehl-Madrona's ""Healing the Mind through the Power of Story: The Promise of Narrative Psychiatry.""

120,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36603555-katherine-addison,2,"This is an okay book about how empathy works in the brain. Baron-Cohen is arguing that we should replace the idea of ""evil""---which explains nothing about human nature---with the idea of zero empathy. People with borderline, antisocial, and narcissistic personality disorders have what he calls zero-negative empathy, which includes intentional cruelty and has no redeeming characteristics, while people on the autism spectrum have what he calls zero-positive empathy: they don't understand other people's emotions, but have no intent to harm, and their lack of empathy is (often) paired with increased pattern-recognition ability. I'm dubious about this descriptive schema, mostly because I feel like the gap between the autism spectrum and personality disorders is wider than he's trying to make it out to be (I also think he gets a little starry-eyed at the end, when he's talking about teaching empathy to psychopaths), but I think he's right that ""zero empathy"" is a more useful explanatory tool than ""evil.""Three stars.ETA 2020/03/01 The more I think about it, the less I like Baron-Cohen's ideas.

I thought it would be more about how we view those who are evil and dissect varying meanings of evil. However, despite the book turning out to be an argument for why we should push the study of empathy, I was pleasantly surprised. Cohen uses many arguments for how empathy is developed and understood (environmental, genetic, etc) so I don't feel he is pushing a particular origin rather suggesting that empathy has a larger role in our lives than currently understood and that we need to continue to learn about it. I'd compare this book more so to a review on what we already know about some disorders and their relation to empathy and the development of new terminologies and frameworks could elucidate how we continue to think about those disorders and future ones. This book posits more ideas than concludes but I think if you're open minded to reading an opinion piece with substantial evidence to support it, it could be an interesting read."

After laying this groundwork, we basically get the author's body of scientific research laid out for us as he describes in detail the various types of people with ""zero degrees of empathy"": borderlines, narcissists, and psychopaths. I've been a bit negative here, but if anything the reason is because I was disappointed in the content. The author talks a lot about extreme empathy disorders, and there are some very good nuggets of knowledge here.

The author urges readers to challenge the traditional religious/spiritual explanation for acts of cruelty. Deduction that such acts are just unexplainable serves no purpose in decoding the mentality behind the behavior.During the span of his research the author discusses a couple routes to which an individual may arrive at a state of empathy depletion. The presence of a personality disorder or autistic spectrum condition are the abnormalities which mark the erosion. Individuals characterized as zero negative develop the state of empathy erosion through the manifestation of personality disorders. Although this does not categorize all of the personality disorders that may cause one to experience empathy erosion. Borderline, narcissistic, and psychopathic personality disorders are rooted in egocentricity making it extremely difficult to empathize.In the following manifestation of empathy erosion, the author discusses individuals with autistic conditions particularly Aspergers Syndrome. The low states of empathy are compounded by the need for the autistic mind to systematize. "
124,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18474377-hemen-kalita,2,"The book simplifies the world by making ""Lack of empathy"" as the root of all evil. The author underpins his argument on the dark triads - Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychopathy and Narcissism. He replaced Machiavellianism with BPD as he considers Machiavellianism as amateur Psychopathy! People with dark triad traits lack empathy and are mostly behind all the violence we see around the world. Author further adds that empathy can be learned and by effective rehabilitation program we can transform the criminals and can vastly reduce crimes and harsh punishments alike. These are outlandish claims. Additionally, The author doesn't mention about the positive effects of lacking empathy and negative effects of high empathy. Functional psychopaths are running the world by heading most of the NGOs as well as Private and Govt organizations. On the other hand, highly emphatic peoples are handicapped by pathological altruism. He completely ignored these facts, that's why I don't by his black and white world of Empathy."
125,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735537-pauline-plissner,3," It was good to read about what happens in the brain and that empathy or the lack of it shows up in at least ten regions of the brain. A good insightful read. This is a quote from the book--"" But I should qualify the definition of empathy by adding that the point at which we objectify another person while simultaneously switching off our sensitivity to his emotions is the starting point toward zero degrees of empathy. It is not the end point because as we have seen in the catalog of crimes people commit, such a state of mind simply makes it possible to behave in more and more hurtful ways."" This is a critical point because in society we see leanings toward dehumanization in the way we respond to others. I found myself asking, "" In what ways do I objectify people?"" As Martin Luther King said, "" Hate cannot cast out hate. Only love can do that."" Doesn't mean it always will or that there is never a time to stop evil with solid boundaries, but that it should be done in love. "

I found this book surprisingly entertaining and not too technical, so I enjoyed it for the most part. However, I could have done without the author's naive political insights in the end. For example, he presents the Israeli-Palestinian ""conflict"" as an example which could be remedied ""if only each community could see the other's point of view and empathize."" You cannot call on both sides to have empathy for each other when one is actively oppressing the other. ""Whatever the cause, the consequence has been 60 years....of human suffering"" on both sides. When one of the two parties is occupied and dispossessed by the other, the cause is of utmost importance. He ends with ""empathy cannot by definition oppress anyone."" Actually, it can. Misplaced empathy can itself be a form of, or result in, oppression. "
127,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2655013-sandeep-gautam,3,"In this book, Simon Baron-Cohen makes an argument that evil is actually due to lack of empathy- an argument that I find hard to buy hook, line and sinker. Yet he does throw light on a lot of issue surrounding empathy, like the difference between cognitive and emotional empathy; the brain systems, environmental influences and genetic factors affecting empathy and his classification of zero negative and zero positive forms of empathy is interesting. I somehow still find it hard to club Narcissist, psychopaths and borderline as all having zero negative empathy deficit; his theory about Aspergers having zero positive empathy viz systematizing is more plausible and something that has stood the test of time. The writing flows easily and naturally and its a relatively short book, but with bulky notes and appendices. Overall worth reading and contemplating. "

Whether or not you agree with the author is beside the point and it shouldn’t affect its rating.The author starts by giving some examples what low or no empathy looks like. He proceeds to describe each profile and gives real life examples and, whenever possible I assume, an extra example of a known personality (as in famous person ahah). Hoje next chapter becomes more scientific, but no less interesting, with an explanation which areas of the brain are affected or not “switched on”.Don’t be put off by some of the reviews.. make up your own mind and read it.

It does well to bring in the very sciency and technical parts quite gradually and even if you haven't taken all of that it in early chapters (which I didn't) it didn't matter too much while continuing through the book as it discusses other points e.g. personality types like psychopathy and narcissism, with portraits of people. It's surprisingly an easy and refreshing read. I also like that as a science book the author doesn't shy away from revealing parts of his personality or opinions on matters, particularly some of the morals and ethics of past research. It's short enough and enlightening enough that I would be hapy to re-read one afternoon."
130,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,2,"If I had to sum this book up in a short sentence, it would be 'Strong on science, weak on Philosophy'. The book starts out badly by asserting that 'religion', presumably in this case the Judaeo-Christian tradition, holds that evil is a brute fact which is not capable of explanation. This simply isn't the case, and the fact that Baron-Cohen thinks this shows that he has spent literally no time at all investigating the matter; St Augustine's discussion of evil, just to pick an example, actually mirrors his own outlines of the 'zero-negative' types in many respects. Those discussions of evil which define evil as a brute and inexplicable malevolence are in fact discussions of a hypothetical 'pure evil' in which evil is unmixed with other normal emotions and motivations; in which a person would simply want to do things because they were bad, rather than out of a mistaken apprehension of the good. This idea follows from Aristotle's notion that people always aim to do what they think is good, but that evil people are often mistaken. Theologians are divided over whether such a category of evil even exists, so it certainly should not be seen as the main theological account of evil.The discussion of clinical evidence in the book is interesting, but unfortunately the persuasiveness of the whole work is continually undermined by these failures to do basic research, or by sheer philosophical naivety. Towards the end of the book, where Baron-Cohen is arguing for greater leniency towards certain kinds of criminals, and that the Israel Palestine conflict can be solved by a process of empathy, what he ignores is that justice is a separate analytical category from empathy. An Israeli empathising with Palestinians is not going to force them to conclude that the real rulers of the Israeli state ought to be Palestinians, or vice versa, but unfortunately, in cases such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, for many people involved, such a counter-factual situation is the only one which approximates justice. Empathy for someone's emotional state does not guarantee that you will agree with their assessment of the situation or the claims they make about their situation.Similarly, his argument that, even if certain offenders have diminished responsibility for their actions due to deficiencies in their neurological equipment for empathy, they still ought to be sentenced to lengthy jail-terms in order to protect the public and convey society's disapproval of their act ignores the central question of whether or not justice has been done, and pretends that justice can be boiled down to considerations of expediency.Furthermore, in several places he asserts that in order to commit certain kinds violent of acts, at that time, the person in question must be suffering a temporary empathy deficiency. This is just unpersuasive, demonstrating as it does very little awareness of the potential for internal conflict that characterises human life; surely we know that sometimes people do terrible things with their empathy intact, precisely because they feel that there is some more important principle at stake.As in many works of pop-science, it is when the philosophical conclusions are being drawn that the narrative falls apart. Baron-Cohen seems doubtful, for example, about the existence of free-will, but nevertheless thinks we should keep it part of our conceptual vocabulary because it is a useful regulatory concept. He does not even address the many issues that such a stance raises, such as what use a fiction can have in informing justice; surely if we don't really have free will, no one is responsible for anything, and in fact, it doesn't matter whether our punishments are harsh or lenient; we are all simply following the inevitable chain of events. Free will isn't just a matter of choice, it is a concept upon which ideas like 'meaning', 'fairness', 'responsibility', and 'justice' depend. It can't simply be kept around if it isn't true, or more accurately, it makes no moral difference whether we keep it around or not; we are not responsible for our actions.It's books like this that make you wish scientists would just stick to the science."

Baron-Cohen writes well and his main points in The Science of Evil are these:One, we should not settle with the term 'evil'. Question it! Hitler was evil - sure thing. But don't stop there - what does this mean? Was little Adolf born with the evil gene and hence condemned to a life bringing nothing but death to the world? Baron-Cohen doesn't give a simple answer, but encourages us to think. And two, empathy is one of the most valuable human resources. Put beautifully in the very final words on the last page:""I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And unlike the arms industry, which costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison industry and legal system, which cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And unlike religion, empathy cannot by definition oppress anyone.""Finally, the book gets a few bonus points for including a fun Empathy Quotient (EQ) test in Appendix 1."

I do agree with this argument, but I do not think that the book managed to achieve its goal. I found it a bit reductionist and lacking, overall. But I will give it points for trying to put forward a very good point and for having noble intentions at heart. Also, because it gave me the concept of empathy erosion as a replacement for 'evil'. "

There was unfortunately no mention of how many gaps the EQ leaves, and that it is actually a broken measure for empathy, even if it is the only one that exists. I was very confused on his views of psycopaths, and while he made some weak nature versus nuture arguments, nothing seemed to add up to an argument about why a lack of empathy turns into the grand scales of violence. He mentions treating humans as objects, but rarely correlates the examples with sociological factors (I kept reminding myself he's a psychologist, but it seems his understanding of his own research was weak at best).I was lost when he delved into the pathos arguments about autism and how autistic individuals can be awesome. How does this have to do with evil? He spent more time on borderline personality disorder and autism than he did on actually arguing that the lack of empathy directly correlates to violence (but sorry, he actually says it doesn't, so I'm really lost as to why he wrote this book to make an argument only then to undermine it himself).In the very last section, he finally starts trying to make a point. By then, he throws in that empathy is the most important thing we have, and that we need to have a DSM category for empathy erosion disorders. I might have been more convinced if the argument wasn't fully based in pathos and anecdotes. I get it, people with autism get a bad reputation and it's not their fault, but you can't convince me that someone who rapes a woman because he doesn't know better, and would likely do it again because he thinks he did no wrong, is someone we can have walking free in society.nI also thought his understanding of the criminal justice system was poor, as he is using a micro lens of view instead of the meso or even macro levels of how it operates. The temporary lack of empathy doesn't mean a woman should be let down easier for killing her children. She knew what she was doing and, while obviously a horrible act for stupid reasons, she carried it out with efficiency.Overall I was very disappointed in this book. He had poor editing (jumped from using he to she/he to they in one sentence) and needed to sit down and come up with a more precise argument. He kept referencing horrible acts but then failed to show me how, in the research cited, it actually meant anything. I also feel he doesn't understand psychopaths as well as he thinks, because while they are more inclined to commit crimes, they simply lack any empathy at all. They usually realize at a young age they don't feel the same emotions or empathize with others, and that isn't something they will learn. There are psychopaths who just end up using people but don't commit crimes, though it's not as broadly discussed.ETA: I'm also not a fan of how he cherry picked research and then failed to give me actual numbers on the research groups used to prove a point. Telling me Denmark did a study on boys and 4% that almost died at birth committed 18% of the crime means absolutely nothing to me. Was it a study of 50 boys? An entire generation? The country? His explanations for the empathy circuit were pretty void of detail as well, just telling me that they showed less activity in xyz parts of the brain at certain times. Less than what? How did they normalize the measurement? Or is he saying the activity decreased when seeing the images or situations? He should know better than blindly citing sources, as he is a researcher himself. I'm not sure if he ""dumbed"" it down for the masses or if he felt people would just absorb the numbers blindly.Honestly the best thing that came out of this book was discovering that someone used Phillip Zimbardos prison experiment to write a book, Ordinary Men, which I will follow up with for hopefully better reading. For those who don't know, it was an experiment where college students were brought into a mock prison setting and divided into prisoners and guards. The extreme changes in behavior happened so fast that full blown riots were breaking out within the first two weeks. Zimbardo and his team had to shut the experiment down because it got out of hand so fast. Now why was this mentioned so quickly and not used in an argument about empathy and cruelty? I have no clue. Assuming we're not throwing it out the window due to some questionable ethics and claims Zimbardo became more involved than necessary, it would make for a more sound platform of debate on how quickly those given the feeling of power dominate, objectify, and then victimize others. Especially since, before the experiment, they were normal functioning students."

It took me a few minutes to realize this was that Simon Baron-Cohen, major contributor to the science of autism. His previous books, The Essential Difference and Mindblindness, wouldn’t appear to prepare his audience for a topic this grim. But they do, in fact, lay vital groundwork. Baron-Cohen has been working towards this book his whole life. I do see the tile as a headline, written for attention, because while the author acknowledges evil, he prefers the “cruelty” they’ve kept to the small print. His word choice is deliberate; we might hesitate to call ourselves evil, but we know ourselves well equip to be cruel. And it is quickly apparent that while he’ll talk about the extremes, the narcissists and borderliners and hyped psychopaths, his real concern is how everyday people lose empathy, because it is everyday people who have written human history. Describing a childhood of stories, human beings beings turned into lampshades, the neighbour who’d had her hands reattached backwards by Nazi scientists, there’s a cry of horror, yes, but his response was to begin to search empathy’s parameters. Most of the book is spent exploring the empathy scale his research group assembled, with human examples and discussion along the way. The first stop, our monsters, the zero-negatives, people capable of recognizing another’s emotion, but unable to emotionally connect with it. I appreciated Baron-Cohen's compassion for those we call outright evil, his recognition of their loneliness and frustration, as they are left on the outside, and must fill their lives with things that human beings are not built to thrive upon. Empathy is not a cuddly hippy feeling, but a mechanism for survival. The zero-negatives are briefly contrasted with the zero-positives on the autistic spectrum, those who may not be able to recognize emotion, but tend to possess deep affective empathy. He illustrated how, when autistics know someone is hurting, they connect closely and respond with compassion. One priority here, to make it obvious the autistic among us are, if anything, less likely to harm others, took on weight in the wake of the Sandy-Hook tragedy, and the resulting media squawk around mental illness that took an ugly turn against reason. From those who have not, we take a look at the majority who have. And we’re not too pretty in our possession. We let it go, lose it, are damn careless about the whole thing. Baron-Cohen contends that there's a reason empathy fluctuates, because to be locked in the empathetic extreme, feeling what others feel all day, we would be unable to function, complete tasks, or discover our own thoughts and feelings. He rotates the concept of healthy empathy, whether anyone can, in fact, be healthy and be at ten on the scale, possess “Super-Empathy”. He wraps science around a remarkable monk with seemingly limitless cognitive empathy, and a moving account of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, an example of his own ideal. And then we come to our darkness, the things that we do because we are only following orders, are walking through our everyday with blinders, are lost in depression and fury, are not paying attention to the human at the other end of our fingertips. Beyond the specificity of his research, what made this book different from other texts on the subject was the author. Baron-Cohen is a story-teller in the best human tradition, and I appreciated the conversation he opened as he went. He acknowledges the limitations of his science, and our ability to actually understand how another person feels, how they act outside the lab and observation. But what struck me most didn’t come till the close. He explains that empathy is a resource, one that we, our governments, communities, and parents, have assumed will be there when required, but historically have never understood. He underlines that empathy is teachable, there are signs and remedies when it erodes, and we must begin cultivating it. He argues for this being the most cost effective solution to social issues, personal, national, international, beyond being the most humane and balanced. Two fathers stand up in a synagogue. Each shares how his son was killed by their people's ancient enemies. The Palestinian wishes everyone Shabbat Shalom. The Israeli bids them Saleem Aleikem. They met through a phone line set up to allow bereavement calls across the barbed wire, and now they travel to mosques and synagogues around the world, speaking, “Your pain is my pain,” this suffering must end. Empathy as our most valuable resource. A concept long past due.A version of this review also appears at http://boxesofpaper.com/2013/02/12/du..."

195,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7855901-ryan,3,"These are always hard reviews to write. Why? I am not anywhere as close to as educated or intelligent as these people. I do my best, but I believe I really just suck up the outline and carry on.  The author just so happens to be a professor of Developmental Psychopathology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. As well as the Director of the University's Autism Research Centre, as if he wasn’t busy enough with the other engagements. On top of those achievements he also has a host of rather famous family members. Simon has a son who is an independent film maker and a daughter who is a song writer. Also, two brothers who are award winning film directors. His cousins are a famous computer scientist, a composer, film producer, playwright, University of Washington professor, and of course the famous comedic actor Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat.) Simon also has over thirteen independent book authoring's in the field of psychiatry. Impressive really.  In any event, in this short book, The Science of Evil, Simon attempts to root out what in the human condition or physiology causes evil. He starts by taking a very broad generalization of the Nazi experiments on Jews during World War 2 and then attempts to explain it as a series of empathy failures cause by dysfunctional parts of the brain. As the book progresses, Simon gives you more information about which parts of the brain make up what he calls the 'Empathy Circuit' and gives real world clinical examples of people that suffer some shortage on the empathy scale which can be directly attributed to reduced or no activity in these portions of the brain. The clinical studies are interesting; actually the whole book is interesting but starts to drag at the end. The last heading particularly feels like more of a rant or diatribe than any sort of case study. Simon, at the wrap, states that he feels that the current DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is currently wrong, more to the point that it needs to be revised. According to Simon, nearly every mental disorder can relate back to a failure in empathy and that this is in fact the one unifying thing about mental disorders. If we could, for instance, re-categorize anorexia using the empathy classifiers (as anorexia patients display many of the same signs of other mental illnesses when using the empathy grouping system) would actually do a lot of good for the patient (hearing disorder in relation to their sickness only embellishing the issue and does not help to solve it, whereas hearing that it might simply be a lack of activity in a certain portion of the brain removes the blame and hurt associated with the illness.) He starts to lose me in the diatribe at the end. Not that I can dismiss the arguments, but simply that I do not necessarily agree with some of his conclusions. For instance, while Simon is vehemently against the death penalty for anyone showing a lack of empathy in a killing (because they were in essence experiencing brain malfunction), I openly welcome it. Furthermore, when he goes to explain and tie together the conclusion about how the Nazi's could systematically (nearly) wipe an entire sect of people without a single empathetic person in the process I think he fails.  Basically he breaks it down to:Person 1: My job was to arrest the people on the list. That's all.Person 2: My job was to ensure that these people got on a train. That's all.Person 3: My job was to ensure that the people got off the train and through the door. That's all.Person 4: My job was to ensure that the people got into the room. That's all.Person 5: My job was to ensure that I pulled the lever once the people where in the room. That's all.Person 6: My job was to move and dispose of the recently deceased. That's all. This seems shallow and I can't condone the thought that these people didn't know what was going on. I think Simon's epithetical argument makes sense on a one off 'mental disorder' situation but not in a culture wide setting. It just felt like a cop-out to me. He also postulates that a lack of empathy is the reason the world is going to shit, and if only we could all possess more empathy the world would magically fix itself. I personally find the notion romantic and whimsical, but exactly that. Overall, I would suggest Jon Ronson's 'The Psychopath Test' before this and if they enjoyed that, would I than shoot them to this book. Perhaps that’s simply personal choice as a reader."

197,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008448-evalangui,2,"I expected more... This book's focus is extremely narrow (basically lack of empathy, momentary or systematic, is the cause of evil acts) and Baron-Cohen seems to relish retelling gruesome tales that do not make any kind of point. Furthermore, he asks questions and poses theories and then doesn't follow through.I have the feeling I missed something... First he described empathy as a two part process: notice what the other person feels & react sympathetically. But he never again separates them. Then he proposes that there's 3 main types of negative lack of empathy (0 empathy): N(arcisist), P(sicopath/antisocial) and B(orderline), but argues that autism is a positive type (not sure how since he never manages to link the systematizing talent to the lack of empathy and classic autism (the fact that an advanced systematizing ability shows up concurrently in a number of cases of extreme Aspergers doesn't mean they're related. Systematizing, great as it is, also cannot make ASD spectrum conditions wholly positive while all the other conditions are wholly negative (Psychopaths make great surgeons, according to him, for one thing, and they also make great soldiers --if it was wholly negative, nature wouldn't have allowed it to survive to the degree it has, for one)Being autistic myself, I actually have to argue against the idea that autistic people in general underreact to painful emotional stimuli (ie. seeing another person suffer in an obvious manner such as getting their hand prickled with a needle). A lot of autistics are actually the opposite, overreactive (the sole mention of something physically painful makes me flinch, nevermind seeing it and to give a famous example, think of Temple Grandin's sympathizing with the cattle's distress and designing a new model to help them). What happens instead, in my case, is that when I can prepare for pain (ie. blood test), I make an effort to concentrate on something interesting (the way the blood is drawn by using the vacuum is quite ingenious) and can split myself from my own body momentarily, feeling the pain less. The ability to systematize/be analytical can appear unfeeling, sure, but I'd hope a neurologist to be able to look past the obvious.Furthermore, he speaks of a spectrum of empathy (or empathy quotient) and of an autistic spectrum, then surely there's a psychopathic and Borderline spectrum, too? Not that he even bothers to acknowledge the autistic spectrum, even as he mentions, he goes back to the old-fashioned Asperger vs Classic Autism division and concludes everybody on the spectrum has super systematizing and 0 empathy (which he calls 'positive' because autistics don't intentionally try to harm others, simply don't realise they're doing so. From his own descriptions, the same seems often true of those suffering from Borderline and Narcissism, since they're so lost in their own emotions, there's no room left for anybody else's, but somehow those two get classified as 'negative', no scientific explanation as to why since all of these conditions can lead to serious problems and there's BPD sufferers who manage to live productive lives just as there are autistics who do. In any case, even if the judgment is correct, there is no repeatable verifiable evidence to call them positive and negative instead of types with different advantages and disadvantages.I'm currently reading an Oliver Sacks book, in Italian --in which I'm moderately fluent, but in which I'm still finding one word a page I've no clue what it means-- and since both these books are about neurology, it's quite an amazing contrast of writing ability... I'm grateful this was an audiobook and even so I found it extremely repetitive. For starters, all the random acronyms for parts of the brain are super confusing and when he started listing the names of genes I wanted to shoot him (it's one thing to include them in the appendix or to mention one, but he made a list of several when the text is geared towards laypeople to whom it's clearly gonna be meaningless).Learned a couple things, sure, but it's severely dated, but the writing voice just didn't impress me at all. Won't repeat. "

200,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42384630-sana-burton,3,"(Content warnings: ableism; discussions of murder, war, and the holocaust.)This is a tough book to review, because some parts of it were good and other parts of it left me kind of squinting at the book and saying ""but is it though?""I enjoyed the notion of empathy being a spectrum, as opposed to a trait you either have or do not have, and which can be turned off or enhanced by situational factors, as well as the discussion of which brain regions are involved in emotion recognition and regulation, and the idea that empathy can be taught.My issue with this book, and with Baron-Cohen's work in general, is largely with his specific types of ""zero empathy"", in particular with his explanation of autistic people, or what Baron-Cohen calls Zero Positive. Positive because the systemizing abilities of these individuals have allowed them to contribute to human knowledge and culture - and this is where that ""but is it though?"" response comes in, because I have known many, many autistic people who do not resonate with the empathising-systemising model, for example who describe themselves as having ""nornal"" affective but impaired cognitive empathy, as struggling with executive function or information processing to a point where effective systemising becomes difficult (don't forget that autism and ADHD are comorbid!), or as primarily having a neurotype that affects sensory processing, with the social deficits being a side effect of that, rather than the other way around.Granted, there may be different ""types"" of what we currently know as autism, and Baron-Cohen does acknowledge this in passing, as well as that some genetic factors that influence autistic traits do not have an effect on empathy, but it is interesting to note that all of the examples he uses for autism are male, and with some degree of savant skill, as this does not represent the entire autistic population and, crucially, is the demographic most likely to fit the ""zero positive, high systemizing"" view of autism that he is arguing for, with nonverbal autistics, autistic women, autistic POC, LGBT autistics, and those diagnosed in adulthood being likely to report less typical experiences. Another ""but is it, though?"" moment comes in his categorization of BPD as ""zero negative"" alongside ASPD. But are borderlines really suffering from an innate lack of empathy as a core feature, or is it just that the emotional turmoil of being borderline makes it hard to have the mental space for it, and they may be highly empathetic when they actually feel safe. He also writes off the possibility that hyperempathy (or ""super-empathy"", in his words) could have negative aspects as something ""some people"" have suggested to him, and presents some wildly inaccurate speculation on what stimming is, which he admits is an assumption, despite the fact that accounts of what stimming actually is and why autistic (and other neurodivergent) people stim aren't exactly hard to come by.Basically, when Baron-Cohen is talking about the general population, situational empathy erosion, or brain structure, he is very eloquent and insightful. When talking about mentally Ill, disabled, or neurodivergent people, he comes across as arrogant, ableist, and unwilling to take into account lived experience that doesn't fit his views. (I also would have liked more discussion of how empathy erosion happens and the effects of ideology and the systematic dehumanization of certain groups - selective empathy so to speak - instead of it being an afterthought, but I guess that's a topic for a different book.)"
201,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727637-tiffaney,3,"Having previously listened to a radio interview with Simon Baron-Cohen on NPR, I was very interested in reading more about Cohen's reexamination of the criteria that we are using (via the DSM V) to assess personality disorders. The disorders specifically covered within this text hone in on those in which there is an absence of or low degrees of empathy: Antisocial PD, Narcissism, Asperger's Syndrome, Borderline PD, and Autism. Cohen takes the time to explain the different regions within the brain that are responsible for our ability to feel empathy. He goes on to further discuss how the personality disorders listed differ on their degrees of empathy.Cohen's primary suggestion is that mental health professionals begin their assessments by examining the levels of empathy from a patient above all other criteria. While I feel it is completely accurate to state that the majority of these disorders (where an absence of empathy is present) are a combination of both genetics (nature) and environment (nurture), Cohen suggests that we can treat the majority of these disorders by simply expressing more kindness...What I see the mental health community assume so often is that the largest majority of people with disorders like Borderline PD, Narcissism, and Antisocial PD, proactively seek out help. It seems overly simplistic to assume that demonstrating empathy toward an adult with a disorder like any of the 3 listed above, is going to help that adult in any way. Firstly, you would need to rule out that this adult possesses the ability to feel anything at all. A seized opportunity to express empathy with a ""child"" who is demonstrating ""empathy absent"" behavior is one thing but, keeping in mind that most behavior becomes increasingly salient with time, I feel that Cohen's suggestion is very shallow. An individual whose main objective is manipulating those around him to get what he wants, certainly isn't going to seek out professional help as this would defeat his whole purpose.Cohen suggests that by exposing an ""empathy absent"" person to long and continual empathy, he will develop this absent trait. If the empathy absent person does not possess the ability to feel (other than perhaps, his own sense of pain and reward), I feel that it is highly unlikely for emotions to begin to kick in. Many people who possess the traits found in the Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Borderline personality disorders ""do"" understand the emotions of others and will often use these emotions to take advantage of any given situation. This affects the reward pathways in these individuals and thus, makes sense for them to manipulate the feelings of others to gain the best rewards for themselves.So, does kindness really matter? Of course it does! I feel however, that the only way expressing kindness can really make a difference within those who are lacking empathy, is to pay the closest amount of attention to our youth. Young people with conduct disorder and adolescents who demonstrate manipulation of those around them for personal gain are possibly the best attempt for success with ""Empathy Exposure"" however, this is still not a guarantee for success. Just because we feel varying degrees of empathy toward those around us does not mean that the person next to you feels anything at all,...or ever will."
202,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11318000-jess-miller,2,"At first, I really wanted to give this book a chance. I will fully admit the title caught my attention as I love studying anything even slightly related to abnormal/criminal psychology. But I'm pretty disappointed in this author for a few reasons:1. His sentence structure is awful. He constantly uses simplistic form (i.e., ""Jackie is 9 years old. She has a cat. Sometimes the cat makes her mad."") and is incredibly redundant. I cannot stress how much fluff there is in this book; it reminds me of the times I had been assigned a topic I wasn't interested in during 8th grade, but had to meet a goal amount of words, so I'd just paraphrase what I said over and over. 2. He's convinced there isn't a cure for Type P, B, and N personalities (Psychopath, Borderline, & Narcissist). I'm pretty sure this man has either never heard of psychotherapy or doesn't believe in its effectiveness. As an individual with Borderline Personality Disorder, I can definitely attest that it does help significantly. Although I'm not aware of the statistics in its aid with those diagnosed as Psycho/Sociopaths or Narcissists, I'm aware that it is a common form of treatment considered for them as well. 3. Now, I know I went into this knowing the title, but he insists that the aforementioned Types do not constitute evil - yet, he is CONSTANTLY reassuring the reader of it. Okay... we get it. They're not evil, even though you group them in the Zero-Negative side of empathy, while placing individuals with autistic disorders such as Asperger's on the Zero-Positive side. And if you haven't read this book, you can definitely infer what he claims by the negative/positive parts of empathy: bad and good. 4. He often begins statements with something along the lines of, ""In my view..."" This irks me immensely because he's making claims yet throwing his damn opinion in when he can't fill the blank or answer his own question. Your view means nothing if you've no testable hypothesis or theory, nor data, to back up what you ""believe."" Especially in psychology. Overall, I wouldn't pick up another book (if there are any) written by this man. I'm sure he meant well and there are good parts of the book that are, from what I've learned from therapists and doctors along with my own studies (yep, Psych major here), factual for now in the world of psychology. However, there's so much bias toward condemning his Types that I can't stomach much more of it. Honestly, it's not really offensive, but several of his claims have been broken repeatedly by case studies where individuals with these personality disorders have either overcome or gained new perspective in which they're able to manage them. I just think it adds to the ignorance of those who lack empathy due to mental illness. Even if we can get hurt by these people, and whether or not they're murderers or manipulators, they're still human and if we want to end unnecessary woe caused by them, we should be able to offer up the same amount of empathy this author claims they should have to be a whole human. "
203,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7476559-owen,4,"This is a good read on the nature of empathy and how the lack of empathy manifests itself in different ways. It presents a lot of good facts and various perspectives on how empathy or the lack therof operates. I found his breaking down the lack of empathy in narcissism, psychopath, and borderline personality (Type-N, Type-P, and Type-B, respectively) to be extremely information and helpful way to classify 'evil.' Furthermore, his explanation that empathy sometimes temporarily fades is helpful with dealing with more real world situations (as behavior is combined not just by traits, but by situations that may lead to the suppression of otherwise dominant traits, such as empathy in some people). Finally, Baron-Cohen draws on a great observation on the extreme Systematizing tendencies of people with autism, and explaining how that inhibits empathy, but for positive purposes.However, one major point of critique: The author places an extreme emphasis on empathy as a solution to the problems. In the end, he suggests it so much so that super-empathy would be a beneficial response.However, I would suggest that empathy is only part of the solution; empathy is a response to attempts to response and help those who are hurting or to prevent from hurting someone else. AS such, it is always seeking to reach towards an ideal of the other being in a happy, well-functioning state. However, the the nature of reality as such is that we can not always help, and sometimes we must pick winners and losers. For instance, if we witness a potential murder in progress, it would be counterproductive to empathize with the aggressor; to do so would prevent protecting the victim. There is a winner and a loser; and empathy inappropriately place allows the aggressor to be the 'winner.'This is the sort of drama that plays out in the legal world (although with actually committed crimes), where rules have a greater prominence that just empathy. It is the rules about how to determine an oppressor and a victim that regulates empathic feelings towards persons, as sort of a 'codified' expression of cultural sympathies and empathies that tells individuals who to empathize with (a fusion of justice and empathy, two initially divergent strands in Western theorizing on morality). Unlimited empathy constantly runs up against the reality of a limited good. However, Baron-Cohen argues fora different direction with showing greater empathy towards perpetrators and against the death penalty. Perhaps Baron-Cohen is correct in that regards, but seems to show an unbridled expectations on the value of empathy.All-in-all a very good read and very scientific (although, the theory as presented is oversimplified). However, keep in mind his expectations on the value of increasing empathy is not as scientific."
204,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862728-james-perkins,2,"This was a rather disappointing book about the psychology of ""evil"", or as the author re-defines it, ""lack of empathy"". In changing the label, he is trying to remove the religious connotations that surround human cruelty and talk about it in a more scientific way. This is a good start. He discusses how parental affection for children actually alters the physical structure of the brain, and changes the areas that seem to be most active when both children and adults express empathy. So his thesis continues well. He has some good case studies to illustrate various personality types. Unfortunately, after this, this slim volume (186 pages of text before appendices and references) tries too hard and doesn't really deliver the goods. When talking about his subject, the author too often uses mechanical terms like ""empathy circuit"" as if the people he is talking about are computers rather than human. He fobs off the most important parts of empathy onto the physical brain and genetics; clearly this is important, but while he acknowledges the effects of environment on the individual, fails to remind us the that brain structures change over the course of the entire human life, and decides quite early on that those with underdeveloped ""empathy circuits"" will never gain the ability to fully express empathy like ""normal"" people - but then goes on to say that people who have been imprisoned after heinous crimes should be released and given a chance to demonstrate what little empathy they have, while forgetting that, according to his argument, their lack of empathy and underdeveloped brains are what caused their crimes in the first place. He seems to be contradicting himself.He pays lip service to the idea that the experience of a lot of cruelty can harden people so they appear to lack empathy, but does not offer a solution on how to restore it. or even that it might be possible. He keeps referring to the Nazis of the Second World War as if they are the only bad guys in history, and neglects both worse and more modern instances of human cruelty, referring to them only vaguely in passing, if at all. He also fails to acknowledge wider systems that openly encourage a lack of empathy in the socializing of people in society at large, and why people who could easily show kindness and understanding tend to conform to unempathic systems rather than resist them. At the end, he becomes warm and fuzzy and recommends empathy as a panacaea, but no practical way in which to harness it - a very unscientific ending to what is supposed to be a scientific book.I would expect much more from a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge. Stanford professor Philip Zimbardo explains the same thing much better and openly admits that we all have the capacity for evil - given the right circumstances, ordinary people like you or me can also be very, very nasty."

207,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7769627-justin,3,"I thought this was an effective and readable examination of the neuroscience and psychology behind human cruelty and ""evil."" He essentially tries to put some science behind explaining why some people seem to be ""evil"", which, as he points out, is an unhelpful explanation and subject to too little scientific study. It's interesting to consider that there's a broad resistance or reluctance to explain ""evil"". He argues that people who are described as evil have ""zero degrees"" of empathy, or more specifically they are ""zero-negative."" There are three profiles that fall into this category: Type B (or Borderline), Type P (or Psychopathic), or Type N (or Narcissistic). He explains all these types and examines their development from both neurological and psychological perspectives. It is clear from his explanation that both genetics and upbringing are factors in their causes.I was surprised at how common these types are, and that they had survived through evolution - what was the benefit of them to the species? Some were perhaps more ""beneficial"" than others. Psychopaths recognise the feelings of others (and so have cognitive empathy), but don't care about them (and so lack affective empathy), which can make them cold killers, but they can also be very successful - say - as a business leader. I was reminded of American Psycho.The danger, perhaps, of identifying people who are prone to do evil is that it prompts the question of what to do about them. Lock them up to keep the public safe, or kill them Minority Report-style? Simon Baron-Cohen strongly advocates treatment, but it is clear to me that some might not agree with that.There is also a ""zero positive"" category of zero degrees of empathy: autism. Autistics also lack empathy, but it is positive rather than harmful, as they typically excel at systemizing or pattern recognition, which is extremely beneficial to society.However, at the end of the book he returns to a consideration of Eichmann and the wider idea of the banality of evil. Here his theory of ""evil"" becomes a bit muddied, as many people seem able to switch off their empathy without falling into the categories above, self-excusing the momentary lack of empathy through either collective responsibility, or through the idea of that they are acting for the greater good. He explains soldiers and terrorists by referencing the latter.This is a really worthwhile read for helping to understand why some people act the way they do, and the science is explained well for the layperson."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43227213-themythbookshelf,3," Baron-Cohen begins with a couple of grappling chapters on the concept of evil, calling for the more appropriate and less abstract phrase ""empathy erosion"". He admits that though we are all capable of being momentarily void of empathy, there are biological, environmental and societal factors that enables certain people to ""be more evil"" than others. The book argues that a lack of empathy is found in a broad range of personality disorders, ranging from borderline personality to autism, opening the reader's eyes to the positive aspects that a low level of empathy can bring. This appears to contradict his concluding arguments that empathy is what makes us humane, and is what could ultimately resolve the current conflicts occurring across the globe. I found this to be an overly simplified, and idealistic position to say the least, and that is what this book is at its core: an overly optimistic work that lacks the appropriate amount of scientific data and information to back its conclusions up. The writing was, in my opinion, redundant and lacking in quality as a result of the author's intent on being accessible to as many kinds of people as possible. For those who are interested in the subject of evil, the book does not deliver ground-breaking knowledge, and could even be a disappointment. The fact that Baron-Cohen enters the discussion of evil by merely breaking it down into psychological disorders was an ineffective and shallow approach. For example, an integral part of the discussion on ""evil"" is entirely dismissed: to what extent can the trait be learned by all who are part of a systematized evil? The book lacked examples of experiments which, in my opinion, could have enriched this short read (the bibliography took up a considerable number of pages). There were also far too many instances where I nervously cringed at the book's probing into sex differences in relation to biological traits such as aggression and empathy circuits. The author's frequent one-liners marking the differences between male and female brains was, I found, out of place because such a subject deserves large amounts of research and delicate exploration, which he clearly failed to provide. The book's strength most certainly lies in its clarity and humane, sensitive approach to psychiatry, though there is not much else that makes this book stand unique or memorable. "
209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I've been a real fan of previous books by Simon Baron-Cohen like The Essential Difference, so opening this was one was a pleasant prospect. What I found was a book that wasn't bad... but that could have been a lot better. I got the impression of a book that had been rushed out without a lot of work going into it.The thesis at the heart of the book - that one of the important 'circuits' of the brain is the one dealing with empathy, and that individuals sit on an empathy spectrum, with some residing at zero degrees of empathy - is an interesting one. Baron-Cohen introduces us to three key personality types he defines as 'zero-negative' including psychopaths, plus types that are 'zero-positive' like those with Asperger's.In a way both of these definitions are odd, in that his zero-negatives can actually have a lot of the kind of empathy that involves being able to read another person's emotional state, and his zero-negatives can have a lot of the kind of empathy involved in sympathising with someone else's suffering. But this is certainly interesting stuff.He also points out that empathy is important because arguably it is erosion of empathy that makes not only individuals do bad things, but states get into long term conflicts, like the situation in the Middle East.And that's great as far as it goes (though he offers no actual significant mechanisms for dealing with these empathy issues). But the whole thing does not read particularly well. The worst section is the one where Baron-Cohen describes the different areas of the brain that seem to be involved in the 'empathy circuit' (not by any means a single region) this is dull and an impenetrable list of acronyms with very little benefit to the reader. For the rest, there is a lack of feeling of context. We are given this assertion about empathy, and these people with zero empathy (except where they aren't) without any way to make use of this information.So, a disappointment. With a significant re-write, more context and more readability this would be the 'valuable' and 'significant' book the puffs on the back claim it to be, but as it stands it's not quite there. Or am I just lacking empathy?Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
210,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3970593-sue-t,2,"Headline - very interesting stuff, but a lot wasn't new enough for me. The major point is that people deemed ""evil"" (brutal killers, cold-blooded criminals, sociopathic manipulators, etc.) lack the capacity for empathy. Baron-Cohen (a very famous autism researcher and cousin of Ali G/Borat/Bruno!) puts forth data and theory on all the various contributors to that absence of empathy. It is a good conceptualization, in that he covers biological differences and early environment. The early environment theories are based in attachment, which is one of my favoite families of theories, so I didn't learn much new there. Baron-Cohen tries to coin some terminology to describe people on various positions on the Empathy Spectrum. He says people with Borderline, Antisocial (Psychopaths), and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (which he annoyingly calls Type B, P, and N) are ""Zero-Negative"" on the empathy scale, while people with Autism are ""Zero-Positive."" That whole labeling and comparison felt a bit forced. He formulates that the thing that makes people with Autism's ""Zero"" a ""Zero-Positive"" is that their brains are also strong at systematizing. That holds water to a small degree, but it is a reach for me to consider the trait of systematizing to be the differentiator between a person with Autism Disorders and a Sociopath.He does cite lots of interesting brain imaging research that points to the existence of ""empathy circuitry"" in various parts of the brain as well as the potential for ""empathy genes."" Fascinating stuff!! I also really ""got"" the distinction between the two components of empathy - the affective part and the cognitive part. The idea that different brain regions light up for those aspects is really cool. Overall -- There was some interesting research and some interesting conceptualizations. For people who are curious about the origins of Borderline, Narcissistic, and Psychopathic Personalities or who don't know about the importance of early attachment to the development of empathy, this book would be a lot more interesting.

212,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2780292-tadas-talaikis,3,"Don't know what to think, but probably ""evil"" in real time can't be explained just by hereditary and development (environment) factors. If it says that brain is still developing til' 25 years, and can develop necessary patterns to cur oneself from conduct disorder, then it omits the whole picture - you can't name (e.g. give exact titles, like this is emphatic, this is psycho, etc.) omitting dynamic real time measures which are probably depended on replicator economics.For example, mentioned cases when antisocials almost all were pretty virgin. From the economic perspective (someone doesn't get sex because is too ugly) is compensated by violence. Genes and developments probably can encourage this type of compensation, but the main cause is self-repairing society mechanism. E.g., top society eats too much, becomes lazy, then a bunch of antisocials shoot them down in The Russian revolution (any other revolution or event would suffice as well) and changes are made to the structure.What I mean? Society unconsciously creates its ""action forces"" for changes. And they are created because society believes (all beliefs are lies) in some positive economic return when there is none (at least for now). So, let's say we do all good, we make an utopia, no antisocials, everyone talks, no problems, no beatings, no rape, no kill. OK, according to zero sum game framework, how that will be compensated? People will become very weak and will die from next generation civilization diseases.Damn, wanted to incorporate only real time economic framework and it became we need psychopaths to make us better because we are so dumb lazy apes we can't move our finger when there is a real need.But in any case, this is highly underdeveloped field and just crazy hypotheses arising from this underdevelopment."
213,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47979973-a-w,5,"What makes human beings cruel? A big question attached to a little word, one Simon Baron-Cohen answers with aplomb in this brief but brilliant book.He suggests that instead of reverting to tired ideas about ‘evil’ we consider instead the possibility that those who commit the most unspeakable acts might have an empathy deficit. They lack the important though too often overlooked ability to put themselves in the shoes of someone else.He marshals a powerful argument linking progressive levels of lacking empathy personality disorders, narcissism and at the most extreme end of the spectrum psychopathy. In the process he draws on examples ranging from the Holocaust to countless ‘ordinary’ lives derailed by an inability to understand the feelings of others.In doing so he writes with compassion and clarity about people, some of whom might be tagged as monsters, showing them to be human, all too human.Baron-Cohen’s explanations are models of clarity, no mean feat when you consider that much writing about the brain and its operations tends to rapidly turn into a confusing alphabet soup of acronyms. This is something of a barrier to understanding to engaging with a subject that is fundamental to understanding who we are and why we behave the way we do.He also explores how lacking empathy might bring benefits, in areas such as mathematical reasoning and creativity. Although it is possible for brilliance to have its origins in dysfunction, the price paid by the individual is often painfully high.The message of this book is that explaining cruelty is more complex than just saying some people are born bad. They're born different certainly; but not all that much different from the rest of us.For its clarity, compassion and the sheer joy in sharing knowledge on display Zero Degrees of Empathy deserves to become a classic popular science text."
214,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847966-kylajaclyn,3,"Though at times a very technical and scientific read, this is nonetheless a very crucial book. I debated between giving it 2 1/2 - 3 stars, but I think it warrants the latter because of what Simon Baron-Cohen hopes to achieve through writing it. Though it is scientific (and, to be fair, that is in the name of the book), Baron-Cohen does an excellent job of breaking down exactly what it means to be empathetic. Having just read ""The Sociopath Next Door,"" I felt that this book makes a great companion piece if one is able to read them back to back. Baron-Cohen breaks down a lack of empathy into two categories : Zero-Negative and Zero-Positive. The first category contains Psychopaths, Borderlines, and Narcissists. I would disagree about Borderlines, if only because at one point I had most of the symptoms myself, and I'm the most empathetic person I know. I did not gain much from this part of the book since I had just read about psychopaths in TSND, and I've always known the symptoms/attitudes of those with Borderline and Narcissistic personalities. The next chapter, Zero-Positive, is a bit more intriguing. My brother has Asperger's, and while I also know those symptoms all too well, it was interesting to learn how empathy registers in his brain. I found a lot in this book that helps me understand the way my brother is. For that alone the book deserves three stars.Baron-Cohen goes above and beyond to use the facts of science to illustrate his main point, which is that empathy is an incalculably important resource. It may seem obvious, but we see every day how the world (and our own country) is becoming more and more corrupt. Get a quick grip on this book and learn how to develop empathy (if you are lacking in it, that is). "
215,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37565580-kate-vinkemulder,3,"Have you ever wondered how humans can be so evil? After listening to the news, after hearing about all the terrorism in the world and all the wicked things humans do to other humans, do you ever wonder “How can someone be so cruel? Don’t they have a heart or feelings?” The answers lie in this book. “The Science of Evil” is a well-written nonfiction book by Simon Baren-Cohen. It starts out with a question along the lines of “Why do people do evil things to other people?” It gives examples of human cruelty (some of which are hard to comprehend) in the beginning. As you read these examples, the author leaves little hints leading up to his theory. He claims that the word “evil” can also be described as “empathy erosion”. As I continued to read, I noticed the trend of empathy. The author claims (and I agree) that the reason some humans are unpleasant to others is because they lack empathy. Simon Baren-Cohen does a good job of keeping his opinions out of his reasoning and explanations. He tells the reader that there are levels of empathy (or lack of empathy), and people can have varying amounts of it. For example, a murderer would have an extremely lower empathy level than, let’s say, a bully at school would. However, what they have in common is that both lack empathy. Simon Baren-Cohen doesn’t just explain why people can be cruel, he also explains what is chemically occurring in their brain to make them act that way. He tells us (and shows us with diagrams of the human brain) how the size of certain parts of the brain affects a person’s empathy level. Although the book’s topic is not a happy one, I enjoyed reading “The Science of Evil”, as it answered my questions on how and why human treat others as they do. "
216,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5186380-mariya,2,"This book could have been a whole lot more, but it left me disappointed. What drew me to it - and made me excited about the first couple of chapters - was the premise that the word ""evil"" leads to oversimplification and deters us from approaching morally reprehensible (or at least questionable) behaviour in a constructive manner. I also looked forward to an in-depth discussion on the phenomenon of erosion of empathy, which I find to be particularly relevant to present-day reality.The neurological and genetic research was interesting, and as a layperson I really appreciated the introduction to the brain and to different methods of doing genetic research. Breaking down empathy to components was also an excellent idea. However, I found the ""case studies"" of subjects with borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, Aspergers, etc. to be little more than caricatures. Those who know me also know how passionate I am about stigmatizing personality disorders, in particular BPD. I feel that someone who doesn't know much about borderline or only has a vague idea of it from hearsay and Hollywood movies would be very temped to take Baron-Cohen's ""case study"" of the manipulative mother at face value. The gratuitous use of the word ""psychopath"" also irked me a great deal. There are so many interpretations of it in psychology and (pop) culture, that I find it almost meaningless. There is a good reason why neither the DSM, nor the ICD actually use this term.While I found the author's interpretation of the causing factors for in-born low empathy very nuanced (just what I would expect from a good scientist), I feel the point could probably have been made in a more succinct way. More should have been devoted on the implications for society."
217,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6829322-clark-hays,3,"Never judge a book by its titleAfter finishing The Science of Evil, I found it misnamed and a little underwhelming -- Musings on Empathy by a Scientist would more apt. The science felt light, which is odd because the author is clearly knowledgeable and credentialed, and the underlying arguments seemed fairly straightforward and commonsensical: too much or, notably, too little empathy can be bad. A variety of studies showed that parts of the brain light up — or, in some cases, don’t light up — when empathy is in the house and there was a discussion of the “empathy circuit,” an imaginary coil of activity that basically involves the entire brain. There was also some description of various neurologic conditions and a broad and somewhat arbitrary classification system for empathy capturing the bell curve of distribution that seems applicable to almost any topic. The writing was solid, but the presence of the author and his opinions ever present, so this felt like more of a long op-ed with a few data points, or an intro class lecture, rather than science writing. For someone of his stature to arrive at “the world would be better with more empathy in it,” made for a lackluster journey. I’m glad I read it, but I wish it had been twice as long and much deeper. To be fair, if I’d read this book before Cruelty: Human Evil and the Human Brain, I probably would have given it four stars, but I still would have suggested a title change."
218,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"The overly-sensationalist title … The Science of Evil belies a considerably more mundane summary of studies designed to measure an individual’s empathy. Empathy is, of course, the ability to share or recognize emotions experienced by another creature. The idea being that a lack of empathy is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition of a person whose behavior we’d characterize as evil (treating sentient beings as if they were objects). Lack of empathy is one of the traits exhibited by psychopaths, but other personality disorders are also marked by low levels of empathy including: borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, bi-polar disorder, insecure attachment disorder and others. Baron-Cohen describes the traits of each personality type in turn, using the behaviors of actual individuals to illustrate each problem. Simon Baron-Cohen a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at the University of Cambridge.Unfortunately I found the book to be pretty dry stuff (especially considering that Simon is the cousin of Sacha Baron-Cohen aka: Borat … isn’t a sense of humor hereditable?). Baron-Cohen studies autism, a disorder that is also characterized by a lack of empathy, so the subject is right in his wheelhouse. While the content is fine, I think Baron-Cohen misses the mark when it comes to gearing the material to match his target audience (a problem many scientists turned writers appear to suffer from). In this case, I’d say the book was a complete success if the goal was to produce a text book for sophomore psychology majors. Not so much if his intended audience was the general public. "
219,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51744737-a,3,"Summary: People only do 'evil' things because they lack empathy, and therefore view humans as objects. Lack of empathy (temporary or not) is a disorder. Clinical/scientific analysis of empathy and systemising circuits was a bit dull. Interesting parallels drawn between Zero-Negative (borderlines, psychopaths, narcissists) and Zero-Positive (autism & aspergers) disorders. New thought process when thinking about corporal punishment, see quote below (pg 119):“If we treat another person as essentially bad, we dehumanise him or her. If we take the view that every human being has some good in them, even if it is only 0.1 per cent of their make-up, then by focusing on their good part, we humanise them. By acknowledging and attending to and rewarding their good part, we allow it to grow, like a small flower in a desert.I found it a provocative idea because the implication of this attitude is that no one - however evil we paint them to be - should be treated as 100 per cent bad, or as beyond responding to a humane approach. The question is whether one can push this to a logical conclusion: if unambiguously ‘evil’ individuals (a candidate for this category might be Hitler) felt remorse for their crimes, and had been punished, would we try to focus on their good qualities, with a view to rehabilitating them? My own view is that we should do this - no matter how bad their crime. It is the only way we can establish that we are showing empathy to the perpetrator, not just repeating the crime of turning the perpetrator into an object, and thus dehumanising them. To do that renders us no better than the person we punish.”"
220,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10909889-pete-welter,3,"This book has been on my shelf a while, but events of January 2017 caused me to pick it up, My main goal was a more nuanced understanding of empathy and of the psychology of non-empathy. In this, the book succeeded. In looking at individual without empathy, the author splits them into two groups: Zero-Negative and Zero-Positive, the ""zero"" being a 0 on a 0 to 6 scale of level of empathy (most of us are 3s or 4s). Zero-Negative include the borderline, the psychopath, and (most timely) the narcissist. Zero-Positive includes those with autism or Asperger's, for whom lack of empathy is a fact of life, but is not destructive (and in many cases, can be constructive). The author leads us through examples and general discussions on each of these types, along with discussions of the role of environment and genetics in the development of empathy.Compared to other popular psychology books I have read, I thought there was a bit too much of the ""I think that..."" without evidence for my comfort, and some base assumptions about individual psychology that were taken without question. One example, if you are familiar with the ""trolley problem,"" is that because most people would not sacrifice one person to save five (because of empathy with the one), that to not feel that way is unempathetic. This seems to say that ""normal"" means that one succumbs to cognitive biases that are flawed but human. I'm more hopeful that we can learn to go beyond just taking our biases as-is. Overall though, a reasonable read on the topic."
221,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656867-painting,5,I am no scientist but I found this a very accessible book on the complex and interesting subject regarding what is a very key aspect of human personality. My feeling is that this author wants to reach anybody who is dismayed and confused about news reports on the rise of autism and what appears to be a frightening increase of anti social behavior. I really like how the author proposes the importance of empathy as a basis to further research and and clarify the current definitions of problem personalities. The author's explanation of how research into brain functioning areas/parts and DNA can be used to define patterns of what we call evil behavior is also interesting enough for me to look forward to reading more in depth reporting. There are some interesting evaluations given and guidelines for spotting problem behaviors which we all could be a bit mindful of in ourselves and others. There are many examples given for what we call evil and good behavior.I found the examples of animals sharing food and caring for each other good points toward understanding and putting focus on empathy as an important survival strategy. The only example that I disagreed strongly on was the example of an evaluation of a Buddhist monk's empathy level which sounded like a possible condemnation of meditation as a blunting of empathy. Over all I found the book a nice opening for discussion of subject sorely lacking in today's political climate.
222,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4586546-pippa,3,"I totally agree with the premise of this book, that 'evil' is an unhelpful term in many ways and that we need to think about brain conditions that affect the ability to empathise. Having said that, I found it a slightly disappointing read. Most things are said over and over again, in different ways... even in the same paragraph sometimes. There's not much meat in it. The first part of the book did provide a breakdown of different brain conditions that could make it impossible for a person to empathise, and there were occasional little gems all the way through that were interesting. I just felt it could all have been written in a couple of good magazine articles.I was interested by the quiz in the back, which allowed you to assess your own ability to empathise. Again I felt it was slightly crude. I came out with a really high score (which is apparently very unusual... so that explains a lot to me!) One of the three questions I did lose marks on was: 'I really enjoy caring for people'. I wanted to say, 'Not true. But I do want to heal people through my writing.' I can't actually see why wanting to heal people through writing is less important... and some people with similar levels of empathy, (but need for intellectual stimulation) might become doctors, and I am sure there are other ways to express your care for people which I haven't thought of. So yes... all rather crude, but certainly a step in the right direction, as the subject is so very important."
223,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209176-allison,4,"This was a good book. Unlike some others I've read recently where authors basically write a mishmash of their observations/case studies, chaptered by subject, this book had a unifying theme/thesis. Simon Baron-Cohen had a goal of explaining the origins of evil. He argues that what we usually call ""evil"" in rather a blanket fashion can actually be defined more accurately, and more usefully, as a deficit of empathy. Then he goes on to explain all the different ways that people can come about having a deficit of empathy, implications for possible rehabilitation, implications for our greater society, etc.The actual book is much more interesting than I am making it sound, though. While I was already familiar with a great percentage of the neuroscience/psychology information that he presented, he used it skillfully to explain and illustrate his beliefs. What I most enjoyed, however, is that (again, unlike some other popular science books that I have read recently) the case studies he used were also carefully chosen to illustrate his points - he just didn't include a description of every narcissist/psychopath/ASD person that he had met in his career. Eminently readable and enjoyable. I even enjoyed that it was quite short - I'd now like to read a more extended, in-depth version, though, or a rebuttal, if someone has written one, as he didn't really go into any viewpoints other than his own."
224,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1928100-stringy,4,"Why are people cruel to each other? This book is about the search for an answer, a fascinating pop-science take on the latest research into empathy. Baron-Cohen and his colleagues have been researching how empathy is created by the co-ordination of several areas in our brains, and how that system is affected by genetics, life experiences and damage via injury or strokes. He's written previously about people on the autism spectrum whose empathy system works in a non-standard way. He's interested in how they might be helped to comprehend empathy in a way that works for them, which seems to have promising avenues of research ahead. I'd like to follow up on his writing on this topic.But most of this book is about people with what he calls empathy disorders, such as psychopathy, narcissism and borderline personality disorder. He feels that a scientific explanation is more useful than simply labelling them 'evil' or 'mad'. It opens up avenues for prevention and cure, by repairing the empathy circuit or improved knowledge of the environmental factors which create healthy levels of empathy.Mostly what I liked is that Baron-Cohen is very clear about the line between what's currently known about empathy and what's still speculation requiring further research. He's convinced me that it's the kind of problem that could lead to a happier world if we could crack it open and understand it better. "
225,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24341612-karen,3,"The author happens to be the cousin of Sasha Baron-Cohen (as in BORAT). That notwithstanding, the book presents a pretty unshrinking and unhumorous look at the lack of empathy which allows people to be able to see others as objects, to commit atrocious cruelties upon them, and to feel no remorse. He provides some historic, collective examples of genocide and systematic torture; then he switches to discussing the individual, tracing out the Psychopath, Borderline, Narcissist, and Zero-negative (less common; think Asperger's) types in terms of behavioral, environmental and genetic causes. His goal in writing the book is to suggest the need for a change in the DSM-V, to identify a new category called ""Empathy Disorders."" He makes a compelling case ... I for one believe we do need more discussion about empathy both in everyday life (as opposed to the shame and blame that have the potential to make us shrivel inside) and in extreme circumstances. Interestingly, though, he brings up how empathy depends upon the ability to keep our own consciousness as well as that of another (akin to two spotlights) in our mind simultaneously; but he never mentions Jessica Benjamin, the profoundly insightful psychoanalyst who wrote about this ability--what she calls ""interdependence""--in her book BONDS OF LOVE, decades ago. I was surprised he didn't know it or reference it; seems a very odd oversight."

He argues that cruelty become possible when a person turns other people into objects. (Which Baron-Cohen freely admits isn't an idea new to him.)Baron-Cohen defines empathy as ""our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion."" suggesting there are at least two stages in empathy: recognition and response. (p 16) Baron-Cohen defines both psychopath and someone with autism as lacking in empathy. The difference being that the ""psychopath is aware that he is hurting someone because the 'cognitive' (recognition) element of empathy is (largely) intact, even if the 'affective' element (the emotional response to someone else's feeling) is not. The person with classic (low-functioning) autism often lacks both of these components of empathy."" (p. 120)I found Baron-Cohen's information and arguments interesting but not particularly novel. I have long personally defined evil as the lack of empathy, seeing people as objects rather than people.The prose itself and the way Baron-Cohen's ideas are presented are servicable but not particularly well-written.

When reading this you have to keep in mind that the definition of empathy is not that complex but not a narrow one. You need to see the that a single word (empathy) might be an umbrella term for a number of different component processes. In that respect, it is not much different to other psychological terms. For example, the term ‘language’ covers a number of different sub-systems (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, lexicon) as does the term ‘memory’ (long-term, short-term, episodic, semantic). With that being said, if someone's behaviour is the result of their low empathy, which itself stems from the underactivity of the brain's empathy circuit, and which ultimately is the result of their genetic make-up and/or their early experience, in what sense is the 'person' responsible?? These are complex medico-ethical issues. We obviously need to keep our socio-legal framework since it serves many valuable functions, including recognizing the victim or their family wanting to see justice done; but those with low empathy who end up in the criminal justice system also warrant our compassion, and may even warrant treatment within the health service. I have to admit this book left me with more questions and an unsettling feeling that our society isn't ready, or willing to look deeper and take into consideration this vision of 'empathy erosion'."

The Science of Evil by Simon Baron-Cohen (Sacha's cousin; he briefly mentions him in the book) gives an enticing peek into the potential of neurological research into better understanding why people harm others. His hypothesis is that certain people lack empathy. Of these, some act in a socially negative way while others, most notably, those suffering from autism spectrum (especially Asperger's Syndrome) have brains that enable them to highly systemize information (i.e., pick up and work with patterns). These people are much inclined to follow rules and therefore aren't inclined to violence. He surveys the nascent research showing how different parts of the brain relate to empathetic behavior and what genes and hormones may play a role. There aren't any answers here, just a provocative glimpse into the future of psychiatry and the need for more focused research. His stated goal was to try to shift the conversation of the source of evil from the realm of religion and philosophy into the sphere of science. He makes a good start."

I found it amusing because it resounded the views I have carried and shared for years - all the problems of the world would go away only if one (thought with rationality and) acted with empathy.Baron-Cohen expresses the same with more scientific insights into the minds of the unempathic, classifying them into various personality disorders and the effect of neurological wiring of such people as seen by the acts carried out by them.What I liked about the book was that B-C distances the cruel acts from the theological concept of evil on the basis of science and scientific studies, forcing the readers to, at the least, think that individuals with low or zero degree of empathy are acting on the predisposition of their mental and neurological states.Even more fascinating was his ending query - doesn't reducing the perpetrator to an object and sentencing him/her to death make us unempathic like the victims of our judgements? While the question of punishing the violent offenders is more social and complex than the simplicity posed by B-C, it at least provides some food for thought on how one might look at others and dispense judgements."

It also underlines the fact that, even though we may conceptualize personality disorders like BPD, NPD and AsPD as being Zero-Negatives from the empathy perspective, there are also Zero-Positives out there, namely autistic people who in spite of their complete lack of empathy can still have remarkable achievements due to their systemizing skills. The bad parts> The role of empathy as stated by Baron-Cohen seems to me exaggerated. Yes, empathy is important, but to regard it as a 'universal solvent' of problems and frustrations, I think it means to give it more credit than it is due. Also, the structure of the book seems at times very loose, even though the broadness of the topics adressed could be seen as a plus. Overall> It is an interesting book, the writing style is clear and concise, explaining all jargon terms and citing precisely the scientific literature. However, it could have been better. The theories it posits require of course further studying. "

Not to mention the book on deck ""wisdom of psychopaths."" Needless to say, I'm a blast at parties right now.Anyway, the main points of this book had to do with evil being based on empathy. Does one objectify others to the point that they are ... objects? That's the makings of evil. However, he used the concepts of zero-negative and zero-positive empathy. Differentiating between a psychopath (no empathy and disregard for the ability of others to even feel) and the autistic (lack of understanding to see they feel but not wanting to hurt others). Each has the potential to hit a child, for instance, but only the psychopath has the intention ... or at least the ability to tell that they are hurting others and not caring.The author put this in evolutionary terms to show how we may be getting different individuals ranging in the empathy spectrum and it hasn't been weeded out. The autistic tend to be much more adept at pattern recognition, which is an important facet to intellect. Seems they are inversely related."

I did have a bit of bother with all the references to the parts of the brain and what bit did what etc. The first chapter was also a tad harrowing. But this book really seized my imagination and truly blew me away. It investigates human cruelty and what drives, or allows it within the brain. Empathy, which is something that I used to just confuse with sympathy is a key player here. It is a fairly simple concept, but amazingly insightful. If we don't care about the person or their feelings, why would we give a shit if we upset or hurt them. Baron-Cohen looks at the parts of the brain and the chemical goings on that could cause one person to care deeply about their actions and another person who shows no response of what they inflict or a lack of consideration before acting in a cruel or hurtful manner. Experiments (all legal and non nasty)show how different brain activity appears to mould different personalites. I can't recommend this highly enough. Thanks to JJ Marsh for loaning me the book. Careful mind, it will have you judging all your friends and colleagues."

I also felt that the author's conclusions that rehabilitation can work for those with some of these serious disorders wasn't very well substantiated or supported. I'm not convinced that you can change some of these people who have the zero-empathy/personality disorders that cause them to be inhumane or cruel. There is no motivation for them to want to change their behavior, so I don't see how just treating them ""nicely"" is going to work.

(I'm not a professional neuroscientist, but my layperson's reading of the literature doesn't seem to support his construction there.) And his overarching thesis just kind of fell apart at that point for me. I'm not sure you're going to get a deep treatment of the autism spectrum as sort of a couple chapters side note in a book on empathy, but I felt he really didn't do justice to the connection he was attempting to make there. I do agree that there's interesting findings in how ordinary people bring themselves to dehumanize others and be terrible, and that genetics and environment both have roles, but that's such a set of bland statements that nearly everyone is going to agree with that.

Most of it stems from the part of the brain that activates ones Empathy. He really drives home the point people are not evil they are mental disabled.

There's many occasions where he begins to explore an idea but stops midway with the excuse 'this is yet to be tested' or 'this is still a new topic'. If you're gonna write a book about it and try to pioneer a whole movement in psychology about it, make the effort to do the research yourself... So yeah, I don't know if I can wholly trust the conclusions the guy comes to, nor do I feel like it's answered the questions of why humans perform acts of cruelty.It's obvious his speciality is zero empathy within autistic minds, as this is the subject he seems much more comfortable writing about, and that feels much more grounded in evidence. It was interesting to read about autism and the systematic, pattern-solving mentality but that's not what I picked the book up for. Otherwise I'd read a book on autism.

However I have become more aware of autistic elements of my make up and behaviour. And is somewhat confirmed with my lower than average scoring in the empathy test. I think I was over playing to the book so my actual EQ is likely higher than calculated, but still significantly less than average. Which I found fascinating.Somehow reading this book as giving me some useful insight into what make me, well me.

The author uses the examples of borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, psychopathy, and autism spectrum to illustrate extreme examples of impaired empathy (the author takes pains to emphasize that autism doesn't fall into the same category as the three personality disorders). The book is heavily annotated with references, but is fairly readable to the educated layman (keeping the regions of the brain straight was a challenge, though). It was enjoyable and interesting, but at the same time felt a bit short and shallow; I wanted more digging into the details (which, to be fair, may require the state of research to advance more).

Basically the underlying message to take home from this book is that ""evil"" can be equated to a lack of empathy. The most adaptive and practical way to live is to have a moderate level of empathy (everything in moderation); too little empathy (the ability to care for others and put yourselves in their shoes so to speak) allows for guiltless (and sometimes ignorant) cruelty, but too much empathy allows a stressful existence in which the empathizer negates their own needs by caring too much for others. All in all this was an interesting and informative exploration of the darker side of humanity. The extensive reference section will provide anyone with more information, should they wish for it. "

The widespread cruelty throughout history by leaders and collective groupings of people points in the direction of deeper biological factors that override empathy.

Baron-Cohen's argument for reclassifying certain mental illnesses as empathy disorders is persuasive and his discussion of these illnesses and the associated environmental and genetic backgrounds make the book worth reading. In fact, if the book had stuck with this key idea, I'd have given it 5/5. Unfortunately, the philosophical discussion is sorely lacking. I'm not convinced that lack of empathy is a necessary condition for cruelty and as Baron-Cohen notes, it's never a sufficient explanation. A 'theory of human cruelty' ought to be more thorough. Baron-Cohen's discussion of the implications of his theory is also lacking: He merely states his opinions, rather than arguing for them. (At least he is intellectually honest in this.)

The next deals with the Nazis as part of that book and this one, and the first two, include the German Hitler Nazis too.

""Evil"" is a religious concept, which does not really explain cruelty at all. It makes much more sense to think about cruelty in terms of empathy disorders, which result from a combination of biological and environmental influences, which determine temporary or permanent underactivity of neural empathic circuits. The Holocaust is in this interpretation a result of a combination of small unempathic acts, not of small banal evil acts. The difference is crucial. No one - however evil we paint them to be - should be treated as 100 percent bad or as beyond responding to a humane approach. Showing empathy to the perpetrator, not just repeating the crime of turning the perpetrator into an object and thus dehumanizing them, should be a way to react to cruelty."

The main focus of this book was the empathy gene. The author had very good points and the first few chapters were very interesting, but as the book should have been shorter. I feel the author meant well, but dragged things on for too long. I really enjoyed the charts becasue that helped me visualize this. I also liked how the author talked a lot about autism and had some connection stories or application stories. Overall, this book was really good information wise, but towards the end I almost had to force myself to finish it. "

Baron-Cohen lays out a great argument for empathy as being one of our most valuable resources.He describes a state of Zero-Negative empathy as active exploitation of others (Psychopaths, Narcissists, Borderline Personality Disorder). He continues to argue that having zero empathy is not always bad as he elaborates on Zero-Positive empathy (Aspergers, autism spectrum) as those who have no Theory of Mind but do not intentionally hurt others. Some even benefit from the deficiency by having a skill in Systemizing, wherein they possess a super-focus and near-limitless memory for learning patterns."
261,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780400-ismail-n,3,"A mediocre read at best, the author attempts to remove the stigma associated with the word ""evil,"" and replace the concept with a more substantive ideological framework. The framework views ""evil"" as a lack of empathy, rather than an empty diatribe. In addressing this, the author covers 4 psychological conditions; narcissism, borderline personality, psychopaths, and autism. He juxtaposes the the cons of a lack of empathy (zero negative) and pros (zero positive), and explains how zero positives have benefited civilization. I recommend this read as a fun method of addressing such a controversial tag line- that being evil."

I especially liked the short discussion of bowlby's 'pot of gold' theory and the discussion of systematizing in people with autism. But for the most part it is too speculative, and too many findings you'd expect in a phd thesis rather than a popular book. Also at times felt more like a historical commentary on other work that has been done in this field rather than a new contribution to it. Also, whilst he clearly centralises the importance of psychoanalysis and constantly comes back to it, he never incorporates any psychoanalytic theory in his discussion which seems a major flaw"

I also believe that while there are probably stable levels of empathy in personalities, cultural roles have often proven easily able to over-ride this circuit for otherwise normal people, i.e. the famous class where undergraduates were divided into ""prison guards"" and ""prisoners,"" and abuses of power by the ""guards"" quickly spiraled out of control.

He has discovered it all starts in the brain and the way it is wired. A malfunction of the wiring causes a lack of empathy or caring how other people feel.

Sometimes you glean just one thing from a book that helps formulate your thinking, and this book gave me new outlooks on empahy and evil. I learned so much on how he determined that evil is really a lack of empathy with LOTS of variations, and we're all on a bell curve. Some day I'll pick it up again.

Still, the tour the author gives of empathy-related disorders is fascinating and although the case for a common chemistry that ties together everything from borderline personality disorder to NPD to autism is outside my ken, it was interesting to see the various ways that a lack of empathy can manifest, and to think about how big a role empathy plays in the social order."

By redefining ""evil"" as a question of empathy, he attempts to create a space where we can more directly identify, prevent, and treat evil on an individual and cultural scale. Equal parts biological, psychological, and cultural, the book is a fascinating approach to conflict prevention and resolution, but he may be pushing it a bit too far. Still, he creating space for optimism in the face of darkness, and I applaud his efforts. "

Baren-Cohen (not the comedian, but that Baron-Cohen's cousin), argues that the development of empathy comes from a combination of wiring in the brain and experience from our youth. There are some interesting case studies, as well."

The main personality types associated this condition are psychopaths, narcissists, borderline personality and autism disorders. Cohen explains that those displaying no empathy are often lacking in particular neurological circuits , whilst abuse, neglect and other childhood factors can influence this behaviour.

I give it 5 stars not because Baron-Cohen's writing is sublime (it's workmanlike) but because of the concise and clear manner in which he tackles his subject. This book alongside Lieberman's Social should be required reading for everyone. The glitzy title helps this book sell in America where Empathy is a decidedly ""not macho"" notion but Baron-Cohen explains the importance of empathy and how neuroscientists are trying to understand both it's absence and how to cultivate it. Read this book. "
275,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,3,"Starts strong and gets redundant pretty quickly. A lot of pseudoscience and leaping to conclusions (which seem to me to be probably correct but still require a more solid base of evidence to be put forward for the author to make such confident assertions as he does here).This reads more like a long form essay. There isn't enough new information here to fill a book so Baron Cohen waxes on and reiterates his arguments as infinitum. It's telling that the final chapter is put forward as a sort of ""in summation"" addendum and yet takes up 40 pages of a ~190 page book."

This resulted in a lightbulb moment for me and provided a helpful context in many cases.I haven't yet read Baron-Cohens other writing on autism, but it is an area of professional expertise for me and his take is worth my time as it presents things from a unique perspective.
