0,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,3," This is an informative book about eating: about how taste preferences are formed, and how we can change them, and why it's so hard to start eating healthily when you're used to the opposite, and about eating disorders and their treatment. One of the things I learned from this book is that I do not enjoy reading about eating for nearly 300 pages, so if you love foodie books, your rating will likely be higher than mine. Those three stars represent my level of enjoyment rather than the quality of the book.In case you, too, are unlikely to read the entire book, here's the short version. Tastes are developed, not inborn (as anyone who's ever deliberately cultivated a taste for something you once disliked knows). So, anyone can learn to like healthy food – which is what anyone who wants to eat healthier must do, because nobody sticks with a diet that feels like punishment at every meal. The best way to develop good taste in children is to start very young: babies are particularly open to new flavors at 4–7 months of age. But once you're past that, let children choose among healthy foods without forcing anything down their throats, and keep offering small amounts until they start to like it. This actually works at any age, even for extremely picky eaters.But the way we eat in the first world has gone badly wrong, with an abundance of cheap food offering poor nutrition. It doesn't help that our methods of training children to eat are inherited from a time when famine, rather than obesity, was the primary danger: hence the fact that ""cleaning your plate"" is considered virtuous. People are healthier when they regulate their eating based on actual hunger, rather than external cues like portion size, or dealing with emotions by eating.If you are going to read a book related to diet in some way, I suspect that this is the sanest option you'll find: the author isn't pushing any particular diet, or cutting out any category of food entirely. She does recommend eating primarily fruits and veggies and limiting the processed foods (which I think all can agree is the healthiest way to eat), but focuses on the importance of finding dishes you enjoy, and then expanding that list – nobody likes everything, which is okay. And enjoying a slice of cake every now and then won't hurt you, though a diet primarily based on processed and sugary foods likely will.So I certainly found some interesting material here, and I think it's useful information for anyone looking to improve their own diet, and especially for parents who want to teach their children to eat right. It will be an interesting read also for foodies interested in the historical and scientific information the author presents; Wilson provides a good historical overview of the topic and discusses many relevant studies. However, I found the book a little padded and longer than necessary, as a reader who was interested in the information but didn't relish the time spent reading it. For the only book about food and eating that I'm likely to read, though, it seems like a good choice."
1,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112117-christina-dudley,4,"If you read a lot of food/foodie/nutrition books, which I do, the first part of this book will seem very familiar. There's the talk about obesity, processed foods, the disconnect between what we know to be good for us and our eating habits. Many of the same studies put in an appearance--the starving Minnesotans, the one that let babies eat whatever they wanted from a selection of whole foods, and so on---but Wilson's recap is thoughtful and informative. Where she heads into new territory is discussing how we learn to dis/like the foods we dis/like. It turns out picky eating isn't all or even mostly genetic. It turns out we can relearn what foods we like and increase the variety of what we eat at any age. I was fascinated by the history of advice for baby feeding and the discussions of various eating disorders. Let me just say, after reading about some of the cases in the book, I will never call any of my kids picky eaters again.This would make a great book club book, if only because food is a subject of such universal torture/interest/love, and trying to get kids to ""eat healthy"" consumes most moms, if only with guilt.Although my son is 14, and I'd decided he was never gonna be a kid who ate many vegetables, I was inspired by FIRST BITE to try one of the techniques they use on toddlers. I cut a green bean into pea-sized chunks and put it on his plate with one twig from a broccoli florette. The result? He ate them! He even had another green bean, cut up. Dare I hope he will one day graduate to eating an entire bean, or even a few of them? We'll see. But next I'm trying a pea-sized chunk of a roasted beet.(Thank you to the publisher for allowing me to review a galley copy.)"
2,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22396061-saba-imtiaz,5,"As someone who has spent most of her life struggling with weight and diets, this book was an incredible revelation. First Bite is not some self righteous call to abandon one's unhealthy eating habits overnight, but it explores how our habits develop, the emotions and experiences that shaped them, and how to be cognisant of this history. It explains how to slowly start to change one's relationship and perception of food, and to adopt tastes that make all meals seem like comfort food. Highly, highly recommended."
3,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16802193-bob-schnell,3,"Advanced reading copy review Due to be published December 1, 2015I enjoyed Bee Wilson's previous book ""Swindled"" so was happy to try her latest food-related book ""First Bite: How We Learn to Eat"". This is not food porn, lusciously describing our first tastes of beloved dishes. Instead it is a scientific observation of how we learn to like and dislike certain foods and spices and how those preferences shape our diets. It is also a guide to how we can change our eating habits towards more healthy and nutritious foods without losing any sense of pleasure in eating.Despite the parade of studies and their results, the book is at times fascinating, largely interesting and educational. The author personalizes some of the theories presented with her own struggles with food. We learn about the psychology and physiology of eating and how culture plays as much of a part in our diets as society and advertising. While not all chapters were as interesting to me as others, I still never felt the need to skim through to the better parts. While the book would be the greatest help to new parents who want to start their children off on the right foot nutritionally, it would also be helpful to adults who want to change their dietary habits and try new things."
4,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"This very readable book argues clearly and cogently that eating habits aren’t inevitable and can be changed. It is most definitely not a diet book, though. Wilson marshals a range of scientific research and history to explain how babies and children learn which foods they do and don’t like and how our adult habits are formed. I found this fascinating, as I had no idea about it before. Did you know what babies can learn to like tastes at four months? So young! The book covers childhood experiences of food in great detail, as these shape what we eat and how we feel about it as adults. Wilson's tone is sympathetic and thoughtful, noting that it’s very difficult to know what and how much is healthy to eat currently. Rather than focusing on the food industry, though, she explains how individuals and families experience it. I appreciated that her focus wasn’t entirely on the developed world and that she didn’t treat her case studies of picky and disordered eaters in a voyeuristic fashion.I found 'First Bite' a little difficult to read in places, not due to style but due to content. I was a very picky eater as a child and have had problems with food all my life, so some parts hit rather close to home. In some ways, Wilson’s book is very encouraging, as it argues you can improve your relationship with food at any age. However, it also doesn’t downplay how much effort can be involved. Wilson explains that giving people advice on lifestyle changes doesn’t work: they have to want to change rather than feeling defensive. I spotted an interesting contradiction between apparently effective treatments for picky eating and anorexia. The former requires freedom to try unfamiliar foods in tiny amounts until reassured they’re safe to eat, without family pressure. The latter apparently requires the opposite: meals with the family in which the sufferer is firmly encouraged to eat more. The chapter about hunger also made me realise what a mysterious sensation it is. Hunger cannot be medically measured via any hormone, enzyme, or similar. It can only be self-reported and different people may not experience it in the same way.Undoubtedly this book will cause any reader to reflect on their eating habits and how they might want to change them. It taught me a great deal about the biology and history of feeding babies and children, as well as Japanese cuisine. Wilson refuses to give specific advice, but ends the book with a bullet point list of things about eating she wishes she’d learned earlier. This includes a suggestion to eat soup, which I did after finishing the book."
5,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33398563-emma,2,"Just as with the other Bee Wilson book I read previously, I was left feeling a bit disappointed by this one. The first half of the book was incredibly boring, with long chapters that focussed on feeding (your own) children, rather than using childhood as an illustration of how adults once learned to eat. The second half of the book was definitely more interesting and discussed eating disorders and how taste preferences are formed, and how you can manipulate it through exposure.While reading, I never had the feeling that I was reading about something very exciting or about groundbreaking science. A lot of the studies that Wilson discussed in length are from the previous century, and although they may still serve as an important turning point in the study of eating behavior, they are just not that relevant anymore as studies that were done on a way larger scale in the 21st century.Furthermore, a lot of ideas keep getting repeated over and over, and I feel like I have read certain sentences in multiple chapters in the book, and also in her other book (that I read first), This Is Not A Diet Book. The in-depth explanation behind her statements that I was looking for after reading TINADB, unfortunately did not come in this book.I don’t know if my interest in food books has dwindled, or that my education has taught me how to distinguish pop-science from actual science-based books, but I think Bee Wilson is just not the food-writer for me. I think this book would have interested me more if I had young children myself, because the book pays a lot of attention to how to feed them better, and how to help picky eaters expand their horizons. "
6,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973558-shiloah,4,There is so much goodness packed into this book. I recommend it to anyone who eats. 😀. I especially recommend it to parents. There is info with inspiration for everyone.
7,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201113-rebecca,4,"The minute this book entered my consciousness (reviewed in the Guardian, of course), I couldn't wait to read it. While I generally consider myself a pretty tolerant person, one of the few things that really winds me up are fussy eaters, so a book exploring how and why we develop our tastes and dislikes promised to be very interesting. Wilson groups extreme fussy eating (where disliked foods are basically phobias) as an eating disorder as serious as anorexia, an idea which certainly gave me pause for thought - although I'm still not convinced that your common or garden adult fussy eater is suffering from a mental disorder so much as a bit undisciplined! And, as becomes clear throughout the book, it certainly takes discipline to break the fussy eating habit... The treatment ideas she discusses such as repeated exposure (see The Man Who Ate Everything for more on this) aren't exactly new to me, but Wilson brings them together and offers a good mix of theory with practical tips, whether the reluctant eater is yourself or your child. It's also not only a book about fussy eating, but really all the issues people today have with food - overeating, comfort eating, binging and purging - and Wilson also shares her own food experiences and history, along with a lot of other people's stories, so there's really something for anyone looking to mend their relationship with food, or just interested in food psychology.Her writing is very enjoyable and easy to read, if sometimes rather hyperbolic - for example, aparently 'no home-cooked food, no matter how delicious, can match the power for bringing people together in misty-eyed recollection of industrially produced food.' Sorry, what? That certainly hasn't been my exerience, and I don't think that I and the people I'm around are that unusual. But the overall importance of her topic meant that I could forgive the occassional headscrachting overstatements.My one concern is whether this book is most likely going to be preaching to the wide-eating, food literate crowd, rather than those it could help the most. But if anyone who is a fussy eater but wants to change does pick it up, I think it will certainly be very helpful and encouraging.Thanks to Netgalley for the chance to read this."
8,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301240-patty,3,"A nonfiction book about the psychology of eating: how and why people become picky eaters, and how to change; how the body signals and interprets hunger; eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia (a really interesting detail I'd never heard before is that there's apparently increasing evidence that anorexia is genetic and not highly linked to pressure on teenage girls to diet - though of course such pressure is still negative and can cause other problems); cultural pressure to link certain tastes to gender (for instance, sweets for women and meat for men); different cultural traditions of how to introduce new foods to children; basically, every topic you could imagine related to taste preferences.All of that was quite interesting and fun to read about. My main problem with the book is that, unlike Wilson's previous books, the information is not presented simply for the sake of being interesting, but with the attitude that it's necessary to learn these things in order to deal with the modern world's obesity problem. It's not a diet book (thankfully!) but over and over again Wilson emphasizes that it's important to do such research and apply such findings because no one knows how to eat anymore and we need to fix that. Which, if you're perfectly happy with how you eat, is a bit annoying to read, and certainly not what I expected from the book. So, be warned. If that's not too much of a problem for you, there is a lot of cool new information here, and I'd give it a qualified recommendation. I read this as an ARC via NetGalley."
9,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed the research and presentation of the book by Wilson, as much as I enjoy a good Mary Roach book or A Natural History of the Senses because it is well-researched and straightforwardly organized, as evidenced by the twenty some-odd pages of notes and research but also that my favorite chapter was actually the epilogue called This is Not Advice where she summarizes the main points of the book. I basically read this chapter out loud to my husband after he heard bits and pieces of studies or findings from the book as I read it, but this truly encapsulates everything-- my favorite-- ""eating well is a skill"". She covers a lot of group, but again, because it is organized in its presentation, it was all digestible and early understood, though of course there were chapters that I was less interested in, yet there were also sections that I was leaned in to or nodding my head in agreement with (being a 'maintainer' but also about feeding children).Thank you to Bee Wilson for a sophisticated and educational reading on eating. Hook: Natural science, nonfiction, compelling, contemporary, thought provoking, fact-filled, introspective"
10,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,4,"First Bite is a bit of a departure for Bee Wilson. She usually writes about food history, as in her excellent books Consider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eat and Swindled:The Dark History of Food Fraud, as well as her many articles and reviews in magazines such as The London Review of Books.In this book she investigates how and why we acquire food preferences, and the consequences of those preferences. This involves her delving into biology, chemistry, history, sociology, and a great deal of personal experience. The science and history of how we decide what and what not to eat is fascinating, although I was not as interested in the emphasis on the many ways that children fail to eat properly or even at all sometimes. Probably those who are parents or who have vivid memories of their own childhood experiences with food will appreciate these discussions more.Perhaps the most important finding that Wilson details is that food preferences are not set in stone -- you can learn to enjoy food that you've always avoided. Further, whole societies (Japan is her best example) can change their diets for the better. It gives us all a bit of hope that we can reverse the alarming trends of the past several decades.Wilson also branches out into new territory by actually providing some recommendations on how to deal with the food idiosyncrasies of children and with our own diets as adults.(Thanks to NetGalley and Basic Books for a digital review copy.)"
11,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156993-andrea,4,"This book is getting a fourth star from me for two main reasons. First, if I had to describe this book in one word, it would be “hopeful” and I feel like hope is something many of us need to hear about both our personal eating habits and the rising obesity trends around the world. Second, this was super readable (though I really like cognitive psychology so that could be my personal preference). Overall, this book presents the argument that eating well is a skill – something we learn, can unlearn, and can always improve upon. Drawing on tons of research, the book presents evidence for how our taste preferences are formed and just how malleable they can be. I also really enjoyed the sections about “disordered eating” beyond eating disorders, because YES – eating your feelings or eating for reasons that have nothing to do with hunger or NOT eating because of feelings are all issues. More than anything, this book is about the craziness of our culture in how we think about how children eat, picky eaters, and even the different ways we perceive feeding females versus males. Lots of interesting ideas here and some great practical advice for raising children with healthy, varied palettes as well as “introducing” adults to new foods and flavors. "
12,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,Actual rating : 3.5 stars
13,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I found this book fascinating and recommend it to anyone interested in food, cooking, psychology, children eating habits or the history of eating. I am going to seek out other books by Bee Wilson. It was an engaging read for an interesting topic. I also liked the mini chapters on certain foods.One take away is that the WHO (World Health Organization) states that newborns should not eat anything other than breast milk (or formula) until 6 months old. The studies Ms. Wilson state show that this is not a good idea long term. She and other scientists state the best time to expose babies to new foods and tastes is between 4-8 month range. Other countries, like France, do this with great results. If you wait until after this time, they will be much more adverse to new flavors. They still advocate getting most nutrients from breast milk, but that parents should take advantage of this short window to get their babies trying new things. I honestly will look into that more if we have more children. I followed the doctors advice and waited until 6 months, but my children are not great natural eaters. We eat healthy and my kids always have to eat what we do, but they are resistant eaters. I also have been putting into practice the idea of ""tiny bites."" It has already transformed my 6 and 3 year old into cucumber lovers, they both used to hate them! I hope to continue to do this to get them to try and enjoy new foods. I also hope to help myself get over my adversity to fish. I also love the idea of teaching children to be good eaters, to enjoy healthy foods and that our tastes can change!I also found the history really interesting! All in all, a great read!"
14,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54339850-beth,4,"Well-researched and thought-provoking. Some aspects of this novel really resonated with my own experiences. A bit repetitive and circuitous, so skimming is sufficient. "
15,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7399091-cathie,2,"I was looking forward to reading Bee Wilson’s upcoming novel First Bite: How We Learn To Eat. A British food writer and historian, I was anticipating a most intriguing read! However, I wasn’t expecting a huge portion of the book to be devoted towards early developmental childhood psychology. And that is how I felt when reading this.She talks about children as picky eaters and child obesity. This obviously would be better geared toward those with children and ways to watch their nutrition. However, for me with two grown daughters, I can only say I will keep as reference for when I have grandchildren. Had I been aware of this, I perhaps would have sat down with that expectation.On that note, there is a chapter on “much of what we learn about eating comes from the way our parents feed us.” This is a truly hard pill to swallow. At times, it is the habits we share with our children that can impact how our children view eating. At times, views on consumption directly and indirectly influences the direction of what food is and what it means to us. A family’s income also influences eating habits as much as guilt and peer pressure.Towards the end she gets into what I was most interested in.Our memory of food lends itself into what we not only were exposed to, but the feelings that came with that memory. The author states that eating is a form of learned behavior. But for me it is much more that that. It’s the experiences while eating that can be pleasurable or that our taste buds just do not agree with.Our perception of eating can evolve as we begin to expose ourselves to what is changing in our economy and society. The past few years, there has been a sprouting of neighborhood farmers markets. There has been an economic shift in price for organic. Restaurateurs are touting cage free. What is significant is that our behaviors towards eating can evolve just by the changes that have taken place and what is yet to come.How our past exposure to food culture and what triggers how our eating habit carries into our food consumption and the behaviors we associate with certain foods we were exposed to throughout our lives. Yes, our early childhood does impact our exposure, but a lot of that is not by choice; hence, I don’t feel that should have been the basis of half her book.I was looking for more than “we are what we eat”. It felt like this was a psychology piece on the need to unlearn eating behaviors in order to change our eating habits. Our eating habits are a part of us -and not all eating habits should be associated as to whether we are healthy or unhealthy eaters.Just wanted to share I thought this novel would be about the history of eating habits and one’s senses, culture, economics, et.al. This stems from my expectation based on the title, the book jacket, and a few book blurbs I can across which had piqued my interest.Disclaimer: I received this book in exchange for a fair review. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review."
16,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2868062-haley-keller,5,"First Bite is all about how people develop their sense of taste. As someone who has always been a picky eater (although I'd like to think I've branched out more now that I'm older), I'm fascinated by how people come to like certain things and not others. It's an exploration of something that is related to nutrition but also isn't like other nutrition books I've read. First Bite isn't really concerned with stressing what's healthy and unhealthy. It's just exploring why people come to eat certain foods and not others. I don't think that's something many people think about, yet it's such an interesting question.I learned so, so much from this book. It raised so many new questions that I've never stopped to think about. Sure, I'd thought before how different cultures have different tastes, and I knew it had to come from what they were fed growing up. But I didn't think about it beyond that. Wilson explores that in First Bite though, including why some cultures come to tolerate spicy foods easier than others. I'd always assumed that people who like spicy food developed some sort of tolerance where they can't taste the spiciness as much anymore. It turns out that I was wrong, and the real theory about how people come to tolerate spice wasn't what I expected.First Bite seems to explore so much, from how the diet of the mother affects breast milk and a baby's future diet to why junk food has become such a big component of today's diets. All of it was fascinating and some really great information. I think anyone is bound to learn something from this book, and it really makes you stop and think about how your own diet came about. But it's never preachy about what you should or shouldn't be eating, even if it makes you stop to think about why your favorite foods are your favorite foods.I'd recommend this book to just about everyone. We all eat, and we've all developed our own unique tastes that have been influenced by a number of factors. This book is a great way to learn more about how that happened and get you thinking about how you wound up eating the diet that you have.I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.http://hmweasley-blog.blogspot.com/20..."
17,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12362120-annikky,3,"A good, thoughtful book that would have benefitted from stricter editing - I found it repetitive in places, although possibly because I did not need much convincing that what and how we eat is largely learned, not determined by genes. That said, I think in making that point, it glosses over some thorny issues - most significantly our near universal love for sugar, fat and salt. The fact itself is mentioned nearly on every page, but then curiously sidestepped: the book seems to suggest that once we learn to like vegetables, all will be well. It also cannot quite decide if it's a self-help book for parents or a meditation on food and eating in general. Still, it makes many excellent points and people who have children or consider having them would do well to read it. "
18,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4786937-kats,4,"A very interesting read on how to change and influence our eating habits and likes/dislikes at any stage of our life. The research is extensive, and even the anecdotal studies are fascinating. I have learnt what I should have done differently with my children when they were really tiny, and how I need to lay off making them finish what's on their plates. A super book for anyone who wants the inside scoop about better and healthier eating, with side dishes of learning about eating disorders and the history of food. I very much recommend it! "
19,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2070861-sarah-obsesses-over-books-cookies,3,too much research... but if you like to learn about food and why we pick what we do to eat go for this one. well done but too dry for me.

21,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14819719-imrankhan-mulla,3,"This is a book about food; about eating habits – how we develop them and they develop us.‘We all begin life with an innate liking for sweetness and a suspicion of bitterness, yet there is nothing inevitable in our physiology that says we will grow up dreading vegetables and craving fudge. The trouble is, we do not tend to see it this way.’Much like intelligence/character, people around us are quick to brand us at an early age – this one is intelligent/she is shy/he has a sweet tooth like his father. The reality is far from it – our food preferences are a learned habit, not something we are born with or doomed to accept. However early judgments become self-fulfilling prophecies as our options are limited based on them. If you are only given sweet foods as treats, how will you ever see anything else as a treat?Every man carries within him a world,Which is composed of all that he has seen and loved,and to which he constantly returns, even when he is traveling through, and seems to be living in, some different world.- Francois-Rene ChateaubriandTo give it a personal context – I left India at the age of 24 – never having been outside. My exposures to foreign foods was limited to American fast food and Indian-ized version of Chinese food (bearing no resemblance to authentic Chinese food). Due to cultural and constraints of tropical weather, I was deeply suspicious of anything served remotely close to raw (salads, sushi, etc.). My first experiences outside confirmed my ingrained biases – “I hate salad/sushi or How could anyone like something so bland and boring or Health food is meant to be a punishment”. By virtue of personal endeavor, forced circumstances (lack of familiar options), and sometimes cajoling/coaxing/persuasion from friends (Shout out to Ellen, Jade in particular) – I ‘discovered’ my love for foods and cuisines that I previously considered repulsive. Had I boxed myself in and the considered the biases fed to me as fate and resigned myself to them, I would have deprived myself of the sensory experiences that have become a memorable part of my life.Back to the book – This book is interesting I parts – perhaps less appealing to me as I had previously read some of the concepts. I wasn’t so interested in the eating disorders and teaching children to eat parts which make up half the book, but found the rest of it quite well researched and put together. Overall, there is a lot to learn from the book, especially given how significantly your food habits impact your life (your intelligence/looks/health/energy/ability to think or enjoy life) – even if you don’t care about food in and of itself. If you don’t have the time to read it, my top takeaways for you (or teaching your children) are as below:- Don’t take your food preferences as your destiny. We eat what we like and we only like what we know. Don’t let others decide your fate for you – go out and try everything, find what you like or don’t for yourself (you will be surprised how little you know yourself)- Try something multiple times, not just once, even a small bite at a time – don’t be quick to judge, let your familiarity and fondness grow over time- Pay attention to what you eat, understand your nutritional needs and set up a system that works for you. You are what you eat – what you eat will change and define you in more ways you realize.- Food preferences are more psychological (based on if you were forced to eat something or given it as a treat, and how happy you were when ate it) than physiological (based on genetics or your taste buds). Memory is the single most powerful driving force in how we learn to eat; it shapes all of our yearnings.Lastly, food is an important part of our identity, and learning to form a positive relationship with food is in many ways learning to have a positive relationship with the world around you including people and life experiences."
22,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2158493-sophie,4,"Sometimes you stumble about a book often enough that it feels like you don't have a choice in reading it. In this case, I first came across it in a magazine lying around at work before then reading a fascinating article on clean eating (https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandst...) that made me want to read more by the author (if you're at all interested in eating healthily I highly recommend the article, it's good stuff). So anyway, I relented and got this book and I'm glad I did. ""First bite"" is a book about how our eating habits are formed pretty much from the moment we are born. It's also about how we can still change these habits even as grown ups. Most importantly, while she does emphasize the benefits of eating more vegetables, it's less a book about eating ""better"" and more about developing more healthy attitudes towards food and looking at eating as a skill you can work on. While the ultimate conclusion is nothing new as such, there was lots of stuff in here that was new to me and eye opening and genuinely interesting to read. It also serves as an inspiration to reassess my relationship with food in a gentle way, which I really appreciate. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in food and nutrition; again, if you want to get an idea what Bee Wilson's writing is like, give the article linked above a try.

Bee Wilson explores the at times dysfunctional relationships we have food: covering the development of our first likes and dislikes, the influence of cultural stereotypes on our preferences and last but not least eating disorders: such as extreme pickiness and anorexia. She is extremely good at discussing the manner in which picky children should be introduced to new food- though I'm sure the practice is trickier than the theory! Most importantly however, Wilson underlines that our relationship to food can change- you can learn to prefer broccoli to fries, and you can give up on milk in your coffee. She underlines however that the feelings of deprivation associated with dieting are the main reason why people eventually rebound. Instead, she suggests that you do not forbid ourselves our favourite food completely- but that you stick to strict mealtimes, and make sure that our portions fit on smaller plates. I will use her advice in my struggle to eat more healthy foods and reduce snacking... we'll see how it goes."
24,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4296574-joshua-gross,4,"This book was densely packed with delicious information about food, how children develop their food tastes, eating disorders, and changing how we eat food and what we like and dislike. I find it fascinating all that's learned about flavors and food preferences in early childhood, and how that effects us as adults. I also enjoyed learning about food cultures in other countries like England and Japan, particularly how Japan changed their eating habits completely over time to one of the healthiest diets in the world. I listened to the audiobook of this and disliked the voice and tone of the woman reading it, and it was also a bit long and could be a little dry at times, but overall I really enjoyed this book."

It works really nicely with our way of baby led weaning. Western society has really messed up so many people. I didn't realize the extent of many disordered ways of eating. Many of the vegetable descriptions are just delicious, much of this book made me hungry. "

Her chapters were so very long and they kept talking about the same thing over and over again.So, I guess it was okay."

Instead, it turned out to be filled with summaries of practical research on how children learn what is good to eat, and how adults, too, can change their habits.

37,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29576-megan,3,"Lately, I find myself giving three-star reviews more and more often, and I imagine it has to do with the sheer quantity of books I've been reading. What would have qualified as a four- or even five-star book has now become a three, but I don't enjoy these now three-star books any less than I used to. In fact, I recommend them frequently... and such is the case with First Bite. I've recommended First Bite to several friends and acquaintances. It is chock full of information that I've never seen before, fascinating morsels I would have never even thought to explore. ""How We Learn to Eat"" is an apt subtitle, the best and most complete description of the content possible - Bee Wilson probes the topic thoroughly - but perhaps not as enticing a subtitle as the book deserves. The problem, I suspect, is that the subject seems to be well-known, obvious territory. It is not. Our common and common-sense knowledge turns out to be by-and-large wrong. I was stunned to learn that there are proven therapies for resolving picky eating, that *exclusive* breastfeeding is likely inadvisable after 6 months, that Japan's food culture was consciously constructed after World War II, etc. I learned about the unexpected identity-crisis that often comes with anosmia (loss of the sense of smell/taste) - a lesson that led to a beautiful and unexpected conversation with a colleague who'd suffered a traumatic brain injury and lost his sense of taste.I'm not sure that many people would say they're interested in ""how we learn to eat,"" but there many people who should be: parents and parents-to-be, first and foremost, but also anyone interested in learning to eat better - learning to eat more healthfully, with greater variety, or with greater enjoyment. Learning to eat may seem as simple a process as learning to breathe - something done so early and so naturally it need not be revisited in adulthood. Bee Wilson encourages us that learning to eat is a lifelong, complex process, and one we'd do well to do more consciously. "
38,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18816982-marie,4,"I picked this up because I am a big fan of Bee Wilson's ""Consider the Fork"" (a history of eating and cooking through tools) and the topic of food preferences struck close to home as the mother of two toddlers. Wilson's created a fascinating story outlining how we 	learned our likes and dislikes - from our families, our culture and history, our food environment, and loosely from our biology and how closely our food choices are tied to our emotions. More usefully, she describes different techniques educators, health professionals, and scientists have used successfully and unsuccessfully to improve the relationship we have with food for picky children, people with eating disorders, and picky adults. I immediately instituted the Tiny Tastes method for the boys at our house (with stickers) and I have to say it's helping. Mainly to me though, Wilson shows evidence that no one can convince you to eat better (which we all in our heart of hearts know). Guilt and the label 'healthy' are both bad seasoning. In order to eat 'healthily' you have to actually LIKE what you're eating - but you can, with exposure and persistence, grow to like and crave what is good for us. I have a few foods on my list to work on. Olives, one day I will happily eat you on your own..."
39,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31388894-sarah,5,"First review:Super recommend! This is a very good read, although it has a significantly different feel and style than her first book. Readers invested in essentially a repeat performance (the same writing on a similar topic) won't find it, but it is still a wonderful book with oodles of great information. A good suggestion for Mary Roach fans.--Second review:I was asked to reread this to lead a book group meeting at a branch. Since I suggested this title when brainstorming for the group, I could hardly turn down such an opportunity, especially since I liked it so much the first time I read it. I was shoving ARCs and library copies into the hands of family and coworkers left, right, and center.It was interesting for me to reread this as I tackle my anti-inflammation diet and binge on cookbooks. The author 's main point, repeated throughout the book, is that eating (food choices, really) is a learned behavior, and if it's something you can learn, then it's something you can unlearn or relearn. That felt very hopeful to me. When the author talked about her own history with an eating disorder, it reminded me very strongly of some of the sentiments and points in Hunger; they would make good companion books, to read together. Still highly recommended."
40,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4225235-lauren,5,"It was so interesting, and I keep telling people things this book has taught me. Eating habits, tastes, history of our exposure to new tastes, food socialization, memory-the whole thing. Completely based on the science of food and nutrition and eating over the last 150 years (and when the footnotes take up 12 percent of the kindle version, you know it's well researched!) It's such an engaging and well written book about so many things, and never lectures readers about how they *should* be eating, just exposes us to the reasons why we eat the way we do. Loved the bits about how we develop the things we love, the bits about how memories of food keep us sane when we're in new places (hit home for the PCVs haha). Crazy good. Can't wait to buy it and highlight the whole thing. NetGalley gave me a copy for an honest review."
41,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1926715-cayla,4,"Great book on how children learn to eat. I have to admit this book was different than I expected. I expected more of a how-to guide to child nutrition. This was not the case. The author was in fact pretty opposed to telling people what to do. The book more provided information on how we develop tastes and learn our food habits. All really good information and I liked that the reader was left deciding what to do with that information.I found it interesting that there is a taste window with babies from 4-7 months where they are particularly open to new flavors. Children also need to taste foods multiple times to learn to like them. The discussion on children's food was also on point. I found the first few chapters and the last chapter the most interesting. The chapters on hunger and disorder were interesting, but were less helpful when deciding how to feed my baby."
42,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14229745-karen,5,"My intention was to skim this expose on eating for a few nuggets of new information, but I found myself savoring every word. Well, the half chapter on the history of feeding toddlers in England got a bit tedious what with rice pudding being the mainstay for several centuries, but the rest was interesting and useful. Tiny amounts of solid food should be introduced to children early since 4 through 6 months are a window when new tastes are welcome and make a lifelong impression. And for those who are grown, there is still hope. It turns out that the palate is as plastic as the brain, and simple familiarity is often all that's needed to learn to love the food we once found disgusting. Much good advice on encouraging picky eaters, including ourselves."
43,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50256886-katie,5,"I like to read diverse range of books, more often than not though- it's a diverse range of fiction! This book called to me though, probably because of how good the carrot on the front cover of my copy looked- making me look forward to allotment season and growing my own. I enjoyed this look at how and why we learn to eat what do immensely- the easy to digest anecdotes and case studies bringing the theory to life for me. More than most fiction books I read, I found myself wanting to talk about this book, wanting to call up friends that were pregnant and share the stories. And I realised I wanted to do this in general- I liked learning about sciencey things, and I want to know more. This book has not only changed the way I think about food but also the way I think about books! "
44,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492257-irene,5,"This book was so informative. I'm happy to have discovered another carefully researched and scrupulously put-together book on my favorite topic, food. More importantly, it's about the socialization that happens behind food, starting from our parents, to our siblings, to society, to even ourselves. It's interesting that she chose to present the research as empowering, instead of trapping or oppressing us eaters. It made me think about my own life experiences with food and opened my eyes to considering others' experiences as valid, when I didn't really do that before. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone. Bee Wilson earns a spot on my list of favorite non-fiction food authors, which includes Michael Pollan. I hope to read her other book if the library has it."
45,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326664-alexis,3,"This had a lot of interesting science and history behind how we eat, but unfortunately it was spoiled by a recurring moral undertone. Despite the final ""this is not advice"" list which says food isn't a moral issue (and which also has such gems as ""No one is too busy to cook"") it keeps popping up--particular foods are praised or scorned, referred to as ""real"" foods, and so on. While Wilson may not view food itself as moral, the questions of healthfulness and obesity in particular are viewed through a good/bad lens. It's not simply content to be an impartial view of how we learn to eat, but Wilson sees it as a lens for change."
46,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400971-crystal,4,"A thoughtfully researched book about the way we eat, from how infants are born with blank palates that are also influenced by their mothers' diet and milk, to our childish ingrained preferences for sweet and salty that should develop to enjoying more sour and bitter foods as we age, to the frustration of living with and treating disordered eating. It was careful not to judge, just to present info, but I did like the author's tangents into special food at the end of every chapter. Chocolate is really obviously marketed and branded as a woman's food, men aren't encouraged to eat veggies, and potato chips do have this universal appeal based mostly on the crunch factor, yep, but well-written."
47,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11110209-barbara,4,"This is a very enjoyable nonfiction book about eating. It explores ideas about how we learn to eat, including topics about learning to expand our food choices. It also touches on ideas of moving away from Salt, Sugar, and Fat in favor of healthier choices. There's an nteresting chapter about food/nutrition/weight coaching, pointing out that most food/nutrition/weight coaching fails because the coach simply states uninteresting judgements instead of actually listening to the person seeking food/nutrition/weight advice."
48,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13533930-sarah-wojcik,5,"Cannot recommend this book enough. Reading it as a new mom made certain aspects more significant for me, but I think one could find a wealth of worthy info reading as a picky eater, a person coping with eating issues or even someone who just loves food. This isn't a parenting book, but I have learned so many important ways to ensure my son not just eats healthy and well but that he one day enjoys the true wonder and excitement that is our endless rainbow of sustenance. "
49,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,5,"I liked Wilson's previous book ""Consider the Fork."" This is better. This is outstanding non-fiction writing. It is clear and logical and building on a theme that helps to explain a complex topic of everyday importance. What she says is backed up by the science on behavior change and obesity. Just telling people to eat ""healthy food"" is futile. The approach suggested here is to help people learn about how to enjoy all kinds of foods. "

Use a doll to model trying new foods. Yes, it works...my daughter ate blueberries today as a direct result. But a lot of the book is a well-trod history of nutrition. The strongest paragraphs are the memoir-like ones."
51,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91760-betsy,3,"This book combines history, memoir, and science and explores the importance of culture (both family and otherwise) in our eating habits. More research than I expected, and I had to push through some parts. But I love Wilson's conclusion: that our tastes and food habits CAN change for the better, and over a fairly short period of time. A nice addition to the food literature."
52,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6545002-nick-jj,1,"The beginning of this book is the standard information concerning nutritional information that can be found in the biology and anthropology literature. The rest of the book is a serious of utterly unconvincing arguments that were not well formed. Definitely not worth the time. Read the original academic literature, I promise you it is much more interesting. "
53,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/390396-heather,2,"Meh. No new insights for this avid reader of food/nutrition/newborn issues. Surprisingly lacking in interest.

54,0465064981,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935956-kate,4,"One of the most frustrating and upsetting things for me right now, as a mother, is trying to feed my children. I hate buying marshmallow cereal for breakfast, making PB&J sandwiches for lunch, buying boxes and boxes of chocolate chip granola bars and fruit snacks, and I dread dinner because I know everyone will whine and complain about what is being made and served. I hate knowing I will have to sit and watch my children poke at their plates and tell me they aren't hungry, but then grab a hand full of gold fish crackers thirty minutes later. I also hate seeing their anxiety about the upcoming dinner and watching them try to eat as many snacks as possible since they know they will not be eating any of the food prepared for dinner. I have discussed picky eating with my pediatrician and mothers of more and older children. Everyone has reassured me that this is typical and they will grow out of it. I have been discouraged, stressed, angry, and even afraid watching how little my children eat and the small variety. I struggle because I know their food preferences will not only effect the meals they eat at home, but will also effect them socially when they try to eat at friend's houses, go on dates, or even try to eat with work colleagues. I have struggled trying to know what to do. Since they are so small for their ages, do I give in and make ""special"" meals so they at least eat something? Do I refuse to cater to their demands and make them go hungry if they don't eat? Do I force them to sit at the table until they eat everything on their plate or make them eat the uneaten food at the next meal? Do I let them make their own meals if they refuse to eat what I provide? Do they eat like this because they are super tasters and find it physically impossible to eat certain foods? I have read every article I can find and asked everyone I know for advice, but I have never found the answers I have been looking for. Although I wouldn't say this book solved my problems or gave me all the answers, I feel like this book provided me with the most information and gave me a better understanding of the what is going on with not only my children's relationship with food, but also my own.This book is extremely thorough and covers almost every topic related to our relationships with food. The author discussed historical ""child"" meals, siblings and ""fighting"" over resources, extreme pickiness, hunger versus appetite, food associations, taste familiarity, eating disorders, and lots more. I was so grateful that this book even had a section on super tasters, since I have suspected this might be my son's issue. She had great data and studies to back up her ideas and claims; I loved that this wasn't a mother of 20 who was just telling me how she got all her children to eat. I also appreciated the section about parents (and grandparents) and how they equate feeding and watching their children eat with love and how that gives them a sense of pleasure, and how they often worry about children being underfed or have a desire to ""plump"" them up since historically during times of famine, the heavier children were more likely to survive. She explained why so many children are picky, she gave some ideas about things we can do to help combat pickiness when the children are older, and she also gave two ideas about how to help picky eaters expand their tastes and palettes. I also appreciated the way she approached the mistakes so many parents make. She didn't criticize or condemn. She would often talk about the mistakes she personally made while feeding her own children or she would use data to show that many parents are making the same mistakes. I never felt shamed or judged because of the mistakes I've made. I felt like I was normal and made the same mistakes many parents make. Although I don't have great faith in her suggested methods in helping children expand their food repetoir (the sticker method seem a little juvenile for my son), I appreciated reading about them and now feel like I have a better idea of what does and doesn't work with getting kids to eat disliked foods. I also appreciated her section on anorexia. It made me realize how little I actually knew about the disease and all the misconceptions there are out about the disease. Since I have two daughters, in the back of my mind I have been concerned that I might do or say the wrong things about bodies, fat, or food and ""make"" my daughters anorexic, so I was grateful to gain better knowledge and understanding.I felt like this book was a beacon in the storm for me. For the last seven and a half years, I have felt lost and confused about how to feed my children. I am still in the storm and things are still rough, but for the first time I feel like I better understand my role in helping my children eat. I now know what things I do that are damaging or traumatizing to them and their relationship with food, I realize my children can change their likes and dislikes (they are not permanent or genetic), and I also understand that these things won't get better if I ignore them; they won't just grow out of it. This book isn't strictly about feeding children or dealing with picky eaters, but those were the sections I most appreciated. I feel like this book gave me the answers to the many questions I have been asking for years."

When a reward is offered for performing an activity, that activity is valued less. The child ends up loving sweets more, because they have become a prize"". p 21[Re: Dr Lucy Cooke] ""From four to seven months, it seems that there is a window when humans are extraordinarily receptive to flavor, but by following current guidelines on exclusive breastfeeding, parents tend to miss it. Several studies have shown that when vegetables are introduced at this age, babies are more open-minded."" p 24Tiny tastes system: Parent and child together select a vegetable that the child currently moderately dislikes. Then, each day for 10-14 days, not at dinnertime, you offer the child a pea-sized amount. If they taste or lick it, they get a tick in a box and a sticker. If not, no big deal. p 26[on baby formula being flavored with vanilla - and on how babies are generally open to any flavors] ""Of all the flavors you could think of with which to 'imprint' a child, vanilla is possibly the least useful from a health standpoint"" p 46""When we hear someone suggesting that we stop eating our favorite brand of ice cream or potato chips or sliced white bread, we feel a knee-jerk hostility. It's hard to let go of these foods and find a better way of eating without a sense of loss. The thing you are losing is your own childhood."" p 62""'Kid food' is based on the presumption that children have a natural palate for simple carbohydrates, fat, sugar, and not much else. As we've seen, there is no truth to the idea that children have an innate drive that will automatically make them like hamburgers more than grilled fish or muffins more than fresh berries. But if you eat enough 'kid food' meals as a child, the presumption of limited tastes may become a self-fulfilling prophesy."" p 84""Yet despite their anxiety about candy, parents will happily feed their children highly sweetened sports bars, fruit snacks, and cereals that are candy in all but name. Why is a bowl of frosted cereal loops with added rainbow marshmallows allowed to count as 'breakfast' and not 'candy'?"" p 86""And giving food to calm a distressed child teaches the child that unhappiness is a reason to eat. ... If your mother interpreted all your cries as a cry for food - rather than for play or sleep or a fresh nappy - then it stands to reason you would feel inclined to treat yourself the same way as a grown-up, silencing your sadness with sugar"" p 112""The style of feeding that has been shown to offer the best outcomes for children's health is called 'authoritative'. Such parents are highly 'demanding' that a child should eat well. Yet they are also highly 'responsive' to cues from the child (so no force-feeding or coercion). ... The ideal scenario for a child is to grow up in a house where there isn't too much junk food, but also not too much fuss made about the evils of sugar and fat."" p 120[on Diego, a 9 yo boy who was highly selective about what he ate, turning down party invitations and other events because he knew he wouldn't be able to eat the food] ""Diego's therapists realized they needed to find a new method of treatment that acknowledged just how much food scared him. They helped Diego to give a name to his anxiety: 'Beaster the Worry Wart'. His parents could now tell Diego how sorry they were that Beaster was so hard for him to fight. ... After seven years of cajoling and tears and stress at mealtimes, this new tack must have come as a relief to Diego: now, he and his parents were on the same side in the fight against Beaster. The very next session, a week later, Diego arrived with a list of ten new foods that he had tried spontaneously, including steak and vegetables. Over a period of four months, Diego continued to try new foods, until he reached a point of full recovery. Beaster, he said, had shrunk in size and was no longer so scary."" p 196""Keith Williams's clinic has seen positive results when the novel foods are first offered in an amount as small as a pea, or even as small as a grain of rice. If the food is tiny enough, and offered in structured taste sessions, even autistic children with extreme selective eating have been able to learn to like a wide range of foods, often in less than a week. ... Williams's latest version of taste exposure for selective eaters is called 'Plate A and Plate B'. First, the parent chooses twenty new foods they would like the child to try. Plate A contains three or four new foods chosen from this list of twenty, in pieces no bigger than a grain of rice (maybe carrots, chicken, and oranges). Plate B contains foods that the child already eats without difficulty (let's say Pop-Tarts, cookies, and crackers). The parent gives the child four to six 'Plate A-Plate B' meals a day, each lasting ten minutes (strictly timed with a timer), and no other meals are offered. They tell the child to have one bite from Plate A and then they may have a bite from Plate B and have a drink, 'ignoring crying or refusal.' The child continues to alternate between the plates until the time is up. When a child has learned to eat a food on Plate A for three consecutive meals without crying or gagging, the size is increased from a grain of rice to a pea, then to half a spoonful, and finally a spoonful. By the time a spoonful is accepted, the child has learned to like the Plate A food. The aim is ultimately for as many as possible of the Plate A foods to become Plate B ones: something the child eats willingly and with pleasure. The reason 'Plate A-Plate B can work so well - when strictly applied - is that it places very low demands on the child. When food is as small as a grain of rice, it is almost as if it is not there. The pressure on the child is further reduced by the fact that there are several foods on each plate. If the child really can't stomach two of the foods on Plate A, there is always the third one. Williams says that the reason this simple intervention is successful is that it gives children who cannot bear to taste new foods an opportunity to taste them. It helps them to vault over their own wall of resistance and put the food in their mouths."" p 198-199[on the Sapere movement - a food education program that emphasizes the pleasures of food] ""The results from Jyvaskyla [Finland] were so promising that Sapere was extended across all Finnish preschools. Teachers reported that by including food in the children's education each day, their attitudes towards eating could be radically altered. During the Sapere project, children 'dared to test stranger foods' than before. Parents were surprised to find that their children had acquired new knife skills, more varied tastes, and fresh attitudes. Instead of being disgusted by beets, the children were now fascinated by the question of how they turned the cooking water purple. The children were more conscious of what they ate, and more attuned to whether they were hungry or full. Most strikingly of all, there are hopeful signs that Sapere has led to a reduction in the incidence of child obesity in Jyvaskyla. This happened not through explicit lectures on nutrients, but by channeling the children's natural curiosity. The change was largely unconscious. Arja Lyytikainene, a nutritionist who oversees the Sapere program in Finland, says it is all about 'learning by senses, learning by playing'. Some days, the children might go berry-picking; other times, they make bread, chop fruit for fruit salad, or draw pictures of vegetables. Most of the time, they are hardly aware they are learning at all. Sometimes they play the 'lemon thief game', where one child leaves the room and another child rubs lemon on his or her hands. The 'detective' comes back in and has to say who has been stealing lemons from the garden. Many of the Sapere sessions take the form of open-ended sensory games, where the children describe the sight, taste, and smell of different foods. They discuss whether they prefer to eat carrots raw or cooked; whether they enjoy bread more with garlic, with butter, or plain. In one Sapere session in Jyvaskyla, a child observed that white pepper 'attacks the nose'. Another said that blue cheese was 'soft, white and green... just like a ghost.' In earlier generations, criticizing food like this would have been seen as bad manners. But the prospect of saving a generation of children from bad diets and ill health trumps any niggles over etiquette. The aim of Sapere if to get children to know their own authentic tastes. 'Everyone has his own preferences' is one of the mottos another is, 'Matters of taste are not argued about, but discussed'. The children are encouraged to design their own birthday cakes, including the fillings and decorations they love the best. Like Dympna Pearson, the Sapere teachers in Finland have found that dietary change comes not from forcing people to eat what they do not like, but in helping them to discover their own passions. In a Sapere-run kindergarten, the children have many different tastes. Some prefer blueberries, while others like lingonberries. Some gravitate towards sour; others like saltiness ... all of them end up with a set of taste preferences varied enough to enable them to eat well when they are older."" p 246-247""The first step is seeing that eating is a skill that each of us learns, and that we retain the capacity for learning it, no matter how old we are."" p 248[From the Epilogue: This is not advice]""If it's not a mealtime and you are wondering which of two 'healthy' snacks you should buy, the answer is probably neither""""No one likes waste, but it's time to abandon the idea that it's bad manners to leave food on your plate. What's bad manners is to make someone feel ashamed for leaving food on their plate when they are full.""""Hunger is not always a signal to panic. A day in which you haven't had a couple of spells of feeling slightly peckish is probably - sad to say - a day when you ate too much."""

Wilson argues that how we eat is not something we are born instinctively knowing how to do, but something we learn. Why do some people gorge on rich foods while others are able to eat a modest portion then stop? Why do some people hate anything green while others love Brussels sprouts, celery and zucchini? How do we learn to relate to food in healthy ways?Wilson argues that ""our food habits when we were two - whether we played with our food, how picky we were, the amount of fruit we ate - are a pretty accurate gauge of how we will eat when we are twenty"". So how do we teach children to eat? Exposing children to a wide range of foods, and not mistaking their neophobia - their temporary wariness for the unfamiliar - as something permanent. Wilson urges us to offer new ingredients to children over and over again until they get over their fear and dislike and potentially transform this to enthusiasm. (One tactic she suggests is having the child witness someone else - even a favourite toy - consume the food and enjoy it.) Expose children to new flavours when they are young (i.e. when they are being weaned as six and seven month olds) and more open-minded. Don't limit yourself with the bland, inoffensive tastes like carrot and squash - try stronger flavours like spinach and broccoli as well. Don't bribe children to try new foods as it can make children dislike the new foods more, whilst loving the rewards that come at the end because that is the ultimate prize. Don't believe that food likes and dislikes are immutable and that there is no point trying to change or influence them. Persist and persevere. Wilson comforts us by saying that even if we've missed the ""flavour window"" for babies, it is possible to expand the palate of the older child through tasting sessions outside of meals - offering children pea-sized amounts of different foods to reduce the amount of pressure. ""The parent and child together select a vegetable that the child currently moderately dislikes (as opposed to feeling deeply revolted by). Each day for 10 to 14 days...you offer the child a pea-sized amount.""Given that eating is also a social experience, how we eat is governed not only by what we taste (and smell) but also by our earliest memories of food. So your idea of the perfect mac and cheese might be very different from mine because our mothers had very different versions. The danger is that our earliest food memories might be shaped less by home cooked foods, than by industrially produced snacks and convenience foods. Hot dogs aren't the healthiest foods with all the nitrates in them - but how do you stop eating them when you associate them with the pleasures of your childhood summers?For these reasons, Wilson argues against ""kids' food"" - the unchallenging offerings of fries, burgers, pizzas and nuggets on restaurant menus, colourful sugared confections in cartoon emblazoned packaging, etc. While it might start off as ""something separate and different from normal food"", it makes it harder for people to develop a taste for ""real food"". How our children learn to eat is also shaped by our attitudes when we feed them. Is our philosophy to ""finish everything on your plate"", an attitude that was logical in earlier decades of scarcity but might be less relevant in developed countries where there is a surfeit of food? Wilson advocates for an ""authoritative"" approach to parenting and feeding - where there is high warmth coupled with high demands that the child should eat well (through behaviours like not having unhealthy foods in the house, but also not making too much fuss over the evils of sugar and fat). Remember that being a parent is not just about getting nutrition into your child, but also teaching them to become a ""competent eater"" who will make good decisions about food and eating. (On this note about making good choices, Wilson observes that ""of all the foods that we could give a child free rein over, cereal [like letting them choose whether they want Cheerios or Frosties] makes the least sense. Parents let children choose cereal but dictate which vegetables they eat; it should be the other way around"".)Wilson ends on a positive note with the final chapter on Change, where she reiterates that tastes are not immutable and can be moulded and influenced. The transformation of the Japanese diet and cuisine to the one that we are familiar today - with its emphasis on fresh vegetables, fresh fish and delicate flavours - is a case in point. The Sapere movement is another fascinating initiative. A great read overall, particularly if you're trying to educate a young palate."
