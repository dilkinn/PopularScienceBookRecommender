0,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Ramachandran is as wonderful a writer as he is a brilliant scientist which easy reading of not always simple science. In his book, Phantoms In The Brain: Human Nature And The Architecture Of The Mind, neurologist Ramachandran was more concerned with how the physical brain and what goes wrong with it affects the mind. A very similar field to Oliver Sacks. (They really differ in that Sacks thought of all his patients as people who had an often very interesting disorder. Ramachandran thinks of them as patients!) In this book, he is concerned with how disorders of the person that originate in the brain are related to the physical brain, to the structures of it and how it works. In both books, everything is illustrated with examples of people and their behavioural problems with roots in neurology not psychology. Sometimes the author uses them as a jumping-off point for a lecture on the brain, neurons, the very important but hitherto unknown by me, mirror neurons, our senses and various structures of the brain.One of the most interesting to me because I have experienced it many times in my wonderfully mispent youth (view spoiler)[ not over yet, well the youth is but the 'wonderfully mispending' or I hope not anyway (hide spoiler)] is synesthesia . This is where the senses cross over from the appropriate, like being able to see the colour blue, to the very odd or inappropriate, like also being able to listen to it, feel it, possibly smell it or associate it with a particular number. I experienced it on LSD, everyone on acid did I think, it was one of the reasons to like it so much. I used to listen to music and then watch it unfold, dance in front of me in wonderful colours and patterns. sometimes ribbons in the sky, sometimes in puffs of warm air I could feel. An orange I peeled and ate exploded in my mouth into tiny pinpricks of colours, pure primaries and jewel tones. You never forget it's so extraordinary the sensation of there being an additional sense to the one you expect. These were not hallucinations but sensory experiences.Sometimes though the synesthesia edged off into hallucinations (even more enjoyable). I remember that once the notes of the music got up and formed two tiny armies and marched across the carpet unfurling flags at each other in perfect time to the beat, changing colours like a chameleon keeping time with the bass guitar line. (I was kneeling by the electric fire saluting, I kid you not, kind of taking the march past of these musical note armies).\Ultimately, in the book Ramachandran is on a quest for what makes us human and not like the animals, not one step up from the primates but completely different. What is consciousness and self-awareness, the soul if you like, and where does it lie? In what structure of the brain does it reside in us and no other? Is our humanity, our selfhood, not a sum of how we experience the world and think and dream at night about it? Is it really to be found in a physical structure? Ramachandran's book was a quest to find it and it is a good journey he takes us on, but the end is not in sight."

Some of the concepts teeter on the edge of wild speculation but is cheerfully admitted to be so by the author. Am truly lucky to have an autographed copy of this pathbreaking book. :) Will try to give a longer review with some of the more important points later. Anatomy IS Destiny!"
2,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a brilliant book by a first-rate scientist. Ramachandran has personally made some amazing discoveries in the field of neuroscience. His writing is lucid, and his enthusiastic, personable style makes this an informative, as well as a very entertaining book.Ramachandran's approach is to investigate patients who have had varying degrees and types of brain defects or injuries. These patients acquire abilities or handicaps that Ramachandran interprets and analyzes, in the hope of casting light on the underlying structure of the brain. Some of these handicaps are quite bizarre, for example: blindsight, in which a person has only subconscious ability to see; synesthesia, in which a person sees numbers (or musical notes) in colors; fantom limbs, in which an amputee ""feels"" pain emanating from the missing limb; a condition where a person with partial paralysis vehemently denies that he/she has any problem; and many, many more interesting cases.Ramachandran shows how important mirror neurons are, in making us ""human"". He explains why they evolved in our brains, and how central the feeling of empathy is to human survival. This topic is made exquisitely interesting, by Ramachandran's original analyses and hypotheses. What's more, Ramachandran often proposes experiments that could be used to test his hypotheses. Given enough time, I think that he would personally perform all of these experiments."
3,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,1,"I've never read Ramachandran in long form before, and I don't think I ever will again. This stuff is right up my tree – popular neurology – but . . . no. I started having a sinking feeling at ""Over the years I have worked with hundreds of patients afflicted, though some feel they are blessed, with a great diversity of unusual and curious neurological disorders."" Oh really said my eyebrows, because that could either be a careless turn of phrase, or a blunt dismissal of the social model of disability and the understanding of disability as anything other than a curse. I forged on with an open mind.Spoilers: it was the second one.A few of the lowlights: a lot of clinically accurate yet deeply disturbing discussion of autism in which Ramachandran all but questions the place of autistic people in the human race; repeated descriptions of how brave it is for patients to try to remain happy despite their afflictions (I mean, can you imagine actually being happy with a disability!); an endorsement of Cure Autism Now, which I will put in the correct disability politics context by explaining that my hiss and recoil was exactly the same you'd make if you were a lifelong liberal who discovered the person advising you on political facts was an ardent Tea Partier.So yeah. Really wish I hadn't given him any money."
4,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,2,"I don't really know all that much about neuroscience or the field in general, so please take this review with a grain of salt. I have to say that I was pretty disappointed by The Tell-Tale Brain, which billed itself to be an overview tour of the brain and how it is used to delineate our sense of self. This is primarily achieved by examining brain-based maladies with the thinking that really outlandish and odd neurological conditions can highlight what different parts of the brain are responsible for and how they might work together. This is a sound, logical approach, and some of the conditions hinted at in the introduction were so bizarre that I was readying myself for a wild ride. For the most part, the informational content of the book is sound. Ramachandran is a leader in the field of neuroscience, a giant among his peers and worthy of a lot of the praise he receives for the therapies and intuitions he's developed over the years diagnosing and treating neurological conditions using a Sherlock Holmesian approach. Unfortunately, it seems that a lot of that praise has gone to Dr. Ramachandran's head and he feels compelled to constantly insert his self into the tale in ways that I personally found obtrusive and distracting. I'm willing to concede that maybe I was being really picky and finicky, or that maybe the thought of my vacation's imminent end distracted my with upcoming responsibilities while reading through the book preventing immersion and heightening my focus on words and phrases that jarred. In fact, I'm hoping someone I know will read this and give a second opinion to either tell me I'm crazy or if there's really something there and I'm not just imagining things.Anyway, there were several things that bothered me about this book as a scientific work, even one designed for popular audiences and most of these problems are stylistic. Each chapter is divided into a different aspect of brain function and follows a general problem of examining curious cases of neurological maladies and what it reveals about how our brains work within that process. There are chapters relating to vision and perception, feeling, and consciousness. The approach and format work well and provide interesting stories and one would expect that most of these stories would be from personal experience. Ramachandran gives the impression in almost every single chapter and disease that he was absolutely instrumental in the diagnosis and development of treatment. The general pattern of disease/revelation is followed by a not-so-subtle pattern of ""And that led me to propose in 199X, blah blah blah, which was later confirmed by so-and-so and is now the standard treatment in dealing with blah blah blah disease...."" This latter habit casts the rest of the work in a very poor light to me. It shifts the focus of the book from the evolutionary and functional development of the brain to the achievements of Dr. Ramachandran the Great and Magnificent (and by the way, here's some stuff about the brain that I figured out to sate your curiosity). Am I being unfair? Maybe. Ramachandran is a very well-respected neurologist and a lot of the works he congratulates himself for have been professionally published and reviewed. In short, he deserves the praise - but doing so yourself is really distracting. Perhaps I'm especially cognizant of this self-congratulation because of the volume of scientific memoirs and pop-sci books I consume. True, I usually stick to the physical sciences, but earlier this year I did read The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee and the experience was very different. In Emperor, Mukherjee used case studies to give a personal context to the disease being studied, to bring the science and history of cancer to life. There's a reverence when dealing with the patients that seems befitting and less like they're being used by the author. Dr. Ramachandran seems to do quite the reverse. At times, it feels like his list of patients are rungs on the ladder of achievement and excuses for self-congratulation and personal aggrandizements. Again, Dr. Ramachandran is indeed a renowned neuroscientist with plenty of professional publications and treatment methods ascribed to his name. He has earned bragging rights, but there are whole chapters of this book where he comes across as narcissistic. I've also read Einstein and Feynman in their own words, pivotal figures in the development of physics and wonderful people to boot. Their works are personal yet filled with humility and almost never bespeak their personal achievements. If you didn't know what they achieved before picking up their autobiographies, you wouldn't really have any idea about them after, even when they were talking about developments in their respective fields to lay audiences. Ramachandran's style was just a major turn-off to me.The second major problem I had was probably more the fault of the editors of the work. Ramachandran has a rather annoying habit of giving asides that come across as flippant or pedantic. He includes references to other fields and terminology or to literary works not because they elucidate some principle he's discussing, but because it makes him look smart. Or at least that's the way I read it. Here's an example:""Note that the fusiform area itself mainly performs a dry classification of objects: It discriminates Ps from Qs, hawks from handsaws, and Joe from Jane, but it does not assign significance to any of them. Its role is analogous to that of a shell collector (conchologist) or a butterfly collector (lepidopterist), who classifies and labels hundreds of specimens into discrete nonoverlapping conceptual bins without necessarily knowing (or caring) anything else about them.""Again, call me picky. Both of these are good analogies, however it seems redundant and almsot braggadocious (boastful) to give the jargon once you've already made the point. Either use conchologist and lepidopterist and expect your audience to know what you mean or just stick with shell collector and butterfly collector and move on. Doing otherwise makes it appear that you're showing off your fancy lexicon like you're trying out for Jeopardy or something. One instance may be forgiven, but the redundant use of these parentheticals continues throughout the work. As an editor, I'd have eliminated them. The last problem I had (again, stylistically) was the inclusion of dialogue in significant portions of the book. Certainly, science writers make use of occasional bits of dialogue and quotation in their works, Mukherjee does this in Emperor of all Maladies, but these instances are usually well-contained and brief or are extracted from recordings or interviews. Ramachandran seems to re-invent whole passages of conversations from 15 years ago right down to the jokes he used and the responses he's gotten. Either his memory is incredible or he's just making them up to suit the point he's trying to make, usually points that are already well-made by their invocation in the narrative. The following example was from the early part of the chapter on synesthesia:Certain otherwise normal people claim they see sounds, or that certain numbers always evoke certain colors,” we told the class. “If any one of you experiences this, please raise your hands.”To our disappointment, not a single hand went up. But later that day, as I was chatting with Ed in my office, two students knocked on the door. One of them, Susan, had striking blue eyes, streaks of red dye in her blonde ringlets, a silver ring in her belly button and an enormous skateboard. She said to us, “I’m one of those people you talked about in class, Dr. Ramachandran. I didn’t raise my hand because I didn’t want people to think I was weird or something. I didn’t even know that there were others like me or that the condition had a name.""Ed and I looked at each other, pleasantly surprised. We asked the other student to come back later, and waved Susan into a chair. She leaned the skateboard against the wall and sat down.“How long have you experienced this?” I asked.“Oh, from early childhood. But I didn’t really pay much attention to it at that time, I suppose. But then it gradually dawned on me that it was really odd, and I didn’t discuss it with anyone…I didn’t want people thinking I was crazy or something. Until you mentioned it in class, I didn’t know that it had a name. What did you call it, syn…es…something that rhymes with anesthesia?”“It’s called synesthesia,” I said. “Susan, I want you to describe your experiences to me in detail. Our lab has a special interest in it. What exactly do you experience?”“When I see certain numbers, I always see specific colors. The number 5 is always a specific shade of dull red, 3 is blue, 7 is bright blood red, 8 is yellow, and 9 is chartreuse.”I grabbed a felt pen and pad that were on the table and drew a big 7.“What do you see?”“Well, it’s not a very clean 7. But it looks red…I told you that.”“Now I want you to think carefully before you answer this question. Do you actually see the red? Or does it just make you think of red or make you visualize red…like a memory image. For example, when I hear the word ‘Cinderella,’ I think of a young girl or of pumpkins or coaches. Is it like that? Or do you literally see the color?”“That’s a tough one. It’s something I have often asked myself. I guess I do really see it. That number you drew looks distinctly red to me. But I can also see that it’s really black—or I should say, I know it’s black. So in some sense it is a memory image of sorts…I must be seeing it in my mind’s eye or something. But it certainly doesn’t feel like that. It feels like I am actually seeing it. It’s very hard to describe, Doctor.”“You are doing very well, Susan. You are a good observer and that makes everything you say valuable.”The dialogue to me is just a huge distraction and deviation from the otherwise scientific tone of the work in general and don't do well to personalize the condition (as I'm sure was the intention) - especially that bit about Susan mispronouncing synesthesia. To sum up, The Tell Tale Brain does contain some really good information and the sections where the information is presented without commentary work really well. I liked the detective-like approach to making inferences and assumptions about how the brain functions and I liked Ramachandran's overall approach toward psychology, Freudian psychology specifically, and his attempt to enhance those fields with a brain-based physiological understanding of certain common disorders like anxiety and depersonalization. I also liked that he made it a point to highlight areas for future research and to make clear to the reader when he was straying into the realms of speculation. Overall, there were just too many narrative and stylistic distractions for me to fully appreciate the science going on here. If you're interested in neuroscience, I have no alternatives to suggest since I'm rather new to the field myself, but give it a shot anyway. It's comprehensive and maybe I am just crazy. Let me know."
5,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13073887-catherine,5,"Brilliant books as expected from the prestigious reviews seen on its cover. It's a book about various aspects of human brain functions, explained in lay language, but without compromising the quality of the information. A case study illustrates the issue at the start of each chapter, then the chapter goes into explaining what is known about the issue - but the author is a researcher and a clinician and this book goes far beyond just describing the state of the art. Many new hypotheses are presented and the author discusses them in all honesty, presenting the evidence indicating that these hypotheses are plausible and presenting also the possible experiments that could be done in the future to support the hypotheses.I particularly enjoyed the parts dealing with mirror neurons, intropspection and evolution of langage. I truly learned a lot. I have been a researcher in psycholinguistics for about 6 years in the past (about 8 years ago) and I have never come accross such a good synthesis of the main issues and main hypotheses on the topic of the evolution of language - of course a lot more could be written but it's an excellent read and the author has brilliant new ideas on this topic... like on many others. The author has been compared to a new Marco Polo. Yes indeed, fantastic journey! "
6,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I have to emotionally review this book and then write a response to another reviewer. AMAZING! So fun, so many good facts and brain candy. I love how out of so many things that we consider ""disorders"" we can piece together ourselves in our many arrayed fashion and find similarities and Synesthesia? What who ever heard of people responding to number-color categories in the fashion fabulous! So many interesting and intriguing case studies. Our mind is so variable and so fragile, we are all humble creatures with the minds to see ourselves withing the universe. How unique how beautiful! Now I want to respond to a number of reviewers who have commented that his tone in this work made it seem as if our brain capacity is at such a higher level as to make us the pinnacle of the evolutionary tree. I completely agree that this is not the case and I must say that yes the author did come across in this manner and that it is disappointing from an evolutionary view to have the author jummp to this conclusion. I first realized that we are certainly not the pinnacle of anything when viewing and learning about the life cycle of moss in my biology class and finding out that they live a large diplontic phase, instead of the traditional haploid/diploid phases of plants which makes them very unique indeed and in their own way the pinnacle of their kind. This only shows me that there is no pinnacle, there is no such thing. We can never have a diplontic life cycle we are not built to and in this way moss is superior to us if we want to apport superiority. In addition we can never gather our own energy from light as many plants do and in this way they too are superior to us. We do have a fascinating brain though and interesting capacities in our own right, and while I must say to the author that I think he made a mistake in treating us as the pinnacle, I do think our intellectual capacities should be expounded and celebrated and that we should search for new insights into this vastly interesting world we call neuroscience and consciousness. In this regard the book is fabulous and he did an excellent job of conveying some of the uniqueness of the mind. "
7,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14767901-martha-love,5,"Ramachandran explores through fascinating case story telling and research data the mysteries of the human brain. His examples of brain memory are an eye opener and give a new perspective on how we view the dynamics of consciousness and health issues related to brain defects and injuries. I am most grateful after reading his book to finally understand why people feel pain in their stomach first when they have appendicitis (just one of those mysteries in life I always wondered about). Although quite technical, I found this to be one of the most informative books in brain science that I have read.Martha Love, Author of What's Behind Your Belly Button? A Psychological Perspective of the Intelligence of Human Nature and Gut Instinct andIncreasing Intuitional Intelligence: How the Awareness of Instinctual Gut Feelings Fosters Human Learning, Intuition, and Longevity"
8,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8092361-laurie-graham,1,"This book repeats a lot of stuff that's in Phantoms in the Brain so I regard it as a rip-off. Read one or the other but you don't need to read both. I also found the way Ramachandran's politics and his antipathy to religion intrude into his neuroscience quite obnoxious. He seems to be winking at the reader and saying 'you and me, we're Democrats, right? We're smarter and saner than guys like Dick Cheney.'This kind of thing is insulting to people who've ponied up 15 dollars for his book but may not share his opinions. He should confine himself to the neuroscience, which is, needless to say, very interesting. "
9,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,3,"I deeply respect Ramachandran and I believe his unique ""Holmesian"" approach to research is an invaluable benefit to a field that risks moving at a snail's pace, possibly backwards, in it's quest to functionally image everything to death. So many of his far flung hunches have proven correct, and many of his random ideas have fuelled entire directions in research. I absolutely admire him.That being said, I was unimpressed with this book. It felt disjointed and repetitive, swinging wildly from one fascinating patient to the next in anecdotal abandon, reiterating everything Ramachandran has said in previous books and trying to tie it all together with a flimsy theme, so broad you could make a case that every psychological observation fits into it. Falsifiability is an important (the most important?) aspect of science, and while the individual lines of inquiry the author proposes are certainly falsifiable, his overarching theme of human uniqueness is not-- though it may seem counterintuitive, a theory that can be reshaped ad-hoc to explain every observation is NOT a good theory.I still generally enjoyed the read, I just expected better from someone so simultaneously avant-garde and anachronistic in his approach to science. Better editing may have helped tighten it (and fix the typos and grammatical failures). In particular, the last paragraph of the book is a throwaway attempt at a conclusion that, instead of concluding the contents of the book, actually introduces an entirely new topic without getting into any of the serious discussion it warrants. It's jarring, overpersonal and aggressive, misplaced as the concluding statement to a fairly cool and objective read.Despite its fragmentary feel, there are plenty of tidbits of information, countless ideas for new research, and a few interesting ""big questions"" to ponder. Ramachandran is an amazing scientist, and generally a great writer, but I think he tried too hard to make this one BIG and ended up doing the science in it a slight injustice. The field in which he works is an absolutely engrossing one, really in its infancy and ripe for exploration in every direction; I understand his intention in this book was to underline that point and offer a multitude of broad speculative ideas that could lead to new discoveries, but in the process I think he lost some of the framing that holds the science together. As Ramachandran himself states in the book, good science is a meeting of vague hunches and rigorous experimentation; I expected a bit more of the latter from him, but still appreciated the ride offered by the former."
10,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,1,"Ramachandran's description of the physical operation of the brain and its various maladies is probably all good stuff, but his cheerleading for human separateness and his writing about the conscious brain as if that were ""the"" brain gets in the way with what could be a good book. The author's theme is human uniqueness. As all species are unique, Ramachandran is really talking about human exceptionalism in life's grand scheme. Humans are special in ways that other life forms are not. He does this by emphasizing our obvious cognitive ability to transcend the here and now and to do all of the special things our conscious brain can do. In a matter of fact sort of way, he sets up his argument for human specialness by identifying those unique human capacities that other life forms don't have. That seems like an unfair way to argue. He says an eagle can't read newsprint. That's Ramachandran's standard, but why is that a higher standard than an eagle flying and reading the landscape below for prey unaided by machines? Once you get into implied standards of what's higher and lower, you evaluate by some standard. By the standard of evolutionary success, cockroaches have been around a long time and might long outlive us and have the last laugh (even though as Ramachandran points out only humans can laugh).The book also almost screams out, ""where is Freud in all of this?"" Not specifically Freud, but the unconscious and, for that matter, all of those evolutionary drives that direct our brain in ways that we are, at most, only faintly aware. Can we really understand the brain without touching on these deeper undercurrents? On that side of things, Ramachandran is almost silent. For him, even though he says he comes at his topic from an evolutionary development perspective, the brain just operates, without energy, without fears and passions. Consciousness is our unique trait relative to other life, but how does this give us an accurate picture of the brain in the absence of those evolutionary motivations that make us tick and make our brains operate the way they do. Sure, we can decipher the world of quantum physics with our sophisticated capacity for abstract thought but that same brain can use such knowledge to destroy life through nuclear warfare. Does the human brain operate on its own, as a human head with no body, or does that brain reflect and serve its ancient heritage of fear and hatred, of we-versus-they tribalism, of desire for domination and rank? If cognitive neuroscience can't go here, it should at least acknowledge its limitation as opposed to claiming the field.Clearly, we can agree with Ramachandran that we are ""no mere ape,"" but have we really left most of the ape behind? Intentionally or not, he articulates a view that we are the charioteers in charge of our animal nature, but there's a substantial body of evidence that has it the other way around. In that view, our uniqueness is not our consciousness per se, but in a consciousness that expresses and serves our animal impulses, for good or bad. This is where a Darwin and Demasio perspective about our continuity with other life forms might give us a fuller picture of who we are and what our brains are about. "
11,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6960931-andrew,3,"I read Dr. Ramachandran's previous book, Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind, as an undergraduate in an artificial intelligence class. The book was a complete paradigm shift in my worldview. It was the first time I'd heard anyone explain with such clarity all that modern neuroscience had uncovered and aspired to learn.Now a decade later, I was intrigued to see how far Ramachandran had progressed. In The Tell-Tale Brain, I was happy to find that his passionate, inquisitive, quirky personality is still in full force. One does get the impression that he's a person who truly has never ""worked"" a day in his life, because he loves his job so much. I was slightly disappointed that the first third of the book was largely a recap of his previous work (much of which was covered in Phantoms).The most exciting section of book deals with mirror neurons. It has been discovered that neurons in the brain will fire not only when performing an action like picking up a cup. They will also fire when you watch another person pick up a cup. Sensory neurons override the signals in the brain so we don't accidentally think we are actually picking up the cup also when we watching. It's a remarkable discovery to know that our brains essentially have an empathetic component hardwired into them. It's not hard to imagine how these type of mechanics could be the underpinning of our entire emotional and social experience.The final third of the book feels much like a call to action for the new generation of neurologists. He postulates on dozens of theories regarding the physiological roots of everything from thinking to our appreciation of art. While interesting, because these ideas are primarily theoretical, for lay-person like myself it lacked the impact of the previous sections where Ramachandran is describing the results of his actual research.However, I did find his investigation into the location of the self-awareness in the brain quite interesting. The following quote gives a good synopsis: ""The conscious self is not some sort of 'kernel' or concentrated essence that inhabits a special throne at the center of the neural labyrinth, but neither is it a property of the whole brain. Instead, the self seems to emerge from a relatively small cluster of brain areas that are linked into an amazingly powerful network.""I would highly recommend that anyone interested in Ramachandran's work listen to his 1993 BBC Reith Lecture entitled ""The Emerging Mind"". He is an absolutely unique personality, and hearing him describe his research in his own voice lends a whole new dimension to the experience."
12,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5372117-aravind-p,4,"Mirror neurons are simply fascinating. Going 4000 years back, closeness of all the early inventions like the invention of wheel, fire, self-awareness, civilization etc had always baffled the scientific world as to what made them wait for 3000 years to make the first civilization or discovery of mind and gods, in spite of having the same brain formation. What the recent studies have indicated is that at that point of time something evolved in brain which didn’t exist for other animals, something that helped humans to learn and understand things and eventually evolve from a simple animal into a complex personality, a bunch of neurons that apparently has an ability to empathize and emulate from its surroundings as opposed to the basic motor neurons(the one that works on command from senses).Mirror neurons form a cluster of neurons sitting on the front lobe of the brain. What it does is, it tries to mirror the events that it ‘sees’. For instance, if you are pinched on your hand you would instantly know the pain, which is quite natural as there is physical connection between the skin and the brain. But a similar emotional pain is felt when you see someone else being pinched, in a way you tend to empathize with that person. But what tells you that it is painful?. When we see someone cry a similar emotional thing tries to send us to the same state of despair, why? Ramachandran tells how the discovery of mirror neurons gave the neurologists an answer to all these questions.Getting back to the evolution of human beings, the formation of mirror facilitated the Lamarckian evolution, named after Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. While Darwinian theory was slow and involved physical transformation, Lamarckian was quick and evolved brain instead of physique. The example he quoted was, for a Polar bear it must have taken about 1000s of years to evolve itself with the thick white coat to survive in the polar region – this is the Darwinian evolution. A boy learns by watching his father kill that polar bear, skin it and use that fluffy coat to survive in the polar region, in a matter of 10 minutes – that is the Lamarckian evolution. There is a saying in Malayalam “kaateethu kaatunnavan kurangan”(the one who imitate others are monkeys), one must have heard it while trying to imitate another person. And not just that, the elders amongst the children often get caned for showing all bad habits to youngsters to imitate. Damn it mirror neurons!The mirror neurons are quick in capturing the ‘characteristic images’ in the brain and is quick in reproducing it later, it appears. How it works is, say we see one person getting beaten up. The brain gets a signal from mirror neurons telling that getting beaten up on arm is painful (as if it is his/her hand that is getting thrashed), the brain tries to verify that with the nerves from the arm and finds that it is not true. Then a cancellation signal goes and cancels the physical pain ‘application’, but it cannot cancel the emotional bit of the pain. So when we see someone beating a kid, we don’t feel the physical pain but we do feel the emotional pain(empathy). The interesting thing is, when the arm of this person is paralyzed or amputated there is no nerves connecting the arm with brain. Hence at that stage the brain cannot cross check the genuineness of the pain. Upon experimentation, what the neurologists have found is that people with such syndromes can even feel the physical pain. So which means if you try to pinch your arm in front of another person who doesn’t have that arm he feels the exact physical and emotional pain that you just felt, in his phantom arm!!. This is used by neurologists and physiotherapists to cure ‘learnt paralysis’ - A person sitting opposite to the patient massages or exercise his own hand, the patient in turn gets the real feel of the massage and eventually gets cured.He points out the formation of civilization and its development by accounting it under the development of mirror neurons. How a person become insensitive after being tortured for a while, how a child learns about smoking by just seeing from his/her parent, despite of many no-smoking signs etc implies the significance of understanding the surroundings a key to human development. What this implies is that of all the senses, the brain uses visual signals as primary. He also narrates about some of his patients who have had the visual connection severed, unable to identify his mother but at the same time he knows the fact that it is his mother. So, he is deluded that that person is an imposter who looks like his mother! That emotional connection being dis-functional. I may need to re-read the bits around languages though. This book covers what makes us to be like a human. He also tells us varied syndromes and abnormalities of brain which may bridge the neurology and psychiatry studies, one of the important one being autism which primarily is due to disfunctional mirror neurons."
13,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"I was prepared to dislike this book. Ramachandran goes to great length to emphacize the uniqueness that separates humans from animals – an argument often misappropriated by those who countenance the inhumane treatment of animals. He also seeks explanations in evolutionary biology. I tend to associate this with the popular oversimplification that we perceive symmetrical faces as attractive because our brains see symmetry as a marker for healthiness and therefore a better gene pool for offspring. In addition, Ramachandran deluges the reader with a chapter on neuroanatomy that is a dense atlas of Latin terms. Fortunately, the author's personality rebuffs these doubts. For one thing, he has a slyly geeky sense of humor. He relates being awakened in the wee hours of the morning by a lawyer who wants him to testify in a lawsuit. The client supposedly is suffering from Capgras Syndrome and cannot recognize his wife. Ramachandran quips that the man is actually reaping a benefit. She will always be a novelty to him, and that should enhance her sexual attraction! He apologizes to the reader for a joke that might be construed as in bad taste – but then goes on to marshal a final volley of scientific data!On the serious side, Ramachandran opens up a view of true scientific inquiry. In his discussion of synesthesia, he iterates over 10 tests that are performed to ascertain not only the reality of the phenomenon, but its various aspects. The prolific questions that spring to his mind, as well as his patience in devising tests, are truly astonishing. Moving from the “what,” he then forms some hypotheses about “how.” This is where the neuroscience begins. An extensive break-down of the components of vision (color, object identification, perception of motion, affective associations, distance – he alludes to over 30 different pathways) are integrated by the brain. The theory outlines a possible cross-wiring or leakage between the channels of color and number recognition which are located next to each other in the brain. Ramachandran then indulges in some philosophical speculation. There is some evidence of a link between synesthesia and creativity. Part of the art of writing is the ability to conjure up unusual and compelling metaphors. Perhaps all of us are to some degree synesthetes in the sense that we have the capacity to understand and appreciate metaphor as well as broader aesthetic principles. This is part of the “why” section of his inquiry. Later in the book, he returns to the theme of connections between neurological evidence and the development of culture.The book covers Phantom Limb syndrome of amputees, Synesthesia, Autism, Language and Aesthetics. Along the way, it describes mirror neurons, brain circuits that entail constant feedback loops and complex integration of information. Evolution, as well, is not oversimplified in Ramachandran's world. Nature is a master at recycling old parts to perform new functions. As an example, Ramachandran describes how the multi-hinged jaw of reptiles was transformed into components of the ear that enable us to hear air-born sound rather than ground-transmitted vibrations.This is a difficult book that does not stint on the science. I only began to appreciate how much Ramachandran had simplified when I started looking up some of the afflictions on the internet. I found the chapters on Language and Aesthetics overly speculative, and the writing lacking in literary flair. What Ramachandran does offer is an honest approach to the interrogations of science – interrogations that involve not just questions, but imagination."
14,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5813283-rohini,5,"The Tell-Tale Brain: a story that leaves nothing unimagined yet a lot to comprehend about this enigmatic 3-pound jelly residing within us. This is the second book of an Indian author that I cherished reading in past few months. The author takes you on a roller coaster ride in trying to unravel the mysteries of the mind, the last chapter being a peep hole into countless maladies that one can encounter with it. A must-read for all those intrigued by the powers of the brain and its careful delegation of physical and metaphysical role in making us a unique creation of nature."
15,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"There's a ton here. The first half of the book covers a lot that's pretty well discussed elsewhere, but in the second half, Ramachandran just explodes into a huge fireball of ideas that are expansive not only in their reach but are also impressive in their novelty and creativity. You get the feeling that the only thing keeping him back is time. It's definitely not a lack of important questions and well-designed experiments.I especially liked his discussion of art and aesthetics and his speculations on why we like abstract art and what makes some art almost irresistible to the human brain. He comes to it with a refreshingly different perspective due to his Indian background. He's unwaveringly scientific, but seems to have a much greater pool of examples to draw from due to the vast cultural landscape India offers. A lot of the book is speculative, but the speculation isn't far-fetched, certainly nowhere near as speculative as most of what today's physicists write about, and he clearly indicates what's solid and what's remains to be tested, often suggesting experiments for others to try."

Some parts were really interesting like the chapters about aesthetics, language and the various case studies, but a lot of it was repeating stories and theories from his first book. I also found his writing to be too self-aggrandising-especially in the latter half of the book. His opinions seem to take over the book with no concrete basis and i found myself disagreeing with some of his 'theories' and the way he went about explaining them.He undermines linguists and psychologists-and basically anyone who isn't a neurologist.I felt like someone told him he needed to write another book, and he was struggling to come with novel ideas to write about that have proven research findings, so he just ended up writing about his opinions on various pathways of the brain."

18,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41905173-essam-munir,4,I've been introduced to the field of neurology/neuroscience by Ramachandran and his amazing cases.This book summarizes what Ramachadran has done till now and his great innovative way of thinking.
19,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"In The Tell-Tale Brain, V. S. Ramachandran addresses the question of what makes human beings different from all other animals. Of course, the culprit is the brain. Thinking, beating, beating…whoops, that’s Poe.The author is at the forefront of neuroscience; the book describes the current state of the art, which is not as far advanced as some other sciences. In the epilogue, he compares it to the stage of chemistry in the nineteenth century, “discovering the basic elements, grouping them into categories, and studying their interactions. We are still grouping our way toward the equivalent of the periodic table but are not anywhere near atomic theory.”This book goes into detail on some of those elements and their interactions. Mirror neurons fire not just when you do something, but when you see someone else do it. Googling mirror neurons, I find that the interpretation of what they do is highly controversial. But Ramachandran makes a good case for them being important in human social behavior. Then there are areas in the brain that determine body image and map how the body relates to the space and objects around it. I just read a book by a psychiatrist (The Naked Lady Who Stood on Her Head by Gary Small) in which he relates a case of a man who felt like his arm didn’t belong there and who had a fairly strong desire to have it amputated. Dr. Small of course looked at it as more of a psychological problem, though he balked at a Freudian interpretation. Ramachandran postulates convincingly that this problem is caused by defective cells in the area of the brain that controls the arm part of body image. In other parts of the book, he discusses many aspects of language, the senses, and consciousness.I give the book five stars because it is full of fascinating concepts, many of them new in the last ten or fifteen years. Yet I have problems with the basic thesis that humans are unique among animals because we are so much smarter, we have language, and we have consciousness of self. It’s unarguable that we are unique; we’ve populated the planet and filled it with our structures (and trash). I love thinking and reading and all kinds of human stuff. But Ramachandran’s viewpoint, and that of most of his fellow scientists, seems rather, well, speciesist. He obviously considers humans to be superior to and more important than any other species because of our differences. This kind of thinking holds us separate from that ecosystem, and I disagree. We have crowded those other species out of most of the planet; our effect on the ecosystem has been devastating. I also am appalled to see him casually mention research in which the researchers observed (using electrodes) how monkey brain cells fired under various circumstances. Yikes! These are the people who torture and murder monkeys and other animals. My beliefs go against animal research (yes, I’m vegetarian too). (And I’m trying not to get recursive about how Ramachandran’s theories might predict or explain my viewpoint.) Some of Ramachandran’s speculations will undoubtedly turn out to be true. Many of them won’t. In particular, many of the ideas in the chapter about art seem silly to me, and my guess is that in fifty years they will look as archaic as the idea of phlogiston does now. This doesn't take away from the quality of the book, as he emphasizes how speculative it all is. The book is full of concepts that I found exciting and stimulating, and I highly recommend it."

For all practical purposes, most English speakers have a vocabulary of about ten thousand words (although you can get by with far fewer if you are a surfer).
This quote. This quote right here. It isn't even his first unexplainable jab at surfers, mind you. Is it supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to let the author's character shine through?But at least that's largely harmless, as are his overwrought metaphors and his frequent bouts of self-aggrandizingly tooting his own horn. His frequent overuse of technical details is also a choice I can understand - not one I like, since the topic is too foreign for me to remember lobes and cyngulates without taking notes, but one he does announce from the get-go as an antidote to dumbing down the text.But then there are his jokey-jokes about how ""human females are said to be sexually available all the time but that's never happened to me, hardy-har-har"", his contrast of autistic and ""normal"" children, and his description of transgender people as having a disorder which, ""bizarrely"", they don't want cured. It's hard to believe this book is only 7 years old, 'cause this stuff did NOT age well. There's good content in there, no doubt about it. But too many things about the presentation made me unable to access it. Pity."
21,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,4,"After seeing him speak on a TED talk, I was curious to read his latest book. He's made his complicated field accessible and overall I found it entertaining and thought provoking. As he states, neurology is a field that's rapidly changing, we learn more each day, and what he presents here is a work in progress and certainly not the final word. But as neurology can explain questions that have long perplexed us, it seems well worth it to learn from an expert how much more we've already been able to understand already (and how far we have to go). I especially liked the chapter on autism. On the negative, I didn't enjoy the meander towards the end on art and thought these chapters felt disjointed from the rest of the book. Throughout, he made interjections that I think he thought would lighten the tone...but seemed to be irrelevant and detract from the point. Not his fault, but reading this on the Kindle meant that the illustrations were hard to decipher. Overall, anyone can get something out of this book. And I suspect that now that I've read it, I'll get more out of other articles or books dealing with some of the subjects he discusses and be happy to have a deeper understanding. "
22,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4201815-kevin,5,"Another stunning science-for-you book, this time about neurology, the study of how the brain works. Author starts off with a promising premise: he will explain how we are not merely descended from the apes, but something more. Our brains have evolved to much higher levels of complexity and abstraction, and he recites the well-known (to science) experiments to demonstrate just exactly what is going on in your brain today, and then suggests why we have developed this way. He gets to the fundamentals of ""thinking"" and ""seeing"" -- what are they physiologically?. His investigation into ""synaethesia"" -- where some people experience different numbers in different colors, or music, or experience different textures as different emotions (eg sadness, etc) is amazing (and obviousy memorable)! Human beings have 30 different areas of the brain involved in seeing, all adaptive traits beyond chimpanzees. There is an area of the human brain responsible for abstracting ""garden things"" from the perception of a hoe, a rake, and a shovel. It's not just that we can count, but that we recognize the abstraction of ""quantity"". That's just the first 2 chapters. This is the real thing."
23,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,4,"An interesting book that might well be 5 stars if I hadn't recently read Ramachandran's earlier book, Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind. Dr. Ramachandran recycles a number of themes and examples from that book. He does add some interesting speculations on what makes art, especially Indian art, appealing so well worth reading even if you have read his earlier works. "
24,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9530007-ajay,5,"Mindblowing book.

27,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2335215-theresa,4,Heard about V.S. Ramachandran through watching his stuff on PBS. His speaking and writing are both very engaging! 
28,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,5,"A brain injury patient simultaneously becomes demented and develops a previously unwitnessed artistic talent. Another patient’s brain lights up identically when seeing another person being poked as it does when he, himself, is prodded. An amputee brushed on a specific area of the cheek has a sensation in a specific area of the lost limb—i.e. phantom limb sensations can be mapped to points on the face. A stroke victim develops “metaphor blindness,” and suddenly “the 800 pound gorilla” becomes an actual gorilla. A test subject’s right angular gyrus has an electrical charge delivered to it through an electrode and the person has an instantaneous out-of-body experience. There are temporal lobe epilepsy patients who literally feel one with other people—or, in some cases, the natural world in general. These are just a few of the fascinating cases that Dr. Ramachandran presents in “The Tell-Tale Brain.” Many of these phenomena would have once been attributed to purely psychological or spiritual causes, but now their biological origins in the brain are being revealed. Dr. Ramachandran is a neuroscientist whose claim to fame is making a noteworthy contribution to our understanding of the brain using mostly low-tech and non-invasive experiments with subjects who have brain abnormalities or injuries. Before there was EEG (electroencephalogram) and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines, much of what scientists learned about the brain came from determining what capabilities were lost (or, occasionally, gained) by patients who had specific brain damage. In this way, we gained a great deal of insight into what areas of the brain are responsible for what tasks and we’ve learned that many aspects of the mind that were largely thought to be beyond biology are—in fact--not. It’s fascinating to see what bizarre effects can result from brain damage or abnormalities, from people who think they are dead to others who want to have a limb amputated because it doesn’t feel like it belongs to them to yet others who think their loved ones are imposters. The central question addressed by this book is best summarized by a quote from the book’s introduction: “Are we merely chimps with a software upgrade?” Ramachandran proposes that any answer to this question that can be scientifically investigated must reside in the brain. Most of our organs and our general structure are not that different from those of our primate brethren. But our brains are infinitely more capable than those of other species. In responding to the question, Ramachandran considers the brain’s role in topics like language, aesthetics, and belief that are the sole domain of Homo sapiens. One of the most interesting discussions is how our brains fill in the blanks and a give meaning to what we see, such that we sometimes find signs in random data streams. The final chapter deals with introspection and how we come to define ourselves by what we think and what we feel and here Ramachandran gets into some of the most fascinating conditions mentioned in the book, such as Cotard Syndrome in which subjects firmly believe that they don’t exist. There are a few topics that he delves into in particularly deep detail. One of these topics is that of mirror neurons. These neurons are integral to our relationships with others and are essential to our ability to learn. They fire in mimicry of movement (e.g. facial expressions) we see others perform. The author also uses his work with phantom limbs and synesthesia to illuminate the workings of the brain. Phantom limbs occur when an amputee can still feel sensations in the amputated limb. While phantom limbs were at one time believed to be residue of the soul or the like, studies have offered insights into its origins in the brain. Synesthesia is when the brain is mis-wired such that there is a blending of the senses. As an example, a person might see a different color associated with each musical note or with each number. Synesthesia was once considered a delusion and people were institutionalized for this cross-wiring of the brain. Autism is also addressed in a chapter, and-in particular—the theory that this affliction may be linked to the mirror neurons. I found this book to be fascinating and insightful. While it delves into our tremendously complex brains, it does so in a readable and comprehensible manner. The fact that Ramachandran’s focus is largely on low-tech and relatively simple experiments means that one can readily understand them in a manner that one might not with studies based on fMRIs or EEGs. I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in the magnificent human brain."
29,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7551285-marcelo-bahia,5,"I couldn't wait further to get more of this. When I love a book as much as I loved Phantoms In The Brain and realize the author has other ones on the same subject, I usually let the dust settle before reading them. In this case I couldn't: after reading an investing book for some variety, I picked up The Tell-Tale Brain immediately.I'm glad I did. While Phantoms In The Brain was published in 1998 and had a lot of untested hypotheses throughout the text, The Tell-Tale Brain is a 2011 book revealing a more mature scientist and writer who goes even deeper in the mysteries of the brain and mind.The core of what makes Ramachandran so pleasant to read is still there: the bizarre neurological cases and the elegant and easy to grasp explanations for them, the witty humor (he now reveals an accentuated annoyance with Californian surfers), Shakespearean quotes, the link between neurology and philosophy, among others (still, no Rush lyrics yet).Of course 13 additional years of experience and experiments make a difference in a field where we know so little and growth has been exponential. The experiments are more sophisticated and the harder discussions are tackled more frequently with neurology weapons instead of philosophical artillery. That's the kind of science I prefer: let's see what's actually going on with neurons inside our brains while the philosophical discussions about consciousness remain too hard. As Ramachandran shows, recent discoveries are indeed showing us important clues about the long sought consciousness problem (but no solution yet, sorry).If I list here all the phenomena he deals with in the book, you'll want to read it right away. Examples are why phantom limbs are common among amputees, why we laugh and why the smile is an universal greeting gesture, how language evolved, what could be behind autism, the role of our mirror neurons in a diverse set of instances (heck, I thought I knew a lot about mirror neurons, but then Ramachandran showed me the light), why we are wired to find beauty in the world and in the arts and what seem to be the laws behind our beauty sensor and, of course, he concludes with a grand neurological tour on consciousness, self-awareness and free will. This last theme is also the last one in Phantoms In The Brain, but the approach is much more pragmatic and tied to scientific method experiments than before, like in other sections of the book.The ingenious experiments the author devises hold an important lesson: even very difficult hypothesis can be tested if you think and work hard enough. What the hell, the guy is able to do an experiment proving the existence of our innate love for art! As a financial market professional, this is a concept I try very hard to inculcate among my business partners. This is akin to the lesson brought by the excellent statistics-driven How To Measure Anything, one of my all-time favorites.Now I have to promise myself I won't read additional Ramachandran books for a while, and that will be hard."
30,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,4,"*This is your brain on evolution* In _The Tell-Tale Brain_, V.S. Ramachandran impressively tells the tale of the evolution of the human brain. In his own words:""This book is my modest contribution to the grand attempt to crack the code of the human brain, with its myriad connections and modules that make it infinitely more enigmatic that any Enigma machine."" (p. xv)In his attempt to illuminate the brain-mind-body connection, he tackles such mind-boggling questions as:*How do we perceive the world?*What is the so-called mind-body connection?*What determines your sexual identity?*What is consciousness?*What goes wrong in autism?*How can we account for all of those mysterious faculties that are so quintessentially human, such as art, language, metaphor, creativity, self-awareness, and even religious sensibilities? (p. xi)A common thread to the answers to all of these question is the premise that many of the traits that make us uniquely human--and not ""just"" another series of primate--have evolved through the novel development of brain structures that had previously evolved for other functions. Key players shaping the course of our evolutionary and cultural development are plasticity and mirror neurons, which have allowed for the brain of an ape ""to evolve such a godlike array of mental abilities."" (p. xi)In the first part of the book, Ramachandran helps us understand the unique inner workings of the ""normal"" brain by presenting cases of abnormal brain wiring: here, patients with phantoms limbs, synesthesia, and autism provide clues to brain plasticity, connectivity, and mirror neurons, respectively. He provides a fascinating exploration of mirror neurons--""the neurons the shaped civilization""--and illuminates how they underly many of our uniquely human abilities, including empathy and language. Next, he looks at ""the artful brain"" and proposes his nine laws of aesthetics: grouping, peak shift, contrast, isolation, peekaboo, abhorrence of coincidences, orderliness, symmetry, and metaphor. In the final part of the book, he tackles the nature of self-awareness, and defines the seven factors necessary for a cohesive sense of self--unity continuity, embodiment, privacy, social embedding, free will and self awareness--and explores cases of patients who have disturbances in various aspects of their sense of self.In the process of giving us a tour of the brain, Ramachandran also provides peeks into his own thought processes. As other reviewers have noted, at times his comments can be a bit off-color and politically incorrect, and his content can be free-flowing and speculative. But, if you have an open mind and a sense of humor, these reveals can add to the richness and color of the book. He is only human after all."

Apart from being extremely informative in unfolding the mystries of the Brain, its also easy on some one like me who is from a non medical background. Ive never come across a non fiction work that too on science as exciting as a hard core thriller. Ramchandran can surely try his hand at creative writing, as his propensity for humour, apt metaphors and lucid style makes one wonder if had also majored in literaure or craetive writing.This work would inspire the book worms to get lost for quite a good time into the books that are written on the unfathomable wonders of human anatomy, brain in particular. Would like to reproduce an excerpt from the book, which was right in the beginning ; so tha one get an idea of what is the journey like on to the next 400 odd pages..For the past quarter century I have had the marvellous privilige of being able to work in the emerging field of cogmitive neuroscience. This book is a distillation of a large chunk of my life's work, which has been to unravel- strand by elusive strand- the mysterious connections between brain, mind and body. In the chapters ahead I recounnt the investigations of various aspects of our inner mental life that we are naturally curious about. How do we perceive the world? What is so called the mind body connection? What determines your sexual identity? Waht is consciousness? What goes wron in autism? How can we account for all tjose mysterious faculies that ate so quintessentially human, such as art, language, metaphor, creativity, self awareness, and even ligious sensibilities?

It lays out information in a clear and understandable mix of readability and scientific/clinical jargon.There is a lot about mirror-neurons and how they influence so much and the brain and thus, so much of what makes us human.I like that in his prose he takes such care to explain not just his theory but the methodology to get there. The tone is very light and casual but fitting the text. It is more anecdotal than I am used to in my medical non-fiction, but more often then not I found it interesting and relatable so no complaints from me.The way the autism is described and explaned is in such a way I have never heard or understood before. It is pretty mind blowing but rational and so simple. It really opens you up to how amazing an organ the brain really is.The last half of the book questions art and hypotheses on how and why we appreciate it. It is very interesting. The analogies to keep it in context always illuminate the text.This book comes recommended to anyone with even a slight curiosity of what it means to be human... by which I mean, everyone!"

The mind is a wonderful thing to understand and this book goes a long way in helping me understand it.The author has one of the best droll sense of humors I have ever come across while listening and he made me laugh out loud multiple times. The narrator really knew how to add the proper amount of drollness and added to the experience.This is one of the few books where I lost something by listening instead of reading. I would get confused when he talked about some of the illustrations of the optical illusions under discussion and when he talks and names different areas of the brain, I would get lost and forget which region does what. Overall, even if I had read the book with the maps of the brain, I wouldn't have followed the names of the regions of the brain, but be warned, it does get very confusing while listening. "

This looks like a poor and in some way a rather premature attempt to live up to the standard set by Phantoms. The various patients he discusses are startling yet interesting in a very inhuman kind of way. I was taken aback by one by his statements in the book when he ""hopes to see such a patient one day"" with a certain neurological disorder, I know he may not have meant it that way but it came out quite badly. Also his insistence on explaining everything via evolution gets tiring after some time. It becomes too easy. You get up to a tight spot in trying to make sense of a neurological disorder and he suddenly says, ""ah, I know, its because of evolution!"". Like evolution is the new name for God, an invisible almost personified replacement for God which is more scientifically acceptable.His reasoning of the male attraction to a woman's breasts due to the monkey's attraction to plump ripe fruits is particularly distasteful.

35,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11166290-bob-gustafson,4,"I am a Ramachandran fan to begin with. This book is not quite as good as ""Phantoms in the Brain"", but does earn four stars. ""Phantoms"" was two parts science to one part speculation. ""Tell-Tale"" is one part science to two parts speculation. I am prejudiced in favor of the former.For those not familiar with Ramachandran, he is a neuroscientist who examines unusual people for the sake of finding what may be true of larger populations. He presents what he finds out about the unusual and then speculates what this may mean for others.I opened ""Phantoms"" years ago because of my own disability, but any reader who has a casual interest in how the brain works can enjoy what Ramachandran has to say, even if you disagree with him. (I disagree with his speculation on aesthetics.)Buy this book and read it. you won't regret it."

With a concoction of theories about self (almost like answering what constitutes the I), using the study of bewildering psycho/psychic anomalies/abilities of various patients, the book, while proving that man is not merely an ape, is difficult to read but no less intriguing and interesting than a Sherlock Holmes' mystery! VSR tries to create a wholesome picture from various parts into the workings of the genius called brain with a narration that not only kindles the interest but also stupefies the reader. He also provides amazing insights into the probable root causes of various ""under-research"" mental disabilities. All this finally results in creating in the reader a totally new sense of our own distinct self!"

Ramachandran does a wonderful job of first placing our understanding of the brain within the broader world of scientific inquiry and his desire for simple, elegant experiments feels almost magical in a time of big data focused science. The stories he uses to elaborate various brain functions are well used and so his occasional tongue and cheek criticisms of previous theories. I walked away with a new found appreciation for the unknown world of brain processes and their potential accessibility via non-expensive scientific inquires. Concepts that I walked way with - Mirror Neurons, Autism, metaphor construction/function, the use of evolutionary theory in brain science and the grand hope that within my life time we might figure out how this intricate system that holds the seat of consciousness and ""humaness"" works at a nitty gritty level.

'A brief tour of human consciousness', I was a bit disappointed with first half of this book -- the content fit the general theme, however it all felt like only an incremental addition to already established concepts of phantom limbs, synaesthesia, mirror neurons etc. So, if you are in the same boat as me - don't despair; hold on to this gem. Because what's in second half is a fresh perspective on language and art and brain's role in it all.Neuroscience is an inherently interesting subject. It's in that nascent stage where every piece you touch is waiting to unravel its secrets. But ironically it's also an area which is garbled with way too much jargon which can act as a barrier for a layperson. Not with VSR's writing style though. He's witty, he's profound, he's top-notch!"

The final chapter wrapped everything up by delving into consciousness and self awareness. It was interesting reading about all of the different disorders and how complex the brain is. I have had a deep fascination with the machinations of the brain for many, many years. Although this book answered several questions I had, I feel as though I have even more questions now because of it. But that's what learning is all about. Having preconceived ideas, gaining knowledge, and then questioning your beliefs. I first discovered Ramachadran from the movie ""What The Bleep Do We Know"", and he is a wise and brilliant neuroscientist. I condone him for pursuing a subject that could possibly never have answers. I definitely recommend this book to anyone with an unquenchable curiousity!"
40,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541111-sasha,4,"Ramachandran's synthesis of experiments, case studies, humor and philosophical questions makes this an accessible read for non-scientists. There are insightful applications of neuroscience to art, language, and to what makes us unique as humans. I still think Oliver Sacks is the master of weaving together neuroscience and narrative, but Ramachandran put his own detective-like stamp on the subject matter. There is an appalling amount of grammatical and spelling errors throughout, which makes me grimace at the lack of editing; so while I wasn't being distracted by lack of punctuation here and there, the content of the book was very enjoyable and thought-provoking."

I didn't appreciate his snarky, condescending comments about Christians, Republicans, and basically anyone who doesn't fall in line with all of his opinions, either. BUT he does describe some fascinating phenomena, and the description of mirror neurons and how they contribute to a sense of self (and how a lack of them may contribute to autism)was very interesting.

This books will change our perspective of how a blackbox like brain works. A lot of phenomenon (psychiatric diseases as well metaphysical questions like the nature of consciousness) are explained in pure neuroscience. A lot of his theories are speculative and not tested widely. But his approach seems to be more intuitive than traditional psychiatry which explains everything with psychical terms like intent, repression, etc., This book suggests the unthinkable - that the human mind and nature can entirely be explained in future by means of electrons transmitted through the brain's neural networks.

I absolutely loved that book - there were so many new ideas presented. That book also scored high on readibility. ""The tell-tale brain"" is also brilliant, certainly, but I found it boring. The rating reflects the fact that I wasn't mesmerized more than the conent. There weren't many ""OMG"" moments. V.S. Ramachandran's wants to prove with this book that we are not just another ape, that we are fundamentally different and unique. He does succeed in that and I have as a result revised my view of the human animal."

I assume a lot of the questions / cases covered in this book are something every curious mind would have pondered on atleast once, and learning exactly how these things might happen in your brain is exhilarating. Also it gives you a new perspective to see the world , the humans and their complex brains and how unique it is compared to other animals. Definitely recommend this book for any curious mind."

49,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4,"A rare work of erudition that elevates man out of the company of apes and establishes his uniqueness among all life forms, yet having solid foundation on true science.V S Ramachandran is a distinguished professor and neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. He is best known for his experiments in behavioural neurology and has been called a latter-day Marco Polo by Richard Dawkins. He is a renowned author on neuroscience and is a recipient of India’s third-highest civilian award and honorific title: the Padma bhushan. In this book, Ramachandran narrates literally what goes on in the brain in our everyday lives. With inputs from his vast clinical experience, he tells about what goes wrong in the case of peculiar disorders of the brain. He does it in a careful way as to be comprehensible to lay readers, while at the same time not going down too low as to feel pedantic for those who have background knowledge. One fact that is clearly visible throughout the treatise is the amount of knowledge, or lack of it, that is accumulated over the years in the field. A neurologist is a person who can claim ignorance of many areas coming under his field of specialization, but can still get away with it. The purpose of the book is to expose the uniqueness of man among planetary life. Man owes his special status to his brain. Readers with special interest in the field will find this book to be of immense use in pursuing their aim further, while others get a sense of wonder at the literally mind-boggling aspects of the brain.All books on the popular science genre treats man only as an advanced ape. Mere ape, as Ramachandran remarks sarcastically. The reason behind this forced mediocrity is that the creationists are breathing down their necks, constantly on the lookout for a slip of the tongue or an expression of wonder at man’s special powers which will then be blown out of all proportions as evidence for the biblical claim that God created man in his own likeness. That’s why popular authors invariably trumpeted man’s similarities with other apes at the risk of downplaying his unique characteristics. Ramachandran does a fine job of dispelling the notion of man’s humble pedigree. He takes the bull by its horns and categorically declare that man is unique and special. This book is a glorious narrative of the organ that makes man so outstanding – the brain. But he achieves this feat not by philosophical arguments alone. Quite fitting for a neuroscientist, he lists out several areas of the brain which are found only in humans. The Wernicke’s Area is seven times larger in man than in chimpanzees, which caters for comprehension of meaning and semantics of language. Similarly, the angular gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus are uniquely human (don’t ask me what they are, but the author knows it best). The greatest advantage of this book is its sole reliance on evolution as the route through which these peculiar features came to reside in our brains. It is often suggested that around 150,000 years ago, the human species’ speech and language skills experienced an explosive surge forward. Development of culture, civilization and science is rooted on this remarkable change which took place at that time. How can evolution, which operates through minor changes in each generation account for this sudden explosion of creativity? This is a tricky question, as even a tiny misstep or faltering would be construed as phenomena that can’t be explained by science by that horde of propagandists who go by the name of creationists or intelligent designers. Ramachandran states that even with minuscule amounts of change per generation, when these are accumulated in sufficient quantity to tilt a hypothetical balance in a new direction, such a rapid change is termed a ‘phase transition’. This defined a new paradigm that ushered in a strange new world that man ascended the ladder of progress with each passing generation until at last he wielded the power to destroy his own species.‘Publish or Perish’ is a dictum ruling over the lives of research scholars. Even though this strictly means publication in peer-reviewed journals, catering to the general public doesn’t do any harm if the author is honest and the results genuine. Charlatans often bypass the peer review process and dive straight to the common pool where they can maintain a semblance of authenticity to their ideas which might not have any anchoring on facts. But Ramachandran is different and the pet ideas that are spawned from his painstaking research are presented in a lucid way. Synaesthesia, the peculiar disorder in which a person sees colour associated with a number, sound or even an abstract concept is the author’s favourite. Some people visualize numbers with a colour tinged with it. Curiously, this disorder is said to be more pronounced in people having a strong bent to creativity, like artists, poets, or painters. The author has done extensive analyses of this trait and presents the results in a very simple way. It turns out that in those people’s brains, the areas that are responsible for differentiating numbers and colours have heavy crosswiring of neurons. These areas are adjacent too, resulting in cross talk between the regions and generating the illusion of seeing colour when it really is not there.Language and art are exclusively human. No other animal has come anywhere near us in sharing these wonderful traits. Naturally this calls for the attention of neuroscientists to explain why. The author earmarks several chapters to illustrate his hypotheses and the logical conclusions that can be drawn from them. Readers readily agree with the propositions that are consistent and plausible. However, repeatability and falsifiability are two prime requirements for any scientific theory to hold its ground. The sample sizes of many of the tests actually conducted are very small, you can count them with the fingers of your hands! How can a theory be extrapolated for global significance when the number of people who had undergone testing is infinitesimally small? The author is not at fault here, as the disorder and its symptoms are so rare that it may take a lifetime of observation to arrive at a decent number of volunteers ready to undergo the rigorous examination. But when we move on to the realm of art, we get an impression that the narration is highly speculative and subjective. Ramachandran adores ancient Indian temple art and comes up with theories that purportedly prove that the abstract notions of aesthetics embedded in those sculptures follow universal rules of art propounded by the author himself. Educated Indians, who are otherwise normal, sometimes harbour illusions about the country’s great past that was imagined to be thriving with scientific knowledge and technological innovations that the West could catch up only in the post-Renaissance era. It is to be doubted that Ramachandran also entertains some minor illusions regarding ancient temple art – on a strict historical sense, his example sculptures are medieval rather than ancient, coming from the Late Chola and Khajuraho periods. In addition to the small number of test subjects, the results seem to be biased somewhat. A sketch of a prancing horse is shown on page 310 that are produced by a normal child, an autistic child and the great Leonardo da Vinci himself. It can be easily seen that the figure drawn by the normal child is very bland and hideous, while the picture made by the child with autism comes very close to the graphical richness attested by da Vinci’s. Then he goes on to argue that autism dulls many of the brain areas that control social interactions, but at the same time may enhance the regions dealing with art. This seems like jumping to conclusions, or at least may be thought of as not proved by the examples cited. How can you conclude that all normal children would draw in such an uninspired way or that all autistic children would come up with prized art?The book is very stimulating and easily readable in the first half of it, but not particularly so in the second. While the author has maintained the right balance between hard to grasp neurological terms in the earlier half, he has shed all such inhibitions of keeping a check on outlandish names later on in the book. The most trying chapter is the last one, of course. However, the narrative is very witty and some of it very pointed indeed. The text eminently does its duty to grab the attention of its readers. Illustrating important concepts with the help of case studies is a potent combination to guarantee readers’ interest riveting on to it. There is a fine glossary and an extensive index which is grouped according to topic and we sometimes find it to be not much useful for looking up a word in a hurry.The book is highly recommended."

Some parts will offend liberal feminists (but then, what doesnt?) and some will offend those who belive that culture determines our nature. But Ramachandran has backed with research with not just theoretical claims, but with strong evidence as well. He places several interesting hypotheses, especially on questions of the Self and art, whose validity may be explored further in the near future. Importantly for psychoanalysts, this book of neuroscience provides validation of quite a few Freudian theories. Anyone who wants to know about how their most important organ functions must read The Tell-Tale Brain."

Neurology being his specialty area, Ramachandran has penned a brilliant analytical exposition on what makes us human. In the bargain, he elucidates the working of the brain. With case studies and insights from them. We are in the 19 th century progress level (of chemistry) when it comes to knowing ourselves. But the future appears bright with major inroads being made on the discovery of the powers of the brain and therefore I expect that we keep improving the understanding of the self in the near future.

I did not dislike it and actually found it quite interesting, but the author seemed to be quite full of himself (sometimes facts and speculation were not clearly distinguished from one another and thus he presented his theories as more plausible than they seemed to me). Also, his humour is exhausting (he actually acknowledges this, which made me laugh a lot) and so is the fact that he clearly imagined a heterosexual male reader. Nevertheless, I learned some things and really enjoyed the first half of the book. "
56,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,4,"A thoroughly engaging, enlivening, even entrancing study of neurological research by a leader in the field--with a couple peculiar omissions and fixations.Ramachandran's work has had both theoretical and practical ramifications in neuroscience. His intuitive experiments in working with brain-damaged patients who suffer from a wide variety of often peculiar ailments have led to both a deeper understanding of brain function and clinical relief from such ailments as ""phantom pain"" from missing limbs (his use of mirrors for phantom-pain treatment even appeared in an episode of ""House"").His written approach is direct, personal and appealing. Some have complained of his gratuitous and sometimes raucous sense of humor, but for anyone who has read Indian literature in English, this is simply how most Indian writers approach their work. Live with it if (like me) you enjoy such stuff, or otherwise ignore it and charge ahead to the facts and speculations.Two, to me, broad caveats, though. First, Ramachandran is strangely obsessed with proving that the human brain, in its construction and interconnections, makes people demonstrably alone in the line of animal evolution. His recurring mantra about the ""unique"" aspect of human cognition seems, first of all, unnecessary and intrusive and, second, makes broad assumptions about animal intelligence and function that, so far as I know, have never been tested. I don't get the feeling that the man has ever had a pet or carefully examined animal behavior. And birds' brains, as one example, work very differently from hominids'.Second, though he spends a great deal of time discussng ""mirror neurons"" (motor areas of the brain which activate while watching someone else perform an action), he gives no more than 4 pages to memory, and that 3/4 of the way through. True, this is not a book about memory, but if you're talking about 'intention"" and triggered imitation, how can you totally ignore the existence or function of memory?Still, this is a remarkable piece of work: open, accepting, willing to look at almost all aspects of physical and biological science that can impinge on his area of specialization. There's a heck of a lot to think about here, especially in his conjectures about the development/function of aesthetics (in visual art) and—his special concern—the origins of the internal idea of ""self."" He's especially good at carefully explaining what he's describing, rather than tossing blind terms around. A fine piece of work."
57,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11353425-jeremy,4,"I liked this book in spite of its structure. I learned some really interesting ideas about how our brains work, and the anecdotes about real patients, in the vein of Oliver Sacks, were also interesting. It read like a rambling conversation, but you still learn a lot from it.This book is titled, ""The Tell-Take Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for what makes us Human."" I wouldn't say there's much of a quest for anything here, or even a conclusion about what makes us human. The chapters are arranged in the following way: phantom limbs, seeing vs knowing, synesthesia, ""the neurons that shaped civilization,"" autism, the evolution of language, two chapters on aesthetics, and introspection. Some chapters (seeing vs knowing, introspection) taught me a lot about how our brains do a lot of different things that give us a singular experience of consciousness. Other chapters (autism, the evolution of language) are purely theories on the topic, which are given no supporting data and don't contribute to the flow of the book. They seems like well thought out theories, but still they're theories. And others still (synesthesia) don't really say anything at all. The writer tries to bookend the whole thing by talking about themes, but really, there is none.The author also spends a bit of time propping up his own discoveries, and making it clear that he prefers Indian culture more than western culture. A little strange and unnecessary. But I read the whole book and I was very interested in what I learned. I've read many neuroscience books and I would recommend this over many others. It's just that several of the chapters seem like random digressions, and then they don't even have a point. It's like you've sat down with the author and had a discussion that takes so many digressions and some just don't have conclusions. You still walk away thinking you had a fascinating conversation."
58,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"First reaction after closing the book was to start again, against difficulties to fall in love with neuroanatomy. I hope it’s not disrespectful to draw the line of reference, but the alpha & omega, the lecturer of all lecturers for me is prof. Steven Strogatz and last time I heard the !AHA! bell in my head was when finished with his book “Sync”. “The Tell-Tale Brain” was the next to reach and rang this bell. The reader will enjoy the tale that is behind AHA!, and I’d not to immerse more deeply to avoid readers deprivation from a great sensation related to term that Dr. Ramachandran is calling !AHA! To solve mysteries of everyday life is one of the main tasks of our brains. Successfully solving these tasks is an imperative, it is a matter of Death or Life, and for normal person it’s very much trivial assuming the person is not exposed to war conditions or other hazards. But, the reader embarked on “The Tell-Tale Brain” will soon have to admit that there is a twilight zone of human mind that is so bizarre that will in a fracture of second cause goose bumps of the highest intensity. For that purpose author will introduce disorders that will make you turn around your axis. Yet, I must emphasize, this book is not about neuropsychiatric disorders! No matter to what extent is the evolution incomprehensible for our linear minds, I clearly felt that the author made it to I stop many times during the read and to turn my head behind, into the deep past, and to gaze with the eyes wide open across the darkness of millions of years trying to grasp the term of sudden qualitative change called a phase transitions - the very moments, key points of the evolutionary past, when incremental changes stopped having incremental effects!I’m going to leave the future reader with one of most exciting quotes from Dr. Ramachandran’s book: “How very odd that when your lover smiles at you, she is in fact half-baring her canines, reminding you of her bestial origins.”"
59,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Reading about the mysteries of the brain and recent attempts to unravel them provides a fascinating look into 'raw' science. There is much to learn from the established theories of science and how they came to have their authority, however, we usually only get to hear about them after the fact. Neurology has only scratched the surface of how the brain works, so the intuition, creativity and surprises emerging from new discoveries and those yet to be figured out are 'out there' to be enjoyed. The author of this book, allows this excitement to come to the fore, displaying a willingness to speculate to begin the hypothesis forming process, rather than keeping potentially zany or wrong ideas within to protect pride, reputation, etc.Most of the discussion describes how the study of mental disorders reveal how the brain works, and in turn how humans are the special, unique perhaps, beings that we are. Plasticity, perception (visual), synesthesia are areas I've read about previously, but still found fresh, particularly in the light of human uniqueness. The role of mirror neurons on empathy, autism and language was new to me - they are not unique to humans but seem to be uniquely developed in our species. A final stab is taken at self consciousness and (visual) art/beauty. These last two are especially speculative but I found the rules of aesthetics made sense both in terms of my own (limited) experience of art, and in terms of the biological explanations for their existence. The rules also seemed to have analogy with oral perception (ie what makes music different from noise), but I'd need to check this again to be sure. Self awareness stuff was ok but a bit more vague to me.Overall, the authors stories and arguments are told with wit and personality, and although the brain anatomy is still a little daunting for me, most of the book is pretty accessible."
60,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,4,"Why I Like the Storytelling of ScienceI wanted to know how the world works and whether there was any meaning or purpose in the universe, but I was unsatisfied by the explanations given by philosophy, religion, and received wisdom; the stories were obviously made up in the absence of evidence, some of them to the point of absurdity. Yet, to me, science meant no more than taking math and physics classes and odors and explosions issuing from the chemistry lab. I didn't have much interest in it. I thought I was alone in these thoughts until a few years ago when, triggered by my conversations with a science-denying christian fundamentalist, I began to rethink science. Through reading I gained an understanding and appreciation of the scientific method and critical thinking. Nothing people make up about how the world works matches nature's storytelling. Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won't Go Away, that empirical science is ""that ingenious arrangement whereby reality is afforded the opportunity to answer us back."" I am unable to engage in the doublethink religious belief demands. I need an internal coherence and narrative that matches what my senses tell me. That's why I like reading about science. My ReviewSomewhere recently I came across the term ""fancy that"" to describe science books for general readership. This is one of those. I wouldn't be able to comprehend the studies Ramachandran publishes in peer reviewed journals. Here he simplifies his research and speculation for people like me. Though an entire thesis -- or two -- could be written on the subject matter of each chapter, and though sometimes it is oversimplified (what kind of brain scan was used in a certain instance and how reliable was it?), I enjoyed reading the book and ruminating on its many insights."
61,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409682-oscar,5,"V. S. Ramachandran’s book provides an enlightening and philosophical discussion regarding certain aspects regarding the human brain. He often takes a philosophical approach regarding what makes us human, that is, in regards of what the human brain does, such as develop a sense of self, structure language, enjoy art, among other things that other species are unable to do. Such philosophical discussion, however, serve as a means for the book to delve into discussions regarding how science has explained these things and how the brain and its different components are responsible for several of our cognitive abilities that make us human. Ramachandran also makes great use of discoveries resulting from certain illnesses such as phantom limbs, synesthesia, autism, among other issues in order to show how studying these cognitive issues have resulted in a greater understanding regarding how the brain processes everything from sight, language, meaning, to physical touch. What made this book so enjoyable for me besides the fact that it provides solid and accessible information regarding different aspects of the brain is Ramachandran’s ability to connect the different discussions within the underlying theme that the evolution of the brain and its processes have made us human and have allowed the species to reach the point that we are in. Ramachandran also exhibits a great deal of enthusiasm and as such looks to address just how much we still have to learn about the human brain, which will result in exciting discoveries. Ramachandran also makes it clear when he is speculating regarding issues that are still unclear, but his speculation is sincere, thoughtful, and provides much food for thought that can only lead to further research, discoveries, and yes, more questions. "
62,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,4,"Breezy, fun, and very insightful tour of new discoveries in neurology, with an Oliver Sacks-ian focus on interesting neurological disorders, and on mirror neurons. Ramachandran writes (and thinks) in an affable, optimistic, folksy way. This would sound annoying in a pure pop-science writer, but Ramachandran is an experienced researcher, and his examples and explanations have that quality of instant clarification. In a single throwaway remark, he can open a very wide door of interest. (Would watching a horror movie stop a panic attack? Are puns the opposite of metaphors?)One slightly unfortunate side effect of his casual, playful tone is that he often reaches for humor—which is fine in itself, but his jokes are quite bad. They're grade-A uncle-joke material, corny and slightly inappropriate in a way that makes you want to go ""yeeeah we don't say that anymore"". Ramachandran isn't quite as caring and sensitive as Sacks in his attitude toward his patients, but he seems sensitive enough that I'm sure he's a nice dude. I just wish he'd lay off the wonky jokes.Another slightly problematic area is his attempt at analysis of the building blocks of art and art appreciation. He ties them to basic aspects of visual processing: symmetry, contrast, etc. and some higher-level stuff (metaphor). This is all fine, and I'm in agreement; however, he stops a bit short, only noting in passing other qualities of art (such as ego and social effects). This is partly due to a focus on visual art; true, we humans are visual creatures, but not exclusively so. It could be neat if Ramachandran approached music and literature with the same neurologically-minded mind. Like 'Musicophilia', but a bit more academically strict.It's a very fun book to power through, and I'm looking forward to more."
63,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"On the plus side: this is a very readable, digestible, entertaining introduction to neuroscience, with clear explanation of the functions of various brain bits and good diagrams (worth viewing on a decent colour screen if you are reading the ebook) feeding into the author's enthused speculations. It's very speculative, but this is speculation done right, where it is easy to distinguish between accepted science and the author's sometimes wild musings and what-if and doesn-t-this-suggest ideas.On the minus side - the casual sexism, and stereotype racial humour get annoying real quick. While this is mostly kept separate from the science, the lewd comments about women left me wondering what kind of atmosphere women working with Ramachandran get to deal with.At times it can be hard to tell what is supposed to be taken seriously and what is purely joke. On one level this seems deliberate - it contributes to the speculative and kinda joy-in-science feel Ramachandran is going for, but it can trample over the feelings of patients and just, well, gets irritating. And then there is the Freud obsession, which gets old real quick.On the substance - much of the book discusses mirror neurons, and speculation as to their role. Others discuss what might be behind human appreciation for art (particularly, well, ambitious in scope those two chapters). Ramachandran's structure is more or less to introduce the basic neurological concepts needed to understand his theories, then to leap into maybe-this? territory, spelling out what he thinks might be an explanation. It's easy to follow, clear and moves at a breakneck pace. It's not the only neuroscience book I'd want to read, but it is a good start."
64,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/333860-marissa-morrison,5,"This isn't just a book about the brain. It's also about the scientific process and the joy of discovery. In his preface, Ramachandran explains how axolotls drew him toward science at an early age (this grabbed my attention when I read it, since I'd seen axolotls myself at a museum that morning), and in the epilogue he slams creationists for closing off scientific inquiry. In between, he presents many different aspects of his research, guiding the reader through the scientific process as he followed it in each case--including the many questions that are left open in his mind.There is a ton of amazing new information here on such topics as mirror neurons (which fire on seeing someone else feel something just as the neurons would if you yourself felt it; in amputees, whose limbs cannot send back the ""it's not my arm feeling this stimulus"" signal, seeing someone else's arm get touched can make them feel as though their phantom limb is actually being touched), autism (which seems to be at least partly a failure of mirror neurons to react), and synaesthesia (which Ramachandran discovered to be the result of hazy boundaries between different sections of the brain; most interesting were the patient who is color blind yet sees all the colors with numbers and the fact that people with synaesthesia are more likely than the rest of us to be artists--presumably because metaphor comes more naturally to them). This book is quite enjoyable, thanks to Ramachandran's human narrative voice (he, for instance, remarks how a female research subject's belly tattoo distracted him) combined with his straightforward way of explaining technical aspects of the brain."
65,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1518458-anupriya,5,"Whoa! Ramchandran has his own style of taking neuroscience out of its box and demonstrating its relevance to all our lives in an accessible and familiar way. This book is a fascinating journey into exploring what makes our brain so complex. He goes about describing not only the mechanism of brain functions such as those vision, language, recognizing faces etc but also key features of human consciousness. The book, rich in case studies of VSR’s patients, is a thoroughly enjoyable read making you feel as if it’s a suspense thriller as you reveal mystery after mystery carefully hidden in each page. Real life examples, anecdotes and dialogues give the much needed personal touch making this non-fiction seem very interesting and engrossing. VSR leads you across a fascinating landscape with the skill of a well traveled expert guiding you through the Amazonian rain-forest and also tells you that there is much of the forest that remains unexplored. Makes you want to come back the next time to see if he has discovered something new and fascinating. There is not a single dull moment in the entire book as the author’s experiences keep you glued to it making you curious. Having read it and enjoyed it too, I still cannot say confidently that I now know why we are the way we are. Sure it has opened up some pleasant and some unpleasant secrets. But then I guess that is where the beauty lies. In knowing and yet not knowing some-things, in understanding yet no understanding the obvious and in feeling yet not feeling what is visible. :) Highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to take a plunge into the unknown! "
66,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This would have been more novel if I hadn’t read Ramachandran’s other books. He repeats some of his prior works and theories in this book, but in a new light and with a different purpose. The intention here is not just explaining how the brain works, but how it makes us human: language, aesthetics, consciousness, the idea of a self, free will, etc. The introduction to the book is great. He presents a superb case that we’re not just apes, as it has become fashionable to say among the scientists and philosophers with a materialistic worldview. We are indeed special and godlike. Then the books moves to show how our godlikeness is achieved by our brain. Neuroscience is still in its infancy, especially when it comes to explaining such difficult subjects as consciousness and self and free will, and there are a lot of unknowns and a lot of speculations, but it doesn’t make the book any less fascinating. Ramachandran lives and works in San Diego, and he likes to poke fun at the locals, especially the surfer dudes. When asked about the absurd but persistently popular claim that we use only ten percent of our brain capacity, he said: Well, it certainly seems to be the case here in California. He also seems to like to inject his politics in a science book. When mentioning folie à deux (or induced delusional disorder, a psychiatric syndrome in which two people share each other’s madness), he cited Bush and Cheney as examples. And: What’s the difference between a Democrat and a Republican, other than IQ? Not that I disagree, but I’m just saying."
67,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15711448-mike-owens,4,"Ramachandran is uniquely qualified to tackle this very difficult and intricate subject. He is Distinguished Professor in the Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at U. Cal., San Diego. He has a previous book, Phantoms in the Brain. As the author points out, much of what we know about the human brain has been learned by what is disrupted after traumatic insult to that organ, such as vascular accidents or trauma. Only the development of more sophisticated imaging technology have we begun to appreciate the myriad of connections between the various areas, and we're apparently just beginning to scratch the surface of what must be the most complex organ in the body. Of particular interest to this reader is the section on ""mirror neurons,"" a set of neurons that fire not only when we perform an action, but also when we see someone else perform that same action. This allows us to imitate the actions of others and clearly plays a significant role in our socialization.The book is written in a conversational style that makes a difficult topic accessible to most readers, although I doubt that terms such as anosognosia or apotenophilia will stick with most of us for very long. The book has an excellent glossary and index sections which are very helpful.The only gripe I have with the work is the gratuitous inclusion of political references that the author includes to make clinical points. The author's political leanings have zero interest for this reader and only serve to interrupt the flow of the narrative."
68,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2210010-jessica,5,"I love this book. I really like this author. He has a way of writing so that a) it's not boring, and b) it's accessible to non-neuroscientists. I like science and understanding how things work, but I have a really hard time reading non-fiction books, even when it's on a topic I enjoy. I think it's because they don't engage my imagination, so I don't get lost in them like I do fiction, so it requires more concentration, so I'm more easily distracted, etc. Not Ramachandran's books. I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. I think it really helps that he kicks off almost every chapter with a case study. These are usually deeply fascinating displays of things Gone Wrong in the brain. Then he starts explaining them, and explaining what he thinks is happening in the brain, and showing how he does experiments to prove or disprove his theories. It's technical, but it feels like reading a story. There were even a few places where I was able to guess where he was going next, or what experiment might work and what it would show, which made me feel REALLY smart.But even when he's in story-telling mode, he doesn't pull the technical punches. He uses technical terms (after explaining them) and expects you to keep up. He doesn't condescend. He also shows his passion. You can really hear his love of science showing through, and his excitement at the possibilities, which is completely endearing.So yeah. I need more books by this guy."
69,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8196213-ankit,5,"Einstein once said, ""Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler."" Professor Ramachandran's book is perfect example of how to achieve this. The most important thing which attracts me towards any science book is confluence of uncompromised complex science and simplicity of expression. One without the other is not interesting. One such perfect combination is Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"".Professor Ramachandran's quest in neurscience takes us on a remarkable journey in understanding the human brain. His plain and simple articulation of how answers to some of the most complex scientific and philosophical questions can be found in brain is most important achievement of this book. His unique method of attempting to understand these problems by examining brains which are not working as they ought to opens up a world with a plethora of new experiments for the neuroscientists and hence a world of new hopes for patients suffering the dreadful mental disorders. The book hence is unique as it gives insights to the layman into the functionings of human brain and how it connects to human nature, consciousness, and experience. At the same time, it is important for researchers in this area to inform themselves about this hitherto unlooked new dimension for understanding the enigma called human brain.Full marks to Professor Ramachandran for this one. I look forward to read his other works."
70,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1666348-chiara,3,"I think I've read too many brain books. I think this may be quite an enjoyable read for someone who hasn't read a lot about neuropsych previously. There are some really interesting disorders covered in here. My favourite chapter was probably one of the early ones, on synaesthesia. I did enjoy the book from the start, but towards the end, a couple of comments turned me right off - first, an incorrect definition of Munchausen by proxy, and second, stating that Oppositional Defiance Disorder was a made up disorder that unnecessarily labels feisty kids. While scepticism for disorders like these are probably a good idea, such a provocative statement without a citation, given that there are plenty of OTHER studies indicating poorer outcomes and other measurable problems...yeah. Bit of a hasty statement, I thought. I also didn't agree with his assessment that its absurd to argue that humans and apes (and other animals) are similar, and that humans are obviously uniquely special. While it's certainly an ongoing debate, coming down so hard on the 'humans are superior' side was not to my taste.Buuut, apart from those little things, it was a worthwhile book, particularly for someone with a short attention span like me, who can't handle a book that doesn't shift topics every chapter :D"
71,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31723515-murali-ss,4,"I was introduced to this book by a close friend of mine and the theme got me interested instantly. If you think this book is about making you more intelligent, you couldn't be more wrong. It rather revolves around the intriguing medical conditions encountered by the author (V.S. Ramachandran is also a world renowned neuroscientist) in his professional life and his unraveling of our neural networks in the course of the diagnosis. Just like how a detective goes about solving a crime by closely examining all the available clues, the author does the same with his crime scene - the human brain. He diagnosizes seemingly baffling conditions through brilliant hypothesis and simple but ingenious experiments. Though the topic is on neuroscience, for most parts the books is very accessible even to readers with non-medical background and keeps you deeply engrossed. It is amazing how much we have been able to figure out about our neural wiring and still there remains a lot to be known. Some of my favorite topics were mirror neurons, synesthesia, evolution of language and the concept of self awareness. But the final few chapters were a little abstract and I couldn't get myself to complete them (that's the reason for rating it one star less). In short, V.S. Ramachandran is the Sherlock Holmes of the neural world and this book is a must read for anyone fascinated by the grey matter !"
72,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,3,"I absolutely LOVED the first half of this book; I excitedly texted people about things I learned and inserted neuroscience facts in any conversation I could. However, at almost exactly the half-way mark, Ramachandran seemed to run out of topics that he had both studied in depth or had any case work for, including viable statistics. And this is where he lost me. He spent the next 150 pages ""debunking"" theories that he gave very little information on, only to put forth his own theories that also included zero statistics, perhaps an anecdote, but that's all. He takes quotes from Charles Darwin *completely* out of context (a personal pet peeve of mine), and spends 50 pages on the superiority of Indian sculpture and art. Which, fine, it's lovely, but was certainly the weakest part of the book. A man who self-proclaims not to be very interested in, or know much about art, spends two full chapters trying to lay out 9 essential rules and laws for ""good, high art."" Yet he doesn't describe any conversations he has with artists, has zero brain scans of artists vs non-artists for comparison, and frankly, seems to know NOTHING on some of the basic premises of art, both technical and emotional. Minus two stars, Ramachandran.I went back in my personal copy of this book and wrote in large letters on page 150 ""STOP! DO NOT KEEP READING! NO, I'M SERIOUS, PUT THE BOOK DOWN, NOW!"""
73,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27479337-captc,4,"Pretty good book. Lots of science, some of which was over my head, which is just fine with me. Happy to be challenged on some of the more technical stuff. Ramachandran has a pretty big ego. It seems he can back that up, although the book would have been better with a touch more humility. I also simply don't believe some of his musings. It takes on the tone of, ""Well, I've thought such and such and that seems pretty compelling to me."" Fine, I guess, but too much of that gets tiresome. And I think the book could have been shorter. My one big beef with the book concerns his forced attempt to ""prove"" humans are separate and apart and incomparably different than all other animals. Many of his arguments are strained to the point of him losing credibility. Of course humans are different. He tries to make the case that the difference is some kind of an insurmountable chasm. These arguments have been made, and fallen, ever since Darwin. To state just one example, he says human language is different because of the number of words we use. Well, absolutely true. Except that is hardly a chasm, it is entirely a difference of degree. And by the way, I find Frans de Waal not only compelling on the difference-only-by-degrees argument, but a much more interesting writer. (Yes, of course they are different experts, neuroscientist v. primatologist.)"
74,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/586014-thomas,4,"Fascinating and thought-provoking, but Ramachandran's positivism is worthy of critical reading. The root cause of every neurological symptom is for him a mechanical malfunction in the brain. Perhaps this is so by definition -- these are simply hypotheses proven through experiment. But the answers seem a little too pat for me. Was the source of Shakespeare's genius located in his angular gyrus? Well, part of it was, for without it his ability to employ metaphors would have been seriously impaired. But surely more was involved -- not only the parts of his brain but his life and circumstances -- and taken all together it made him who he was. I doubt Ramachandran would argue against this, and he does occasionally take a step back and look at the long view. But his approach is in general very mechanistic, which makes the work seem a bit cold and analytical. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Bedside manner won't steady the surgeon's hand. On the other hand, it seems a bit one-sided.I read this after reading Oliver Sacks' book Musicophilia, and it occurs to me now that Ramachandran and Sacks could write a great book together. Sacks would lend some warmth to Ramachandran's science, and Ramachandran could give Sacks' story telling a little more backbone. "
75,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29659800-lana-weshah,4,"This book is packed with amazing information; concepts, theories, ideas I haven't read about in the (some five) other neuroscience books I'd read. Ramachandaran ventures upon interesting subjects but, yes there's a but, his style of writing isn't my favorite, to say the least. He uses the same phrases over and over again. He is also somewhat contradictory in some parts of the book which left me quite lost and confused. His tone and style of writing isn't the best out there and that really affected my reading experience negatively. It took me ages to finish this book and when I was reading it I just wanted to put it down and do something else, it also led me to writing this review (this is my first review and isn't really a negative).On a much happier note though, the information in this book is priceless. I learned so much from this book and it really opened my eyes about some things; for example, the ""brain science"" of art. An amazing aspect of his writing is how he points out what is a hypothesis and not an actual fact, a necessity many science writers fail to mention. Also, while I found some of Ramachandaran's comments unnecessary, many of them made me giggle. So yeah I guess (way to be formal, Lana!)"
76,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,3,"In a word: meh. In a sentence: I won't be picking up any other Ramachandran books in the future.Ramachandran is certainly a gifted scientist. The work he's done in the field seems to have rightly earned him a god-amongst-men status in modern neuroscience. His experiments are curious and profound. All of these things, too, he likes to remind the reader of, whether subtly or otherwise.Some of the information in the book made it worth the read (blindsight, for example). Even so, it could have been a fraction of its length and you'd hear no complaints from me. Too much ink was spilt between droning, name dropping, and (humble?) bragging. Worse yet, while he worked his way through things that are in fact acutely human, the end game that I'd been sold on was that we'd land on how all those things roll up into human *consciousness.* That's what I wanted to read about ultimately. The final chapter, which said to concern itself with that chapter, did a lackluster job—hardly one at all, really—of handling the topic. This admittedly may have been owing, at least in part, to my own fatigue with the read by this point in the journey.The experience of the book I'd give a 2-2.5. Some of the incredibly interesting content garners a 4-5 star rating. So we'll settle with 3 in the end. "
77,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"V.S. Ramachandran uses case studies to demonstrate the abilities of the brain. He describes the brain as having certain modules that accomplish tasks. Let us take the sense of vision as an example. With vision, you can have people that can see perfectly well, but they can't tell when things are moving. It is quite fascinating to read about all of the things that the brain can do.So Ramachandran comes up with ways to show that these things are an actual reality for the patient or why these symptoms and situations occur. The tests that he comes up with for Synesthesia are really interesting. Apparently, at the time, it was not considered to be something real.The book is divided into nine chapters, with each chapter discussing a different part that makes us human. Chapter one discusses phantom limbs and brain plasticity. Chapter two discusses seeing and all of the different modules involved. Chapter three is about synesthesia. Chapter four is about Mirror Neurons. Chapter five is about autism. Chapter six is about the fundamental basics of language acquisition. Chapter seven is about aesthetics and how art is appreciated. Chapter eight contains more about art and how universal it is. Chapter nine discusses introspection and how that came to be."
78,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4446624-christian,5,"Two parts of this excursion into the brain sets it apart from other books I've recently read about neuroscience and the self. This book makes you feel part of the quest to understand human nature and how the brain works. You follow a real scientist, with real cases and his own experiments- not just a retelling of the scientific literature. Ramachandran has managed to address the curious laymen and paved a path for further scientific explorations with numerous suggestions for further research or ideas that need to be explored. This was a refreshing dip into the scientific process. The second aspect that sets this book apart is a bold and authoratative assurance that the author has, gleaned from years of observation and speculation no doubt, that are his musings into areas often not considered ""scientific"". . He addresses ideas of beauty and art as well as maladies with an equal eye to explaining how the brain functions to paint our personal worldview for our use.. a view that also allows us to intospectively watch ourselves at the same time. Really enjoyed this book and will likely re-read it for an ever deeper understanding."
79,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4507206-ram-n,5,"V.S. Ramachandran is celebrated as the ""The Marco Polo of Neuroscience"" by Richard Dawkins! One Genius can't be wrong about the other! can they?!I found this book at Odyssey book store in ITPL, Bangalore. Not wasting a moment, bought it! Priced at Rs. 499/-- this I definitely felt was more precious than Eclipse or New Moon or even Lord of the Rings, which also are priced more or less the same.Ramachandran is first among the many who diverted my lines of thinking into a more neurological, psychological and cognitive pattern. This book tagged ""Unlocking the mystery of Human Nature"" is definitely bound to pull many more able brains to this wonderful, yet relatively unexplored field of Science.The teasers(which this book hardly needs) in the book cover's third paragraph inside reads,""The brain remains a mystery to us. How can a three pound mass of jelly that we can hold in our palm imagine angels, contemplate the meaning of infinity, and even question its own place in the cosmos?"" Sounds interesting? Igniting a spark? Go ahead, make an investment."

In the first part, he makes a brilliant argument for why humans are not mere apes or chimps. Then he goes on to talk about language, eyesight, autism, aesthetics, introspection, weaving in interesting cases of patients with rare disorders. There flow of thought throughout the book is easy and keeps you interested, which is impressive considering the length of the book and the topics covered.Ramachandran does not refrain from letting us know his exact opinions. There are quite a few politically incorrect statements lurking inside. For me, this actually works! He has gained enough of my respect for me to be interested in what he thinks about aesthetics and religion and politics.At the fag end of the book, there is a quote by Darwin questioning the ability of human intellect to figure out creation! Ramachandran signs off by making a sweeping statement about how understanding the brain (and by extension, the self) and the cosmos it creates need not necessarily mean humans can understand creation."
81,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12112147-colin,3,"What I wanted was revealing stories of real people whose brains don't work like mine, and some explanation of their experience that would give me a better understanding of the different parts of the brain. I got a lot more speculation, and a lot more abstraction than I was hoping for. In the latter half of the book it seems like specific patients almost disappear. I found it difficult to care about the rudiments of art without the stories of real people, and without that kind of grounding, much of the evolutionary speculation went too far towards teleology for my taste.I was familiar with some of Ramachandran's work on phantom limbs and synaesthesia before picking up this book. The parts on those topics are, I think, the strongest in the book, although the chapters on vision and on autism are also excellent. What those chapters are full of is the ""old school"" science a Darwin or a Faraday could have practiced, and which the author professes a special affection for on many occasions. Would that he had more experiments with mirrors and water droplets to enliven the later chapters too."

Given that, however, it is a great book by the Doctor who discovered that mirrors may be used to help individuals with phantom limb syndrome. It is really quite amazing and informative and tells about how various afflictions of the brain can affect the personality and the abilities and interests of the individual concerned and about what all this tells us concerning the brain and its workings. It also explains why when one is suffering from appendicitis, one first tends to feel pain in the center of one’s body rather than on the lower right side where the appendix is located. If you wish to understand more about the brain and how our sense of self is shaped by it, this is a great book to read.

83,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81941983-zach-galvin,4,"Ramachandran had a lot of interesting ideas. My favorite was the speculation around mirror neurons playing a significant role in the gap in human evolution where we seem to have all of a sudden just taken off. However, it got a little dry at times, and it was very much just his rambling thoughts more than anything organized or concrete. I gave it 4 stars, but I would say it deserves 3.5. "
84,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4632088-sean,4,"This book was a very interesting, and fun read. Dr. Ramachandran explains in the concepts in a way that is very easy to read throughout most of the book. Even to a beginner in psychology, this book was fun, easy to read, and above all, useful. In this book, as the title describes, Dr. Ramamchandran delves into the depths of what makes us human, whether it be evolution, religion, the prefrontal cortex, or a mix of all of them. This book is not only interesting because of the topics discussed, but because most of the ideas and theories are backed up with actual evidence, such as case first-hand case studies from Dr. Ramachandran. The only reason I rate this book 4 stars is because while it is very easy to read, it's still a book on psychology, and can, at some parts, put you to sleep. The ending is also something to applaud the author over. (I won't tell you it) But I like the fact that he supports certain theories with hard facts, but also leaves it slightly open for you to determine for yourself what you think really does make us human."

However, I kept getting turned offor distracted in some way.Throughout the book, Ramachandran scatters small bits of weakhumor. Rather than bringing a friendly, conversational style tothe text, these generally fell flat. Why did he feel the need tocast aspersions against California surfers, Jewish mothers, Bush,Cheney, and Republicans in general? Flimsy analogies about oralsex and other sexual inuendo also went nowhere.This book covers a huge amount of material. Perhaps because of itsvery scope, it starts to read like unsupported hypothetical analogyrather than well researched science. There are an awful lot of descriptions that come out sounding like, 'Wow, here is yet anothervery unusual mential illness!' instead of 'here is evidence tosupport a thesis'Interesting material, but I did not come away with a great degreeof confidence in its authenticity."

However I was proved wrong and discovered its appeal is in its engaging style, clarity and revelatory factual knowledge.In many ways his style is similar to the late Oliver Sacks, with slightly more technical information. For a large part the author deliberates convincingly, on the role of the mirror neuron in enhancing and evolving anatomical structures of the primate brain, into the current human version. He also spends much time on demonstrating the pathways through which information processing flows and shows how malfunctions in these networks reveal their inner workings and effect their outputs. There seems to be some criticism regarding the authors politics and his autobiographical style, but this is mainly a mechanism to prevent him producing a text book and enhancing the readability factor. I personally didn't find it obtrusive or unwarranted in the least. "
87,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160809-ani-artinyan,4,"Ramachandran covers several topics, namely visual perception and synesthesia, phantom limbs, autism, language evolution, aesthetics and art. All of them are discussed in the light of the debate on the uniqueness of the human species in the animal kingdom. The author argues that in the course of evolution, several brain areas have evolved which are (or whose size or level of specialization is) characteristic for humans and to which some of the phenomena listed above can be partially attributed. Another core assumption he makes is related to the role of mirror neurons in the human condition and how they provide a neural basis not only for the ""theory-of-mind"" idea, but also for the delicate interaction of the self with the rest of the world. Ramachandran unites all these topics by suggesting that the self and its consciousness manifest their subtle and complex workings in various ways and that we have an excellent opportunity to study them more thoroughly by looking at the (surprise, surprise!) disturbances of self and mind through neurological and neuropsychiatric methods."
88,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391424-rachael,4,"Highly enjoyable account of a variety of topics related to the brain, proposed explanation for synethesia, autism, apraxia and a number of other conditions. The first half of the book is focused on research done by Ramachandran and what these reveal about how our brains work, particularly focusing on the role of mirror neurons and the slippery nature of modules in the brain. The second half is a more playful and speculative account of the evolution of language, art and consciousness. Though I am suspicious of evolutionary psychology it's still fun to see where it might lead. Also, the author is overly optimistic about how many questions his account does offer about philosophical questions relating to language and consciousness, no doubt they are greatly informed by findings in neurology. Knowing the physical mechanisms necessary to have a sense of self, for instance, and how they interact, even more specifically the parts necessary for a sense of free will, are fascinating."

There were a lot of illuminating examples. His style is more popular than Oliver Sack's Awakening, which was overly clinical for my tastes. This also doesn't appear to be targeted at medical students either, although he does describe various ideas for experiments to explore further possible theories around particular functions. His own technique of discovering is quite simple and practical. My own bone to pick, is that in some of the early chapters his descriptions of women felt overly sensual. I was feeling some discomfort in the descriptions. I suggest that might just be me, but I'd be curious if others noticed anything similar. "

But to his credit, Dr Ramachandran has made it as easy as it can be for everyone to understand it. One thing is sure... read the actual book rather than the audio book I listened to... as there is lot of illustrations associated with the written material. His research and concept of mirror neurons, its relation to autism and other human behaviours as well as his speculations based on some calculated educated guess work seems very reasonable. It gets a little bit too much when he talks about art and veers away from the main topic at hand although it was an interesting new knowledge for me. Overall its a great read.... but be prepared for some real medical jargon and complex neural circuitry weave a magical web around you."
271,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In The Tell-Tale Brain V.S. Ramachandran uses case examples of neurological disorders to explore the brain and aspects of its operation that make human beings unique within the animal kingdom. Topics include phantom limbs, synesthesia, mirror neurons, perception, a rather awkward chapter that attempts to define characteristics of art, as well as a discussion of consciousness and the sense of self. While the text is informative and suitable for a non-expert with an interest in science, I found Ramachandran’s writing style extremely dry and somewhat of a chore to get through. "
272,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106232-nishant-deshpande,4,"I am a V.S. Ramachandran fan - watched some of his TED talks and read some of his writing. This is the first book by him that I have read, and it did not disappoint.Ramachandran is a practicing neuroscientist, and so all his finding come wrapped in amazing cases that he has personally seen with patients / research subjects. This makes the book really engaging.We learn so much about the brain when we see ""malfunctions"" of the brain. This is a great companion to reading one of my favorite all-time books - ""Thinking, Fast and Slow""."
273,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241353-kathy,3,"(Actually 2 1/2 stars) Dr. Ramachandran is obviously a brilliant neuroscientist, but in this book he shows himself also to be a very arrogant man, who dismisses as idiotic people whose views vary significantly from his, especially anyone with any kind of religious faith. He also is dismissive of any view of human behavior other than that of neuroscience. I learned some interesting this here, but I also lost a good deal of my respect for the doctor, and am unlikely to read any more of his work."
274,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/775264-leslie,4,"Dr. Ramachandran clearly has a genius for generating rich hypotheses, and creative ways of testing them, about the complex neural networks in the human brain. His explanations of what is known about the neural networks, his narratives about their discoveries, his metaphors linking different networks, and the gestalt he generates about the probable overall workings of the mind, are incredibly clear and operationally helpful."
275,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041214-a-j,3,"Really fascinating. As a physician (who does not practice neurology) it was a nice trip back to medical school, anatomy lab... the lessons we learn from the unfortunate may help benefit future individuals. The prose style is a bit thick for many readers. Not for everyone, but if you have interests in neurology (from Autism, to strokes, to why we can contemplate our own existence) this is an intersting read."
276,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3501898-richard-thompson,4,"Some of the material in this book was familiar from PHANTOMS IN THE BRAIN, but Ramachandran's explorations of the neurological underpinnings of beauty, art, Consciousness and selfhood is new territory for me. Lots of interesting case histories. Somewhat technically challenging in places, but Ramachandran is very adept at making the material understandable. Reminder to self: read the last few chapters aloud to Maggee in the near future"
277,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/634200-pancha,4,"Not quite a follow up to his earlier Phantoms of the Brain, more of a companion, although it does revisit some of the cases he talked about therein. The information about mirror neurons and their therapeutic potential is fascinating and well worth picking up this book. However, Ramachandran's sense of humor runs towards the dirty old man end of the spectrum and can be intrusive in the text. His two chapters on art theory felt shoehorned in, and weren't particularly persuasive."
278,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373093-henry-manampiring,4,"VS Ramachandran makes another brilliant account of neuroscience for all we the mortals. From neurology patients, he works out the working of human brain, and its deep consequence. If you read this, eventually you will come to the territory of philosophy and religion, revisiting the concept of ""consciousness"" and ""soul"".Although can get technical is some parts, generally it is an exciting book. Recommended if you are intrigued or want to know more about the human brain!"
279,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5210186-dora-truong,4,"Fascinating stuff in here about mirror neurons and how we learn. Hopeful parts about his work with amputees suffering from 'phantom pain' in the missing limbs was also good reading. Right now I am in the chapter about how we see and respond to art. I liked the mention of bower birds and how their beautiful creations lure potential mates. Considering that he must be a mensa member, the book is very readable and well explained. He is someone that I will likely read again."

Overall, I found The Tell-Tale Brain boring, self-indulgent, unfocused, and rambling. I didn't like the author's personality as it came through in the reading. Maybe reading the text provides a better experience, especially because the audio book repeatedly refers to figures that cannot be seen. It's an audio book!"
281,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5803318-anna-huynh,3,"I thought it was always important to know how our brains function. Plenty of scientific info for your brain. It was able to provide a scientific viewpoint about autism, where the mirror neurons are not functioning well, however, it was not able to connect together their findings and current therapies used to benefit those who have it. But that was just a small section that caught my attention. If you're interested in those type of things, check it out. "

I'm sorry, but I can't stomach any more of Ramachandran's relentless insistence that human beings are ""superior primates."" I mean, he crams this precept down the reader's throat so hard I felt like it was going to come out my patootie! He is a great brain scientist, but his ""scientific"" conjecture was too much for me to handle...even if he does say it with a smile and a nice dose of condescension. :-p"

The most interesting part for me is knowing different path between knowing something and feeling something. Sadly, while this book is well written, it still have tons of jargon from neuroscience that student from Psychology like me finds alien. I think Dr. Ramachandran have to consider jargon using if he wants to reach general audience like he said in his preface."

I was happy that there was an extensive glossary in the back of the book. I especially liked the chapter on Synesthesia since my daughter has this interesting condition. I also enjoyed the discussion concerning art and the brain. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the intricate workings of the brain and the nature of mankind. 
286,0393077829,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"This book is well written, has excellent stories, and makes use of fabulous science-- most of which Ramachandran personally uncovered. Being a neuro major, this info was not new to me. The way he put it together was not new for me either. For someone who hasn't studied but loves the mind, this book is perfect. His work in synesthesia is wonderful. His arguments one why humans are special was better than I imagined it would be (I am an antihumanist). Overall-- fairly good. "
