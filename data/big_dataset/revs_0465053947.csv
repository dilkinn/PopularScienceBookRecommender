0,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,5,"Anyone who relies on intuitive deduction (and there’s a lot about intuitive theories in this book), will instantly surmise that I am related to the author, Andrew Shtulman. That much is true: Andrew and I are cousins (although Andrew might argue that all humankind is composed of cousins, even if it’s thirty times removed). What is also true is that even if we weren’t, I would still 5-star this book because it’s thought-provoking, intelligently written, fascinating in parts, and also carries an important message: we are squandering our future by turning our collective backs on the knowledge of science.Andrew’s premise is this: intuitive theories impede not just how much we think but how we live—the choices we make, the advice we take, the goals we pursue. The problem with relying on intuition, instead of research-based evidence, is two-fold: first, intuitive theories are usually wrong. And second, they can actually cause harm, as is evidenced by a distrust of pasteurization or vaccination because they’re not “pure” or not taking action on climate change because “it doesn’t feel warmer.”The book is divided into two parts: intuitive theories of the physical world and intuitive theories of the biological world. Here is where I need to interject that I have an atrophied left brain, and have never had a firm understanding of “all things logical”, including the sciences and math. Fortunately, the exposition is very accessible without feeling dumbed down. Take matter, for example. The subhead is: What is the world made of? How do those component interact? Or take gravity: What makes something heavy? What makes something move?While the first half of the book was more of an expository nature, the second half really ignited my imagination because it touches on questions like: what makes us alive? Why do we grow older? Why are there so many life forms and how do they change over time? I had to question my assumptions of why one thing (say, a plant) is alive and another (say, the sun) is not and how we evolve and grow. Most importantly, in this era of religion-led anti-evolution fervor, I recognized what’s really at stake: nothing less than understanding and accepting the trajectory of life/death and recognizing why living things are so exquisitely adapted to their environments.By recognizing the nuances, we can accept that aging, for example, is one continuous change rather than a series of discrete changes rather than one continuous change and that inheritance is the reproductive transmission of genetic information, not just a consequence of nurture. Yes, scientific knowledge complicates our understanding of the world rather than dumb it down or force us to believe a magical force will keep us safe in times of trouble. But with so much at stake – from stem cell research to life-saving antibiotics, form nuclear energy to climate change—how can we afford to continue to live blindly? Reevaluating our intuitive theories is a major step in helping guide us not only to how we live, but why we live."
1,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,2,"Bookblind: Why are my Theories about the World between the Covers so Often Wrong?“Still, resistance to science in today’s age – an age flush with scientific information and science education – requires explanation. Many ... point to ideology as an explanation,”  writes Andrew Shtulman in his introduction,  “Others point to misinformation, as when vaccines were falsely linked to autism ...”  YES!, I thought, this is the book we all need to read; god knows we need to raise the level of scientific awareness these days. But I should have paid more attention to how he continued:  “But these factors are not the only causes of science denial. Psychologists have uncovered another: intuitive theories. ”  Well, after reading the book I have to disagree as to the importance of that. Denial of science is just not the same thing as misunderstanding it. So unfortunately, the tone and thrust of scienceblind,  while well written and quite readable, is to my mind, entirely in the wrong direction. In twelve chapters that cover topics in the physical and biological sciences, Shtulman exhaustively documents childhood psychology research in those areas; so if you want to know how infants and young children interpret natural phenomena and make sense of the world around them, then this is the book for you. (Though I have to say, if he had played peekaboo with his kids a little more, Shtulman might not have put quite so much store on how long holding a baby’s attention related to its “mature expectations about solidity”)But the book says much less about adults’ intuitive views of the world, and until the last couple of chapters on genetics and evolution, nothing about their misconceptions that is really relevant or important to understanding current scientific or medical controversies. Virtually every example concerns children up to about eleven years old. Yes, we all go through those stages of understanding, but adults do actually evolve beyond that, and although Shtulman’s thesis is that we don’t, he doesn’t really present much evidence for that. (And if any adults are still struggling with Object Permanence, well, there’s no hope for that lot anyway - talking to you, Climate Change Deniers)So, I have a fairly long list of things I had problems with – I feel obliged to do this because the book has received such rave reviews. First, the minor stuff. There are some curious “huh...??” moments: for example, he claims that only psychology teaches the role of vision in the study of light, which is total nonsense of course; it is part of any basic physics course. If adults don’t know or remember what they learned, well yes, that does point to a deficiency in teaching methods or science literacy – the very point he was trying to make; the problem is, in the grand ranking of misunderstandings, it really isn’t that important. I don’t think adults have strong emotional attachments to beliefs about things like vision, so it would probably be relatively easy to re-educate them, if that were necessary. Perhaps even through the tutorials that he seems to love so much. In another section he says “Four-year-olds, in general, are surprisingly bad at discerning the nutritional value of food.” [my emphasis]. You don’t say! And this is a man who has two kids of his own; I really wonder what conversations went on in his house. And this: ”Indeed, it’s presumptuous to think that preschoolers have acquired a germ theory of disease from casual exposure to germ-related talk when it took scientists hundreds of years to discover germ theory”. Umm, yes. It certainly is. But who thinks preschoolers have a coherent theory of germs?And what can you say about someone who writes, without the slightest wink or trace of irony, that “we quibble over whether the glass is half full or empty, when in reality it is always full of both liquid and gas?” Perhaps that was supposed to be a joke, but Shtulman is no Bill Bryson (see A Short History of Nearly Everything), and humour is not one of his tools. So the appearance of not one but two satirical research reports from The Onion, which he quotes for no obvious reason, seem startlingly misplaced. I’m afraid Shtulman simply comes across as an earnest and dedicated teacher with a sincere desire to educate the world, but who is trapped in the bubble of his own psychological research. And for this reason, I believe he is simply wrong to place incorrect intuitive ideas as the core reason for the current state we find ourselves in. Here is a prime example of why: He (also) incorrectly says that interbreeding and genetic engineering are the same thing. (They are not, and he needs to read his own chapter on inheritance – the first is something that could have occurred through evolution, but with a big helping hand to speed it along; gene splicing has never occurred spontaneously). But anyway, following from that, he proceeds to disparage concerns about GMO as being non-scientific, and backs it up with a straw man example of a survey showing people are concerned about “DNA” in food. Well, my concerns are not with GM corn being dangerous to eat – I simply don’t want anything to do with a multinational that is trying to monopolize the world’s strains of corn, patenting a monoculture that is resistant to toxic levels of weedkiller, and suing farmers found with their patented seed and even entire countries that decline to be part of the racket. In short, I am wary of GMO because of a documented history of Bad Corporate Behaviour, and my knowledge about genetics, or lack of it, has nothing to do with it. It is this political/social component, and the rise of the Internet as a (mis)information medium, that is probably the most important aspect of science knowledge and science denial today.Why is there so much antipathy to scientific and medical knowledge these days? Why does stating “97% of scientists agree on climate change” convince many of just the opposite? (Shtulman seems to believe that this is a matter of science education not having promoted this fact enough!)And how could more or better medical / statistical knowledge have enabled anyone to see through the vaccine – autism link? It’s not as if medical interventions have never had unforeseen side-effects. Shtulman writes, “those parents couldn’t wrap their minds around the idea of injecting their children with an inactivated virus.” NO! The real problem was that Wakefield had an interest in the outcome, fabricated the study, the faked results were amplified through the bullhorn of the internet and social media, and happened to gel with certain parents’ (not-unjustified) antipathy to Big Pharma. Many of these parents were college-educated and liberal – the exact group that Shtulman says are least susceptible to incorrect scientific intuition, so that gives the lie to better education being the solution right there.These are absolutely critical questions – ones that Shtulman even mentions in his introduction – and then utterly fails to address. I know, I know, I shouldn’t be criticizing scienceblind for not being the book I thought it was, but honestly, I was really disappointed. So read this book if you want a clear but wordy look at how children develop ideas about science, or if you want to educate yourself out of your scientific misconceptions – though I think you actually have to be quite science-literate to read it in the first place."
2,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68771053-danny-strickland,5,"I loved this book. It was clear and cogent, entertaining and enlightening. The content is deep, and the writing is lucid. It's a guiding light in our troubled times of science denial."
3,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68490062-ed,5,"Interesting, informative, eloquent. A must-read for anyone who values science."
4,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68490924-evan,5,This book skillfully accomplishes two goals: it shows us how we misunderstand several scientific topics and it shows us the right way to think about those topics. Highly recommended for anyone interested in psychology in particular or science in general.
5,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34598252-sam-benson,3,"There were parts of this that I really liked, and on the whole, it’s fascinating stuff. Sometimes it got a little cringy (e.g. there was an example that felt pretty fat shame-y and another that seemed to simplify and equate gender to chromosomal sex). And he got a bit self righteous with his “science is the only way to know the big T truth” thing. I just found it a bit heavy handed at times and think he didn’t really acknowledge other types of truly valuable knowledge that intuition or tradition can bring us. That’s very nuanced, and there wasn’t a lot of nuance in this book. "
6,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3927423-hamza,5,"My summary: in the absence of learned knowledge, human intuition is an adaptation that helps us make sense of the world (a fundamentally flawed sense). Even when we are privy to the evidence-based models, we fall back to our (incorrect) intuitive models of reality when under stress. These are formed during our developmental years, and are merely suppressed, not erased, as we age. We use these in everyday reasoning, subconsciously, even if we think we know better.As someone with little (read: no) background in psychology, I appreciated the straightforward progression of this book, starting with its thesis statement disclosed from the outset (quite literally in the title), through to its conclusion, citing evidence and building conceptually on previous topics. The author does supply the occassional personal anecdote (and Onion excerpt) to complement the research references (that occupy the majority of the text) to keep the material from being too dry. One detractor: several experiments performed in studies as supporting evidence are described that are less than straightforward to visually construct in your head - supplemental figures would have been useful for these.As a side effect of the content usually having to do with correcting intuitive misconceptions, you will get a bonus refresher on a lot of high school/undergraduate-level science (some of which you may have found your knowledge of to be embarrassingly nebulous, if it's been a while. Obviously, I'm not talking about myself).Mostly excellent. 4.5/5."
7,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186483-beau,3,"A well-researched, interesting book, but it fails to live up to its thesis and praise. The author simply doesn't concentrate enough on adults and why they ""deny science in the teeth of overwhelming evidence,"" as one reviewer puts it on the back of the book. There is too much emphasis on what children believe, especially with regard to concepts they clearly outgrow. For example, the book's aim is not furthered by giving page after page (with diagrams) explaining that small children believe that they live on a flat space in the center of a sphere called the earth, or that they live on a place called ""the ground"" while the ""earth"" is a sphere floating above them in the sky along with the moon and sun. Not only do children clearly outgrow this (in more than 99% of the cases), but it is actually quite obvious that children would hold such strange beliefs as they struggle to reconcile the facts that they live on a place--called the ground--that appears very flat to them, and that they are told that the earth is ""round"" (""spherical"" or ""shaped like a ball"" would be better descriptions). This is just one of many examples that have probably nothing to do with why many adults are skeptical of science, ignorant of science, or even willfully opposed to science. It's really about a lack of education or quality education, and not just science education but an education in math, logic, and critical thinking.However, I was entertained and shocked by people's conception of the world and science. The book is peppered with little scientific quizzes for the reader. I have no special science training--beyond high school science, I took one year of physics in college and have no other science education, and yet the answers to all of the quizzes were obvious to me even though at the end of each the author kept saying ""most people believe the answer is..."" Again and again, majorities had it wrong on basic facts and ideas. None of the intuitive theories that majorities of people believe about the world ever occurred to me (unless I have forgotten them since childhood) and most seem quite ridiculous.Unfortunately we live in a country today in which the government is quite antagonistic towards and quite ignorant of science, and the policies being enacted are quite harmful to us all. I wonder if there is a book that explains why being a republican so often coincides with being anti-science and anti-logic."
8,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52065208-adam,3,"Hmmm. Maybe it’s just the way Barry Abrams read the audiobook but it all comes across as high and mighty, science is everything preaching. Shtulman cites numerous studies, including his own, as he warbles on about how silly our intuition is and how important the scientific method is. He makes some fine points yet I feel that I could have just jumped right to the conclusion for the gist of the whole thing. Not a complete waste of time and certainly not the best book I’ve read this week. Three stars for effort. "
9,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"To be honest, I probably would have given this book 5 stars regardless since this is a topic I've wanted explored in great depth for a long time. Frequently, in the works of great writers on science such as Pinker, Dawkins, Dennett, Tyson, and Krauss, you are briefly told that many of their concepts will seem non-intuitive due to certain features of our brains and development that make grasping such in-depth scientific notions quite difficult. However, there really hasn't been a full exploration as to just what those features and developmental processes are until this wonderful work from Andrew Shtulman.Covering topics from matter, energy and gravity through climate change, evolution and illness, Shtulman gives very detailed explanations as to why our in-born and more juvenile intuitions as to how things work are woefully inadequate when it comes to proper study of much of the natural world. His chapters on illness and evolution are the most compelling but the entire work is worthy of very wide recognition. I would love the implementation of this material into general science courses ASAP, this would save so much time convincing ""mature"" adults to dump their pseudo-scientific notions and foster a generation of much more self-aware, critical thinkers. Perhaps this would help prevent non-scientific ""objections"" to vaccinations or senators bringing snowballs into the Senate to ""disprove"" climate change.I would have loved for even greater coverage of physics and in particular particle-physics but perhaps this is such an obscure realm of study that it didn't merit mentioning in the author's eyes. Understandable, but given that this is the domain with the greatest explanatory power that deals with natural forces that are the most difficult to understand, some bridging of this gap would have served Shtulman's work well, at least in my eyes.However, there is so much material here that is needed in modern education today and Shtulman himself sums this up beautifully towards the end of the work: ""Our modern way of life is thoroughly dependent on science, so we must take obstacles to understanding science seriously. We must take intuitive theories seriously. We must create environments that help us become aware of those theories and craft instruction that helps us overcome them, in the classroom and beyond. Intuitive theories will be with us forever, as they are reinvented by every child in every generation. Let's not let the theories we construct as children constrain the opportunities we pursue as adults."""
10,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,Very good book on how our intuitions about physics and biology get in the way of actually understanding real physics and real biology. It spends a lot of time on our concepts that we develop as children and assume without a good science education and goes a long way in explaining the public misunderstandings which go beyond mere political or religious ideology. Don't get me wrong politics and religion are major culprits in our misunderstandings of science but these misunderstandings are easily embraced because of our faulty intuitions about physics and biology.
11,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32852196-nigel-senton,3,"It’s hard to rate I kept getting it confused with the authors legibility if he was using connotations or a contronyms examples so the book title kept going to blind science or science blind which I guess is the point of a thesis or Socrates teaching of trail for not keeping records of knowledge questions or being any psychologist thought of conservative thinking. I really thought the author put to much on addressing intuitive knowledge when he was wanting to give more introspective knowledge. Which I rarely saw my head exploding more than the lit talking to me if I was 5 years old. I sped it up later to 1.5X not to be offended by idiocy of the book needing to address religion or green science but really wondered in a quasi mess to find bracketing or breaching of Nouvelle/metropolitan be called science. In the authors efforts of economics or sociology I thought most it gave more example or literary purpose to explain kids examples to have delays but as adults with delays should be religious or against green logic so I put most my segueing with in the book on to seeing much excessive faith in science is epistemological unsound, Author: No, that’s not true. That’s impossible Dark Vador: The scientific methods has limits. Insisting other wise is a dogma called scientism. Look it up!Author:Noooooo!Narrator:That’s how in the moment Dark vador told the author he was his father.Apparently he could be,A parent has to tell himself to be a parent to droves of delays that’s apparently the parents job as it can’t happen just to say if your an adult to call yourself an adult.Odd kids would do have delays, not really, as adults with Delay’s should be SinTaxed for not having introspection might solve by not reading or would fall into being an intuitive mess is grammatically a wander not a wonder what the author is trying to saying, he’s lost. I’m lost just listening to him being lost. And quite frankly there’s enough conspiracy theories and controversy that a person doesn’t need more opinion or don’t need to be decided cause there enough information a person doesn’t have to. To see it as speculatory or succeeding is prospect’s might be the difference in crony capitalism or good capitalism and what a person wants. I regret getting as far as I did in this book. Following the line or reading between the line was a fifth grader science popularly agenda of this books audience and I felt I went back way back to a grade of chewing paper to understand it as polite or political conundrum. Mostly wasted my time, to vacillate what’s needing to be ethnomethodically impaired.I guess the book would of captivated me if i wasn’t so anxious mirroring my thoughts from it here on out,That someone out for coffee talk leads this book would of been more intuitive as if the author never talked like his shit didn’t stink or how any amount of truth they’d be many domination of that story saying amount of different truth of it.Say likeSurprising news, pooperia has properties such as essential oil in a Toilet bowl is sense of how much this book is beautifully shaped in science but blind like in synthesicism. That smell of fragrant or potpourri in old days made the room smell like it was on a round cloth frames was once only 102.5 pound shit, be what some teen spirit shits per year but most adults shit about 402 pounds a year,,, excitement is science worth of wondering where, how, or what should be a vocation. So really does this book trigger Raison d’être?I’ll leave it to the remarkable reviewer who had elegance to marked it so high."
12,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,5,"This book is about research done to uncover how we understand the world before formal instruction, and how those ideas tend to persist (causing a lot of problems). Most of the research centers around children, but as an adult, I still recognize how a few of these still trip me up. There are some examples though that I am convinced are just the result of poor questionnaires, polling, or the American Education System, because there's no 'psychological' reason for that category of ignorance. As an example, apparently 70% of adult respondents said yes, they would like a label indicating which food contains DNA. This number seems a bit high... I absolutely love the topic of this book. It is just so interesting how we form intuitive theories about the world, without ever really knowing about them. It is also really important to understand them, both for educators and for researchers who should be aware of their own biases. This book is also very well researched and written. It doesn't overburden you with information or digressions, and is structured in a coherent way that helps you make sense out of it all. Not everything in here might hold up to further research, but this book encompasses the current understanding of the field, and it's level of confidence adequately transpires. There is a lot of converging evidence on all the points made, and also alternative explanations that currently circulate."
13,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72636435-shane-orr,5,"I'd never really thought about why our gut instincts on the way things work in this world are often wrong. But when you consider how many hundreds of years (in many cases) it took scientists and thinkers to arrive at currently accepted answers, it makes sense. If the accepted science was intuitive, it would have been obvious even to them. This book covers theories of the physical and biological world and talks about not only what the common misconceptions are, but what types of teaching or tools it would take to overcome them. Many teaching methods for math and physics only get students to know how to arrive at the answer, but not how to understand why the answer works. Shtulman makes a compelling case about why it's so important that we learn the why so that we can make informed decisions about policy that are grounded in reality.It was interesting that some of the incorrect theories are so intuitive that even scientists themselves have trouble. There are chapters on evolution, GMOs, vaccines, illness, cosmos, etc.Why do we have two tides per day? Why does the moon's shape appear to change over the course of the month? What causes the earth's seasons? Your first instincts on those might be wrong. Did you know that the ""disgust face"" (scrunched nose and tongue sticking out) developed for practical reasons? All of this and more are in here."
14,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,4,"A helpful guide to showing that we all see the world through imperfect lenses. These filters are constructed by our biases, intuition, childhood instruction, natural selection, etc. Schtulman starts of strong, with insightful examples as to why we very naturally and understandably view parts of our world incorrectly. For example, watch this (short) video of a feather and bowling ball fall at the same rate in a vacuum... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frZ9d...How does it make you feel? Our intuition is often derived from our experience, and this is not something we experience day to day. If the bowling ball and feather fall at the same rate, does that mean they actually weigh the same? What is weight really? Our intuition often fogs or simplifies underlying truth.The middle of Scienceblind gets less innovative and more anecdotal, using example after example of how kids are taught or naturally come to understand the world around them. However, the overarching theme is that however our modes of thinking and processing came about, they are ubiquitous across ages, expertise (to a significant extent), and cultures. "
15,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19737770-jack-wolfe,4,"Occasionally I read a science book! This one's good. It doesn't do the ""social media science"" thing, blaming people and insulting people for their inability to grasp complex scientific theories. Shtulman's view is much more decent and much more scientific: he describes intuitive theories that are embedded in humans at birth, theories that are very difficult to get rid of, even after years of careful instruction. Each chapter takes a look at a different phenomenon-- the first half is about the physical sciences, the second half about biological-- and contrasts the correct, scientific understanding of the phenomenon with the incorrect, popular, intuitive understanding. Along the way we see lots of children failing, which is always a treat (i.e. ""Draw a spherical earth""... Kid draws a snowglobe earth). It's repetitive but necessarily so. If nothing else, it's a great way for novices (of which I am DEFINITELY one) to re-educate themselves about the way the world ACTUALLY works."
16,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2176491-cheryl,3,"When I first picked up this book, I didn’t expect there would be so much emphasis on what children believe and the misconceptions about science that children have. I was a science teacher for 35 years and I am probably more aware of children’s misconceptions about science than most, so much of this was not news to me. I did learn some interesting things from the section dealing with physics, “Intuitive Theories of the Physical World” (my background is in Biology and Chemistry) but I didn’t learn much from the section about “Intuitive Theories of the Biological World.” I would recommend this book to those who are interested in science, but would not recommend it for those who were science majors in college."

He also spends some time writing about how our everyday analogies reflect or maybe dictate the models - something I really got into when I was in school.There's also some side-by insight here that we might apply to the ongoing social change struggles we see everywhere these days. The human brain is both wondrous and absolutely weird in some of its doings."

Time to get back to it…)This book was totally different than what I expected. Chapters 1 through 10 seemed more like an introduction to the actual meat of the argument/book, and chapter 12 gave the best discussion of evolution that I have ever seen thus far. In the conclusion of the book, the ""science blindness"" was actually pointed out from the beginning, but some of the assumed conclusions from the first part really need a bit more emphasis!Overall, I think it was a pretty good book, but it could've been better; and as I say, chapter 12 was excellent, and that alone made the whole book worthwhile!

This one book gives educators the background knowledge and instruction to master these subjects in the classroom. For years there has been emphasis on the need to teach ""hands-on"" science and math without explaining to the teacher the ""why"" this is important. As a former sixth grade educator, I recommend this book for college credential programs and every teacher who cares enough to do a great job teaching science and math. "

Still worth reading especially if you are a superstitious person that always have a saying for everything. But then again if you are such person, you wouldn’t be interested in science. "

INTUITUVE theories vs SCIENTIFIC theories
XXXXX“The main goal of this book was to introduce…the reader to [his/her own biased perceptions or] own intuitive theories —theories [the reader] held explicitly in the past but only implicitly today, as well as theories [the reader] may still hold explicitly. The twelve intuitive theories covered in this book are not the only such theories we humans hold…But the twelve discussed [in this book] are rich enough and varied enough to show that intuitive theories do not fit a single mold…These biased perceptions [or intuitive theories] lead us down the wrong path when we theorize about the causes of [certain] phenomena, pushing us to draw distinctions that are empirically meaningless and to overlook distinctions that are empirically meaningful. Only scientific theories draw the right distinctions and thus only scientific theories can furnish us with [explanations] that are consistently accurate and broadly applicable.”The above quote (in italics) comes from this VERY informative book by Andrew Shtulman. Shtulman is an associate professor of psychology and cognitive science at Occidental College (in Los Angeles, California), where he directs the Thinking Lab. He has published several articles on conceptual development and conceptual change.Children turn basic ideas about the causes of everyday events into theories of the natural world within the first decade of life. These theories (called intuitive theories) remain the same from childhood onward, influencing our thinking, even as adults.But intuitive theories are usually wrong. As well, they interfere with our ability to learn better scientific explanations for how the world works thus making us blind to science.This book examines exactly how our intuitive theories develop and why they are so strong. Most importantly, this book shows us how we can break their strong grip on our thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours (with the aid of science) thus helping us see the world more clearly.Finally, presented in this book are extensive cognitive experiments done on children. These are interesting but I found them somewhat tedious to read. Some readers may, unfortunately, give up on this book for this reason. As well, the excellent conclusion of this book is presented in the Table of Contents as just another chapter.In conclusion, this book is definitely needed in this age of fake news and pseudo facts.

81,0465053947,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39496867-dmitry,3,Good idea of exposing reasons for our unbelief in science (pasteurization is counterintuitive because germs are counterintuitive!). But the way the book is written is somewhat repetitive and lacking excitement. P.S. loved conducting experiment on my 4 year old by making him compare tall and wide vessels of equal volume of water.

INTUITUVE theories vs SCIENTIFIC theories
XXXXX“The main goal of this book was to introduce…the reader to [his/her own biased perceptions or] own intuitive theories —theories [the reader] held explicitly in the past but only implicitly today, as well as theories [the reader] may still hold explicitly. The twelve intuitive theories covered in this book are not the only such theories we humans hold…But the twelve discussed [in this book] are rich enough and varied enough to show that intuitive theories do not fit a single mold…These biased perceptions [or intuitive theories] lead us down the wrong path when we theorize about the causes of [certain] phenomena, pushing us to draw distinctions that are empirically meaningless and to overlook distinctions that are empirically meaningful. Only scientific theories draw the right distinctions and thus only scientific theories can furnish us with [explanations] that are consistently accurate and broadly applicable.”The above quote (in italics) comes from this VERY informative book by Andrew Shtulman. Shtulman is an associate professor of psychology and cognitive science at Occidental College (in Los Angeles, California), where he directs the Thinking Lab. He has published several articles on conceptual development and conceptual change.Children turn basic ideas about the causes of everyday events into theories of the natural world within the first decade of life. These theories (called intuitive theories) remain the same from childhood onward, influencing our thinking, even as adults.But intuitive theories are usually wrong. As well, they interfere with our ability to learn better scientific explanations for how the world works thus making us blind to science.This book examines exactly how our intuitive theories develop and why they are so strong. Most importantly, this book shows us how we can break their strong grip on our thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours (with the aid of science) thus helping us see the world more clearly.Finally, presented in this book are extensive cognitive experiments done on children. These are interesting but I found them somewhat tedious to read. Some readers may, unfortunately, give up on this book for this reason. As well, the excellent conclusion of this book is presented in the Table of Contents as just another chapter.In conclusion, this book is definitely needed in this age of fake news and pseudo facts. I leave you with this books last two sentences:“Intuitive theories will be with us forever, as they are reinvented by every child in every generation.
