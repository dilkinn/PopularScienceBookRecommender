0,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24897389-richard,4,"Point a decent-sized radio antenna at any part of the sky, or just look up at it all on a cloudless night: not a trace of aliens - doesn't that strike you as odd?It struck physicist Enrico Fermi as very odd: if the laws of nature are universal, working in the same way all over the galaxy, and have produced the Earth, life (and us) here, then they should have produced Earths (and 'us') everywhere. Worse, our solar system may be more than four billion years old, but the Universe itself is more than thirteen billion - so there should have been Earths out there with their versions of us for aeons already. Yet here we are, apparently alone. This has become known as the Fermi Paradox - in Fermi's own words, 'Where is everybody?' - and the more we learn, the more mystifying it becomes: the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence programme has been running for decades now, without detecting even a single stray signal, while at the same time the latest space probes are discovering new planets by the truck-load. In fact, this isn't a full-blown paradox at all, just a flat contradiction between what, on the one hand, we believe to be the way the Universe works (its laws of nature, science as a rationale, reason itself for that matter) and, on the other, the Universe we seem to be living in. One of these must be incomplete or even wrong in some way. Perhaps the former; to give just one example, perhaps there are unknown phenomena at work, vast cataclysms which periodically sterilize the entire cosmos and set the clock of life back to zero each time - if that were the case then we would, in a sense, be the first. Or maybe it's the latter: Fermi's 'everybody' are all out there, but for some reason don't want us to know that.This book is a compendium of fifty possible explanations of that sort, from the stolidly scientific to the wildly speculative - and flawed: many contain assumptions about alien psychology for instance (just one alien civilization behaving differently from the rest would flood the galaxy with radio transmissions or speeding spaceships). It's a thorough round-up which also reminded me just how odd all this is; any way you look at it, that silent sky may be the single most important fact our civilization has."

2,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Examining their navels?This is the most up-to-date and thorough discussion of the Fermi Paradox that I have read. Stephen Webb examines all the popular solutions as well as some esoteric ones, giving us considerable background on each along with the benefit of his knowledge on a wide range of relevant subjects including microbiology, plate tectonics, evolution, intelligence, language, philosophy, as well as astronomy and cosmology. And then he gives his solution: we are alone.That was Fermi's solution of course, and it is a popular one; however I don't think that Webb comes anywhere near to making a convincing case; and at any rate he is somewhat equivocal about whether his answer applies to the entire universe or to just the galaxy. It is clear that his answer applies only to life as we know it, having a carbon based biochemistry and a cellular structure. My feeling is that intelligent life forms may evolve from some other chemical basis or even from some use of energy and matter we know nothing about.On pages 237 to 239 Webb presents his argument that we are the only extraterrestrial civilization (ETC) in the galaxy by a process of elimination, i.e., life must be on a planet within both a galactic habitable zone (GHZ) and a solar continuously habitable zone (CHZ) around the right kind of star; must avoid cosmic disasters like supernovae; must have the right kind of moon, Jupiter, and plate tectonics; must evolve beyond single cells; must develop tool use and language, etc. He ends up sifting out everything except us, and the only reason he doesn't sift us out is that he has set us aside since we actually exist!This is close to sophistry, perhaps, but it has been argued before. I might call it the Fallacy of Elimination by Unknown Probabilities about Matters that May or May Not Be Essential. Putting that aside, consider this: If we extrapolate from what we know (as opposed to any speculation) about the existence of life in just our own galaxy, we should expect on average--at the very least--one ETC per galaxy. Wow. Far from being alone, this suggests more than 100 billion other ETCs are out there, although we are not likely to ever communicate with them.One of the things this book demonstrates, as others have before (see especially, Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee's Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe [2000:], which Webb acknowledges as influential), is that when you're dealing with so little concrete information in such a vastness, it is impossible to be entirely convincing one way or the other. The conclusion in Rare Earth, with which Webb concurs, is that life is common in the universe, but intelligent life is rare. I agree substantially with this, but my ""rare"" is perhaps larger than their ""rare.""Some of the familiar but crucial questions considered here were addressed in the excellent Extraterrestrials: Where Are They? (1995) edited by Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart. For example, How long do ETCs exist before they go extinct? Is space travel enormously difficult and expensive or is it just very difficult? Do ETCs have a psychology similar enough to ours to make them want to communicate? How would they communicate, using what sort of medium?--even: would we recognize a communication from an ETC if we received one?The answer to these questions and many others is, we don't know. But it's fun to speculate; and in speculating at least we can eliminate many conceptual and logical errors that might crop up. Furthermore such speculations expand the mind and allow the imagination a greater range. In direct contrast to Webb I think there's only the smallest chance that we are alone. Amazing how people can come to such divergent conclusions from the same evidence!For such answers as, They are so advanced that they have no interest in communicating with us, and They are so into their own self-constructed pleasure-enhancing virtual existence that they care not to look outward, etc., Webb has a ready response. For such answers to solve the Fermi paradox, he says, they have to apply to every single ETC. Surely, he posits, not all ETCs would have such a psychology. But, by taking all such solutions and playing an elimination game similar to the one Webb plays on pages 237-239, we can reverse his conclusion and eliminate all existing ETCs as non-communicative for one reason or another, arriving at the grand conclusion that we are not alone and that there are indeed a whole bunch of ETCs out there.I wish I had the space to address some other Stephen Webb arguments that I think are faulty, but perhaps just one more will be suggestive. On page 229, while arguing that only humans have symbolic language, he relates an experiment in which a dolphin learns to operate an apparatus to release food. The dolphin is timed. Then the scientists close that dolphin off and release a second dolphin into the pool with the apparatus. The first dolphin can send signals to the second dolphin. The scientists then time how long it takes for the second dolphin to learn to work the apparatus. They discover that it takes the second dolphin on average just as long as it did the first. Webb writes: ""We can conclude from this that the first dolphin was unable to tell the second dolphin how the apparatus worked.""Well, maybe. But replace the dolphins with humans, and the reward of food with hundred dollar bills, and perhaps we might conclude that humans are also unable to communicate how the apparatus worked!Bottom line: for SETI enthusiasts and anyone interested in the prospect of extraterrestrial life, this is a book, despite its flaws, not to be missed. --Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is"""

4,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89242656-diana,4,"If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens…Where is Everybody?: Seventy-Five Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life [2015] – ★★★★1/2 I am continuing with my Non-Fiction November Reading Challenge with this curious book on the Fermi paradox. This paradox states that, if there are billions of stars out there in galaxies, and they are similar to and much older than our Sun, there is a high probability that those distant systems have planets that resemble our planet Earth. In turn, the typical nature of our planet means life must have developed and accelerated on other planets too, and, if beings there developed interstellar travel, they should have visited Earth already (or at least sent their probes). The paradox is that we do not see/perceive any extraterrestrial activity. Dr Stephen Webb is a theoretical physicist who proposes and discusses seventy-five solutions to the Fermi paradox in this book, solutions which he divides into three sections: (i) Alien Are (or Were) Here; (ii) Aliens Exist, but We Have Yet to See or Hear from Them; and (iii) Aliens Do Not Exist. This is an enjoyable, mentally-stimulating book that impresses with the number and diversity of different solutions and theories that may explain the Fermi Paradox. It is important to note from the outset that, although the book indulges in speculations on science, the topic of this book is not some kind of easily dismissible pseudo-science, but a perfectly scientific question that have been posed by serious scientists, including by Stephen Hawking. The paradox itself is named after Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist and a Nobel Prize Winner, who came up with the proposition after a series of laborious calculations that left him to conclude that we should have been visited by extraterrestrials a long time ago. I will obviously not describe each of the seventy-five solutions proposed, but will comment and share my thoughts on some of the more convincing or interesting ones under each heading of the book.I. Extraterrestrials Are or Were Here In this section of the book, Stephen Webb provides ten solutions and most of them border fantasy, such as theories that aliens are watching us from UFOs or that we are aliens. It is true that there was much publicity in the past about Kenneth Arnold’s sighing of an UFO in 1947 or about the Roswell UFO incident, but there is no hard evidence so far to substantiate these claims or prove the existence of extraterrestrial life. Given this, the belief that God exists is probably the most convincing argument in this section of the book.II. Extraterrestrials Exist, but We Have Yet to See or Hear from ThemThis line of reasoning is the most convincing one in the book and it is the most popular theory among scientists. In this section, Webb explores solutions to the Fermi paradox that revolve around the idea that aliens are signalling, but we are not receiving their signal for some reason. He also explores theories that stars may be too far away or intelligence is not permanent. One of the convincing solutions in this section is that advanced civilisations have simply become too inward-looking, rather than driven by exploration and a colonist mentality. That is why we do not see their presence in our solar system. I think that, given that human beings already “live in the Internet”, it is not too far-fetched to suggest that advanced civilisations on other planets are information-driven, and may be living in an artificial reality. They may have different values than us, having moved beyond exploitive and colonist worldviews.Another hint on a solution that I found convincing in this section is that, galaxies may be swarming with alien civilisations, but “differences in age, abilities, physicality, etc. might lead to a qualitative difference between our minds and theirs…[resulting in] communication being impossible” [Webb, 2015: 196]. Clement Vidal, a Belgian physicist, also proposed that aliens might have already learnt now to manipulate energy from stars and space-time, not to mention them having different mathematics or being capable of manipulating molecules and atoms [2015: 197]. They may know the secrets of the universe and have a perfect control over the mind, space and time. This means that they may be simply too advanced or different from us to make any contact. I also believe that we may be simply too different to even recognise what they are – us understanding or imagining them is like a cat being able to understand all the concepts in a philosophy book or a prehistoric man imagining a game played on an iPad. Humans are also confined to their senses and consciousness, and we cannot see the world through another apparatus than a human brain. Also, given that the universe is thirteen billion years old, humans may simply have not listened long enough for any signals since, given the universe time-frame, the intelligent life has only been on the planet some seconds out of one hundred years universal time.III. Extraterrestrials Do Not ExistThis section of the book also has some convincing arguments because we still do not know how special our planet is and how unique is life. Moreover, questions remain as to how unique consciousness and intelligence development are. It will only be possible to say for certain that extraterrestrials do not exist if we first answer this question – how precisely life started on Earth? There is still no definite answer to this question. Thus, in this section of the book, the author talks about such solutions to the paradox as “planetary systems are rare”, “planetary systems are too dangerous to live in”, “life’s genesis is rare”, “our moon is unique” and “high technology is not inevitable”. Exoplanets that have conditions that are similar to Earth are already said to exist, even though another argument is that “conditions on Earth have simply been too right” [Webb, 2015: 291]. Perhaps, there are conditions on other planets that make it possible for other life forms to emerge, life forms that do not need perfect-for-life-on-Earth conditions.The unfortunate aspect of If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens is that it goes for breadth, rather than depth; the author is quick to dismiss theories that he personally finds ludicrous; and all the quotations that begin each solution come off as more unnecessarily pretentious, rather than insightful or helpful. Webb’s own solution at the end of the book is odd. It is like the author is trying to say: “I wrote a book on the Fermi paradox, proposing all these solutions, but I don’t believe in the paradox in the first place and do not think it should even exist”.It is clear from reading this book that we still know very little to answer seriously such a big question as – do extraterrestrials exist? As Stephen Webb put it: “we have little idea about the nature of dark matter…and dark energy is a complete mystery….and we are still to reconcile gravity with quantum theory” [2015: 186]. If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens provides both more or less serious and science-fiction solutions to the paradox, and is really one mind-boggling journey into one of the mysteries of the universe that echoes the mystery of our own planetary existence."
5,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9414159-quinton,2,"I loved the premise of this book so much, but the execution fell a bit flat for me.Why? I think it was just because the author takes a sort of detached and tedious elaboration of all the different possibilities so that it fills a whole book. I would have preferred something with more pop and pizazz. Give the big picture summary, then break out the key parts, wrestle with the parts and try to really engage with the arguments to highlight the strengths and weaknesses. Instead, it seemed kind of dry and passive. The whole ""50 solutions"" is a bit misleading too.The premise is still great though and no one else thought to write a book on this topic so the author deserves credit for being the first to address the topic. I just felt like he didn't really tackle it in a satisfying or definitive way and perhaps someone can still come along later and do just that. And to be fair it's a sort of slippery problem where we don't exact have definitive data yet so there's probably only so much that we can expect."
6,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,5,"5I had never heard of the Fermi Paradox prior to reading this book, but by the end it really puts a lot of the UFO conspiracies and evolutionary idea's into perspective. This is not an Alien book. I will get this out there as soon as possible to ensure everybody looking at this book knows that. This is an interesting look into the idea that just maybe, we are very lonely in this universe. Who honestly knows. Stephen Webb has created a great book that asks all the questions and answers most of them as well. The book is split into various number structures so at one point you use these as chapter points. The book is full of investigations and if you're a believer of Alien life, this book will fit nicely into your world. I had once thought that maybe the universe is full of life and that one day mankind would reach the stars and join into the scheme of things. Sadly this book gives you a solid gut punch and the realities of just how likely or unlikely life outside Earth will be. How often have you heard about UFO sightings? A lot yeah. The one thing that is puzzling is the fact they haven't bothered to make contact. These are the types of questions that you should be asking. Stephen Webb should take another look back into this book and setup a sequel of sorts with what it is like now. It would be a shorter book to say the least, but a lot is happening in the world of science since the publication of this book. This is why reading science books from the last 10 to 20 years is a tough act, so much has now changed. Technology is going to be the key to reversing the devastation mankind has caused on this Earth, mainly the raising of CO2 levels to dangerously crazy levels. Consider it has now been 10000 years since the last ice age and that the Earth was riddled with Dinosaurs for millions of years. What if, and this is a huge what if, Aliens visited and noticed that there was no intelligent life. Why would they come back?Why the 5?The concluding chapter is incredible, it is a must read for everyone. If you check out the hash tag on Instagram in a few weeks I'll be writing the very last paragraph. When I suggest Webb should write a sequel, it is based on the whole evolution of man that has now been linked to the 150000 year mark of the y chromosome. So much has now been discovered. The next 100 years will be insane. There is going to be discovery and the colonisation of Mars. We now have the capabilities to alter our own DNA, that will ensure safe space travel, something that was a huge risk. Webb covers so much in this book and it is worth reading, just to learn what have been our errors for attempting first contact and what other books you should be reading. Fermi is a name I came across with Cosmos, and now I understand so much more. In a modern world of corporations and capitalism, we tend to forget our bigger purpose in life is exploration. I enjoyed how the book hits on points about our humanity and lack of it. Take the gamble and check it out, well worth the read and very relevant. "
7,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I started this book with a sense of foreboding. The subtitle is 'Seventy-five solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life'. Any premise based on giving 75 different answers to the same question - in this case, effectively 'Where are the aliens?' - sounds like a trainspotter of a book. A title that is obsessed with collecting every possible viewpoint, over and above any value that can be gained from reading it. However, the first proper chapter, giving some background to the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, and the 'where is everybody' paradox that it is named after him, reassured me hugely, as it was entertaining and well written.I can honestly say that if Stephen Webb had continued in this vein and had written a book about the Fermi paradox and its possible solutions in the same narrative style as his chapter on Fermi and the origins of the paradox, I would have given this book four to five stars. That chapter demonstrated just how well Webb can write. But the format of 75 'different' solutions lets him down. By about the 12 mark, the whole thing was getting a trifle samey. And by solution 20, I was skip reading, searching for interesting bits.The book has a lovely range and covers many fascinating topics - for example, it went from Bayes' theorem to stone axe manufacturing in a few pages - but the constant return to yet another solution to the Fermi paradox gets, frankly, boring. Structured as a continuous narrative, the content of this book would have been excellent, but as 75 bitty 'solutions' it just doesn't work very well. This proved particularly irritating when Webb goes through all the different reasons why life could be rare in the universe, and says at the end of each, over and over variants on 'but of itself, this is probably not enough to justify the conclusion.' I found myself wanting to throw the book against the wall and scream 'But why should it be taken by itself? Why not combine the solutions?' .... And then Webb cheats and does exactly that in his own 'solution', number 75.This was so near an excellent piece of popular science (I'm not really sure why it's part of Springer's 'Science and Fiction' series, as it merely references ideas from SF, but the majority of popular science books do that), just let down by the structure. I'd also say that the publisher is making a mistake pricing the book as if it were an academic title: it's more expensive than any normal hardback popular science title, let alone a paperback."
8,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27247551-b-lint,5,"Absolutely fascinating read. The author compiled an enormous amount of special knowledge into this book for the general reader. The solutions are intriguing and I've learned about a ton of new things: canonical artefact, waterhole, genetics, ramjet, panspermia and a lot more. The explanations are quite clear and I was able to follow along. My only issue with the book was that, by his own admission, the author did the typesetting which is quite lame, as special characters, equations and such are images - consequently don't show up in my highlights. I can live with this though. Highly-highly recommended for any thinker. "
9,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17159378-ingvaras,4,"What I loved most about this book was the breadth of material in it and all the various references to sci-fi stories, papers, biographies, and textbooks. It is a popular science book, so it doesn’t go too deep into the details of most things. Dr Webb tries his best to explain things plainly, which sometimes can feel kind of cringy if you’re knowledgeable about the topic. But for the most part, it’s quite enjoyable, even if you knew the theories and facts before. I guess this makes it well-written.Personally, I think the parts to do with biology were quite a bit more involved than anything else in this book, but everything was still understandable (intuitively, at least). Although maybe it’s just me not having enough experience with these topics.The author goes a little in-depth on every solution (explaining certain things that a casual reader wouldn’t know) and in doing so, he provides all the references to the source materials, historic context, the names and so on. Makes it feel a lot more sciency! While reading I made a bunch of notes - just things and people to look up later and filled my goodreads' ""Want to read"" section with quite a few books. Of course, you're bound to disagree with some of the proposed solutions, so from time to time I just found myself low-key thinking ""just get on with it!"".This book can be really inspiring. I haven’t read a popular science book in a while, and this one really managed to boost my curiosity and excitement about science and ~~SPACE~~! This is why I’m giving this book... 4⭐"

My chief complaint is that Webb is tremendously biased towards technological optimism. He describes some of the arguments why interstellar travel and colonization may be so overwhelmingly difficult and expensive as to be completely infeasible... and Webb goes ""nah, I'm sure we'll solve all that"". I was hoping for a deeper analysis of the feasibility of interstellar travel, but Webb skirts past it. There are many other good things in the book, though."

The author, and in 338 pages, checks 75 anwers to the question: Why haven't we heared anything from aliens, where are they..?? If the universe is immensly huge, and if the conditions that helped life to develop on earth, should also exist in some other planets, and end up with advanced technological creatures like us, the humans. So, if we assume that such conditions should have existed for a long time out there in many places of the universe, and with the fact that there are hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy aline, and that also there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe, so some people would argue that the conclusion must be, (the universe should br teaming with other creatures, just like us). But, ""Where are they, why we haven't heared from them"".The author in this book gives 75 answers to this question. He takes you in a trip to a world of many many weird possibilities, and many ideas you didn't even think of. He has a vast knowledge about the latest discussions and scientific developments in this regard. And in the last few pages he gives his own thought about his own idea about this matter, which was almost a shock for me ( I will not mention it; not to spoil it). This book is a (Must read) for every one."

The book is packed with relevant information, and it is put to good use. If you want to refresh your memories about the aforementioned topics, then you would not be dissapointed.Great feature of the book is also authors take on popular science fiction and its explanations of the topic. There are several interesting books and stories mentioned that I will seek reading in the future.I don't give this book five stars, because it is a little outdated, which is its only disadvantage - but it is not authors fault, but rather fast development of cosmic observation which allow us to see that there are probably many exoplanets (one was just found today, 100 light years from us)."

Some these civilizations must be millions of years older than us on Earth, so surely should have developed the capability to communicate and travel through from star to star and galaxy to galaxy. But we haven't heard from or seen anybody else. Where is everybody?This a big and provocative question that has scientific, philosophical, and religious implications. Webb breaks the question down by posing 50 possible solutions to this paradox. He brings in concepts from physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, history, geology, science fiction, sociology, cognition, and engineering. To think about this question involves the combination of so many disciplines, and that's why it's so very intriguing. Not only that, our best answers are at the frontiers of most of these fields of knowledge. So, in this book you get a whirlwind tour of the biggest thinking, cutting edge, and open questions in so many different areas. I recommend this book to science lovers and science fiction lovers.Webb's structure takes a big getting used to. It can be repetitive at times, as he's tried to make each potential solution self-contained (as he states in the introduction). I read the book straight through.I found the book to be thoughtful, well researched, and thought provoking. It had reviews of basic science, which came off a big elementary (as if Webb had just reviewed a college 101 textbook and parroted back information [he is not an expert in evolutionary biology, for example]).Some of my favorite ideas are: Berserkers which are self-replicated robots that can quickly consume a galaxy; the singularity hits and human life, creativity, and curiosity is no longer necessary, civilizations are destroyed; and that ""perhaps it is possible to develop a mathematical system based upon the concepts of shape and size, rather than numbers."" I like that Webb can be creative at times. At other times, I found his repetitiveness about not being creative enough to get old quickly."
18,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4502505-swapnil-bokade,4,"50 years ago the great Enrico Fermi posed this question to 3 other physicists while out on lunch, "" where is everybody?"" Which is known as Fermi Paradox now. The crux of the paradox is as follows. Given there are so many billion stars and so many billion planets, if we follow the principle of mediocrity which says there's nothing special about life on earth and it can evolve anywhere given the right conditions, there should be an awfully large number of civilizations capable of communicating with us. So the question is why don't we see signs of intelligence anywhere else at all? The author has collected various ideas, theories or hypotheses which attempt to explain this Big Silence in this book. The book is divided into three sections 1. Alien are already here 2.aliens exist but haven't communicated 3. Aliens don't exist. The author himself tends to support the 3 group. He argues that given the vast number of parameters that are fine tuned for life on earth to have evolved it is highly unlikely that we would find another place where all theseParameters have been so similarly tuned. This idea had been explored much more in depth in book called Rare Earth which is also a good read on the topic. Personally I tend to disagree with this pessimistic view which says we are alone but since we have absolutely nothing in data to argue in one way or other this is as good a theory to support as any other. This book introduced me to some really novel explanations for the paradox like Von Neumann probes , zoo hypothesis or interdict scenario. All in all a really interesting read."
19,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164723-joshua-hedlund,4,"Discusses history of Fermi Paradox and fifty representative solutions. Life seems to have arisen soon after life-supporting environment developed on earth. But if it's that easy for life to arise naturally, why haven't we seen any others?1. Helped me appreciate why many solutions that seem initially reasonable are unsatisfying when you investigate them. Yes, stars are far away, but within our own Galaxy, if intelligent life arose somewhere else a billion years earlier, even fairly conservative assumptions should have galaxy colonized in a hundred million years. Sociological arguments (ex. They don't want to explore, they're hiding out of caution, etc) require *every* other civilization to behave that way. Even ""virtual"" addicts would still eventually have to outrun the death of their star.2. Helped me appreciate how long-term life actually requires *more* fine-tuning than young-earth creationism. Introduced me to concept of the *continuously* habitable zone.3. Found it interesting that the breadth of solutions never seriously considered the possibility that the Christian God deliberately created life. Even seeded/alien type solutions assume a natural initial origin.Fun easy read that covers a lot of science, primarily astronomy but many related topics as well."
20,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This book discusses in the detail the decades-old ""Fermi paradox"" -- if the universe is so congenial to the formation and evolution of life, then where are all of these other civilization? Webb presents a list of 50 proposed ""solutions"" to the paradox, including: (a) societies lose interest in space exploration and colonization; (b) societies invariably destroy themselves before they venture out; (c) there is a ""galactic ethic"" that civilizations not disclose their existence to nascent civilizations such as ours; (d) space travel is impossibly difficult; and (e) colonization would take too long. Webb analyzes each of these ""explanations"", and then presents his own conclusion -- there are no extraterrestrial societies; we are literally the first, at least within the confines of the Milky Way. I personally feel this is a very significant question. This is a very good reference to unravel the mystery."
21,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7422577-francesco,4,"Very interesting book, full of brilliant ideas across multiple fields! Trying to answering to the Fermi paradox (on why we didn't meet extraterrestrial intelligent forms of lives yet or the Great Silence), the author shares with us brilliant ideas on the evolution of our galaxy, of our solar system, of our planet and on terrestrial life in itself.Particularly insightful the last chapters, where Webb explains the exceptionality of the transition from mono-cellular to multi-cellular life and the peculiarity of humans being the only species out of 50 billions to enjoy language, being language a necessary ingredient of an Intelligent life.The only negative point of the book is that the first part, dedicated to why ETIs already contacted us or not, is the least interesting one. So you need to get to the second half of the book to read the best pages."
22,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79700-chris-lugo,5,This is one of the most interesting books I have read in some time. It is an easy read for the non-scientific types but addresses one of the most important questions I think people can consider at this moment in our cultural development. Unfortunately I think that I agree with the conclusions of the author that perhaps intelligent life in the universie is exceedingly rare.

27,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,4,"The simple formulations of Fermi's paradox seem very compelling. There are countless stars in countless galaxies in the universe. We now know that planets are very common around those stars. We even have good reason to believe that the basic building blocks of life are abundant among those stars and planets. Surely, out there, what happened here on our planet has happened elsewhere -- the development of intelligent life and a technological civilization. In fact, there should be civilizations much older than our own, given the age of the universe and the age of the stars and galaxies in it. So why haven't we detected or even just stumbled upon any evidence of the existence of those civilizations? As Fermi said, ""Where is everybody?""Evidence could come in the form of anything from actual visitations to detection of artificial signals -- radio signals or other sorts. But, UFO enthusiasts and such aside, we have no solid evidence of any sort.Webb is gripped by Fermi's question and discusses, usually briefly, 50 solutions -- 49, plus his own -- to the paradox.The first set of solutions discuss the possibility that, in fact, extraterrestrial civilizations do exist and are in some sense ""here"", hiding or observing or the like. The second set explores the idea that they exist, but have not communicated or visited. And the third set discusses the possibility, depressing to some, that they just don't exist.Many, many of the solutions could be books in and of themselves (and some have been). The price for the scope of Webb's discussion is the brevity of his treatment of each of the solutions. I have to admit I was growing a bit weary as I read through one after another, building up more and more unfinished answers.But Webb's final chapter, his own solution, saved the day for me. What he does there is a kind of reversal of the famous Drake equation. The Drake equation purports to compute the number of likely civilizations, based on a relatively small set of factors -- rate of star formation, percentage of stars having planets, likelihood of life developing, etc. on up to the average lifetime of a civilization capable of communication. Compared to when Drake first formulated the equation in 1961, we know much more about the factors in the equation, both their values and the subvariables that complicate computing them. It's gotten messier, in a good way, and the Drake equation may seem out-dated, but there is plenty of room for optimism about the number of civilizations that should be out there.What Webb does is take an estimate of the number of planets in our own galaxy and then apply a succession of filters to winnow that number down, eliminating percentages for planets that orbit too close to their stars, that orbit very short-lived stars, that may not have protective radiation belts like our own, or suitable atmospheres, and so on. He combines many of the factors he has discussed among the 49 previous solutions to arrive at a compelling argument that the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations isn't really so surprising at all -- what happened here, when you look in detail, isn't so likely to have happened elsewhere at all.I have to say, I feel more strongly pulled toward that ""pessimistic"" conclusion after having read Webb's book. It's not that life seems improbable, but life with our peculiar characteristics -- the adaptation we call intelligence, the specific form our intelligence takes, our specific ways of communicating and making our presence known, the very things we are prepared to understand as signs of ""intelligence"" . . . All of these things, when each is considered by itself, seem fragile.The universe no doubt contains unimaginable things -- a tremendous diversity of environments in which who knows what has developed or evolved. What has happened here may just be one thing that can happen in that immeasurable diversity -- there's nothing that compels nature to produce intelligent civilizations, no directionality that would favor or drive towards it. In that largest scheme of things, intelligent civilizations may be a blip (or two or three). If you want to look more on the optimistic side, that diversity may be more exciting to explore than the discovery of others like ourselves."
28,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2998430-david,5,"Although I have known about the Fermi paradox for a long time, it was quite recently it grew in importance for me when I got interested in existential risks or threats against the whole humanity. Maybe, I thought, the answer to the Fermi paradox is that all advanced civilizations obliterate themselves with some advanced physical experiment? Well, that is one of the solutions Webb discusses in this book with 75 solutions (the first edition has 50 solutions and the new edition has 75). After some brief discussion about Fermi and the origin of the paradox and the so called Drake equation, the solutions are grouped into three parts: 1. They Are (or Were) Here, 2. They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear from Them and 3. They Don’t Exist. He doesn't give a lot of credence to solutions which argue aliens are already here (and for most of them rightfully so), so it is quite a bit sorter than the other two sections with only ten chapters. The second tier of solutions are those where the aliens do exist, but we haven't observed them. Many of these solutions are more akin to science fiction than science. But it is a fun walk-through on Dyson spheres, colonizing patterns, the Kardashev scale, whether highly advanced aliens would be more likely to hang out near the center of the galaxy using all the energy there or rather be in the most cold regions to make possible the maximum efficiency for calculations, etc. Some of these solutions are quite extraordinary, but it makes for a great read. And the third set of solutions all argue (intelligent) aliens doesn't exist or at least are very rare. Here Webb leave the science fiction and go to science. Habitable zones for planets, the importance of our moon to keep the earth stable, the development of life and a few of the big hurdles on the way to a species which can ponder where the aliens are and more is discussed. As a non-scientist I thought it was both quite easy to follow Webb's explanations and very rewarding. For anyone interested in the Fermi paradox I can't think of a better place to start than this book. Highly recommended!"
29,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21350454-njay,4,"I'm obsessed with the search for extraterrestrials (first-contact stories are one of my favorite sci-fi genres), so I had to read this. It's a very thoughtful analysis of the Fermi paradox: in a big universe where there are surely other planets that have the potential to foster life, why have we not heard from or seen a single extraterrestrial civilization (ETC) yet?I admire how Webb attempts to answer this question in the final chapter (I won't spoil it here) after methodically working his way through the list of other possibilities, including the ""zoo hypothesis"" and other fun ones that have been explored in science fiction stories, TV shows, and movies. His conclusion is what will stick with me the most about this book. It has changed how I think about ETCs.This book isn't a light read, but it's written for a lay audience and I would compare it to Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" -- it challenges a reader but not in an intimidating way. I especially liked the deep dive Webb takes into cellular biology. He walks you through DNA and other topics you read about in the news frequently but which I'll admit I hadn't really pondered since high school biology many years ago.I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a smart read and wanting to ponder our place in the universe."

The first three chapters were easy to read but once you get into the scientific bits you have to really focus to get anything out of it, I could barely do more than one solution per sitting. There’s no story, it’s just a pure collection of hard science facts applied to find a solution to the question of life out there in the universe.It’s super fascinating, and I loved it! The parts about possible Type II or III Civilisations with self replicating probes and communication technologies and languages far beyond our understanding were my favourites. Also it was amazing to read about natural science history and exactly how lucky a species we are to be where we are. I mean, it’s incredible how we’ve come here, how the moon formed perfectly, how our planet and the atmosphere came about, how we don’t get frozen or burned to death and how we survive in this very dangerous galaxy.Even if it can be very frustrating that we’ve never heard from aliens, I’m staying optimistic. We probably won’t see or hear anything in our lifetimes, but we’ll get there."

Each of them is clearly stated and kept simple (without too much details). Additionally there are plenty of references to other books and scientific studies if one wants to learn more about a specific subject. I would have liked to read a few more ""solutions"" around the theme of the multiverse, parallel universes and recent work in theoretical physics (string theory for example) that could have enlarged even more the range of possible resolutions for the Fermi paradox. But maybe the reason of the omission is the lack of data and evidence about these two domains? Or perhaps the field is too complicated to be explained in simple terms and hence be presented in this book. Anyway it is definitely worth a read if you've ever caught yourself thinking: ""How can we be alone in the universe? Where is everybody?"""

I wasn't a stellar (hehehe) student, but the readings have stuck with me, especially Carl Sagan's book on the probability of other life in the universe. I'm also grateful for Prof. Greg Rozenberg's patient review of DNA basics (so I could understand the concept of using DNA as massive parallel processing computers).

52,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
53,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

Solutions, I think, is the wrong word. Possible explanations would probably have fit a great deal better. Either way, you can have a general idea of what the book is about before you pick it up: the universe is big and if there are aliens, we should know where they are by now, or at least that they exist.The book begins with an enjoyable mini-biography on Enrico Fermi, an explanation of the concept of a paradox, and then a detailed description of the Fermi Paradox itself. From there, we do in fact get 75 possible explanations of why we haven’t found aliens yet.Mr. Webb breaks these 75 explanations into four categories.•	They Are (Were) Here (10)•	They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear From Them (40)•	They Don’t Exist (24)•	The Right Solution (1)In each category, we’re introduced to explanations one at a time with an apparently thoughtful treatment of exactly what the explanation is and entails, and then a sometimes thoughtful and sometimes dismissive period of knocking it down. There are the UFO enthusiast theories, a large number of variations on “space is big” and all the different ways aliens could be colonizing the universe, all the things that could go wrong for a society confined to one planet, all the reasons why we could actually be alone, and the right answer.Some of the solutions are entertaining, some are laughable (and no always in a good way), and some are actually treated with scientific rigor. Of course, some are also treated with disdain.And then there’s the author’s solution, which is basically that we don’t know enough yet to be able to decide if it’s something we can know or find out yet.Overall rating: 3 stars. I’m not sure what I expected when I picked up the book, but what I got was a sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes eye rolling critic of 74 thoughts on where all the aliens are. The author stood every “solution” up only to knock it down, but I think I would have liked more science and fewer conspiracy theories. Actually, I probably would have given it an extra star."

Almost makes me wish I hadn't skipped that physics class back in high school. Having weaseled my way out of any extra classes involving numbers, however, I can report that this book manages to be informative and lightly technical in spots without going over the head of this math-illiterate Classics major. I was originally put on to this book by Canadian futurist, ethicist, and animal rights advocate George Dvorsky, who listed it among his favorites. Since his work is always crazy interesting, I figured I couldn't go too far wrong following his recommendations. By collecting an illustrative range of solutions to the Fermi Paradox in one volume, this book makes a valuable contribution to popular science, where the interest-rich, but theory-impoverished like myself gather crumbs.A couple of articles I've read recently pertain to the subject: This 2012 Newsweek article on the concept of the multiverse dovetails with Solution #8, particularly the third idea of black holes and the creation of universes on pages 57-59: http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek....

My primary issue is with the author's lack of imagination and rather irritating tendency to dismiss ideas without explaining why he's doing so.

82,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
83,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

85,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,3,"The subtitle of the book is important as well: Seventy-Five Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life. Solutions, I think, is the wrong word. Possible explanations would probably have fit a great deal better. Either way, you can have a general idea of what the book is about before you pick it up: the universe is big and if there are aliens, we should know where they are by now, or at least that they exist.The book begins with an enjoyable mini-biography on Enrico Fermi, an explanation of the concept of a paradox, and then a detailed description of the Fermi Paradox itself. From there, we do in fact get 75 possible explanations of why we haven’t found aliens yet.Mr. Webb breaks these 75 explanations into four categories.•	They Are (Were) Here (10)•	They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear From Them (40)•	They Don’t Exist (24)•	The Right Solution (1)In each category, we’re introduced to explanations one at a time with an apparently thoughtful treatment of exactly what the explanation is and entails, and then a sometimes thoughtful and sometimes dismissive period of knocking it down. There are the UFO enthusiast theories, a large number of variations on “space is big” and all the different ways aliens could be colonizing the universe, all the things that could go wrong for a society confined to one planet, all the reasons why we could actually be alone, and the right answer.Some of the solutions are entertaining, some are laughable (and no always in a good way), and some are actually treated with scientific rigor. Of course, some are also treated with disdain.And then there’s the author’s solution, which is basically that we don’t know enough yet to be able to decide if it’s something we can know or find out yet.Overall rating: 3 stars. I’m not sure what I expected when I picked up the book, but what I got was a sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes eye rolling critic of 74 thoughts on where all the aliens are. The author stood every “solution” up only to knock it down, but I think I would have liked more science and fewer conspiracy theories. Actually, I probably would have given it an extra star."

112,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
113,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

115,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,3,"The subtitle of the book is important as well: Seventy-Five Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life. Solutions, I think, is the wrong word. Possible explanations would probably have fit a great deal better. Either way, you can have a general idea of what the book is about before you pick it up: the universe is big and if there are aliens, we should know where they are by now, or at least that they exist.The book begins with an enjoyable mini-biography on Enrico Fermi, an explanation of the concept of a paradox, and then a detailed description of the Fermi Paradox itself. From there, we do in fact get 75 possible explanations of why we haven’t found aliens yet.Mr. Webb breaks these 75 explanations into four categories.•	They Are (Were) Here (10)•	They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear From Them (40)•	They Don’t Exist (24)•	The Right Solution (1)In each category, we’re introduced to explanations one at a time with an apparently thoughtful treatment of exactly what the explanation is and entails, and then a sometimes thoughtful and sometimes dismissive period of knocking it down. There are the UFO enthusiast theories, a large number of variations on “space is big” and all the different ways aliens could be colonizing the universe, all the things that could go wrong for a society confined to one planet, all the reasons why we could actually be alone, and the right answer.Some of the solutions are entertaining, some are laughable (and no always in a good way), and some are actually treated with scientific rigor. Of course, some are also treated with disdain.And then there’s the author’s solution, which is basically that we don’t know enough yet to be able to decide if it’s something we can know or find out yet.Overall rating: 3 stars. I’m not sure what I expected when I picked up the book, but what I got was a sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes eye rolling critic of 74 thoughts on where all the aliens are. The author stood every “solution” up only to knock it down, but I think I would have liked more science and fewer conspiracy theories. Actually, I probably would have given it an extra star."

117,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10672905-sonia-wilson,5,"Very neat book for anyone interested in astronomy, physics, or paradoxes! Almost makes me wish I hadn't skipped that physics class back in high school. Having weaseled my way out of any extra classes involving numbers, however, I can report that this book manages to be informative and lightly technical in spots without going over the head of this math-illiterate Classics major. I was originally put on to this book by Canadian futurist, ethicist, and animal rights advocate George Dvorsky, who listed it among his favorites. Since his work is always crazy interesting, I figured I couldn't go too far wrong following his recommendations. By collecting an illustrative range of solutions to the Fermi Paradox in one volume, this book makes a valuable contribution to popular science, where the interest-rich, but theory-impoverished like myself gather crumbs.A couple of articles I've read recently pertain to the subject: This 2012 Newsweek article on the concept of the multiverse dovetails with Solution #8, particularly the third idea of black holes and the creation of universes on pages 57-59: http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek.... This NPR article from 2013 about the emerging uniqueness of our own solar system fits into section number 3 of the book, in particular Solutions #37 and #35: http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/201...."
118,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,3,"I'd heard about this book for a while and, while I'm glad to have read it and I did find it interesting, it left me a bit underwhelmed. My primary issue is with the author's lack of imagination and rather irritating tendency to dismiss ideas without explaining why he's doing so. Several of the entries are wrapped up with, essentially, ""This is a very compelling resolution to Fermi's Paradox, but I'm not convinced""; if you set out to explain why proposed solutions to a conundrum do or don't work, then you need to demonstrate why said solutions do or don't hold-simply saying you do/don't buy it isn't good enough. Barring that rather annoying tendency, Webb does a marvelous job of covering the topic (albeit not exhaustively), delving into detail where needed and giving most of the proffered solutions the treatment they're due. His own conclusion is reasoned well, though I'm not sure I agree with it, primarily because Webb makes quite a few assumptions about the base-line criteria for intelligent life that, while reasonable and certainly applicable where we're concerned, may not be absolutely applicable to intelligent life everywhere. Still, great book on the subject and an excellent source of brain candy to chew on."
119,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201264-anthony,4,"I think the author does a great job laying out many different types of arguments which attempt to answer the Fermi Paradox, knowing fully well that most of those arguments aren’t even refutable using the scientific methods, given our existing technology and data. The strength of this book doesn’t lie in the way the author clinically tries to agree or disagree with each hypothesis (a better word might be “speculation”, since the hypothesis is not testable), but the way in which he introduces and explains each one of them. I especially liked his elaboration on how the appearance and the subsequent development of life might be an extremely low probability event, more so than people appreciate; perhaps low enough to offset the reducio ad absurdum argument - “but sir, that is absurd, there are billions upon billions of stars out there”. Personally, I am very interested in the SETI program, and my thought is that the Fermi Paradox would gain more attention and debate as the” great silence” continues. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to get ready in the event that discussion heat up and brush up on the multiple approaches to the paradox. "
120,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"Yeah, I made it! That was a very interesting, hard and thought provoking read. The first three chapters were easy to read but once you get into the scientific bits you have to really focus to get anything out of it, I could barely do more than one solution per sitting. There’s no story, it’s just a pure collection of hard science facts applied to find a solution to the question of life out there in the universe.It’s super fascinating, and I loved it! The parts about possible Type II or III Civilisations with self replicating probes and communication technologies and languages far beyond our understanding were my favourites. Also it was amazing to read about natural science history and exactly how lucky a species we are to be where we are. I mean, it’s incredible how we’ve come here, how the moon formed perfectly, how our planet and the atmosphere came about, how we don’t get frozen or burned to death and how we survive in this very dangerous galaxy.Even if it can be very frustrating that we’ve never heard from aliens, I’m staying optimistic. We probably won’t see or hear anything in our lifetimes, but we’ll get there."
121,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51034634-jeremy,5,"The book presents an exhaustive list of simple and more elaborate solutions to the Fermi paradox. Each of them is clearly stated and kept simple (without too much details). Additionally there are plenty of references to other books and scientific studies if one wants to learn more about a specific subject. I would have liked to read a few more ""solutions"" around the theme of the multiverse, parallel universes and recent work in theoretical physics (string theory for example) that could have enlarged even more the range of possible resolutions for the Fermi paradox. But maybe the reason of the omission is the lack of data and evidence about these two domains? Or perhaps the field is too complicated to be explained in simple terms and hence be presented in this book. Anyway it is definitely worth a read if you've ever caught yourself thinking: ""How can we be alone in the universe? Where is everybody?"""

Of my many college classics over way too many years, the Astro-GeoPhysics class I took from Prof. Kim Malville at CU Boulder is one that has had lasting impact. I wasn't a stellar (hehehe) student, but the readings have stuck with me, especially Carl Sagan's book on the probability of other life in the universe. I'm also grateful for Prof. Greg Rozenberg's patient review of DNA basics (so I could understand the concept of using DNA as massive parallel processing computers).

Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

I'm also grateful for Prof. Greg Rozenberg's patient review of DNA basics (so I could understand the concept of using DNA as massive parallel processing computers).

172,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
173,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable.

202,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
203,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

205,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,3,"The subtitle of the book is important as well: Seventy-Five Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life. Solutions, I think, is the wrong word. Possible explanations would probably have fit a great deal better. Either way, you can have a general idea of what the book is about before you pick it up: the universe is big and if there are aliens, we should know where they are by now, or at least that they exist.The book begins with an enjoyable mini-biography on Enrico Fermi, an explanation of the concept of a paradox, and then a detailed description of the Fermi Paradox itself. From there, we do in fact get 75 possible explanations of why we haven’t found aliens yet.Mr. Webb breaks these 75 explanations into four categories.•	They Are (Were) Here (10)•	They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear From Them (40)•	They Don’t Exist (24)•	The Right Solution (1)In each category, we’re introduced to explanations one at a time with an apparently thoughtful treatment of exactly what the explanation is and entails, and then a sometimes thoughtful and sometimes dismissive period of knocking it down. There are the UFO enthusiast theories, a large number of variations on “space is big” and all the different ways aliens could be colonizing the universe, all the things that could go wrong for a society confined to one planet, all the reasons why we could actually be alone, and the right answer.Some of the solutions are entertaining, some are laughable (and no always in a good way), and some are actually treated with scientific rigor. Of course, some are also treated with disdain.And then there’s the author’s solution, which is basically that we don’t know enough yet to be able to decide if it’s something we can know or find out yet.Overall rating: 3 stars. I’m not sure what I expected when I picked up the book, but what I got was a sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes eye rolling critic of 74 thoughts on where all the aliens are. The author stood every “solution” up only to knock it down, but I think I would have liked more science and fewer conspiracy theories. Actually, I probably would have given it an extra star."

207,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10672905-sonia-wilson,5,"Very neat book for anyone interested in astronomy, physics, or paradoxes! Almost makes me wish I hadn't skipped that physics class back in high school. Having weaseled my way out of any extra classes involving numbers, however, I can report that this book manages to be informative and lightly technical in spots without going over the head of this math-illiterate Classics major. I was originally put on to this book by Canadian futurist, ethicist, and animal rights advocate George Dvorsky, who listed it among his favorites. Since his work is always crazy interesting, I figured I couldn't go too far wrong following his recommendations. By collecting an illustrative range of solutions to the Fermi Paradox in one volume, this book makes a valuable contribution to popular science, where the interest-rich, but theory-impoverished like myself gather crumbs.A couple of articles I've read recently pertain to the subject: This 2012 Newsweek article on the concept of the multiverse dovetails with Solution #8, particularly the third idea of black holes and the creation of universes on pages 57-59: http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek.... This NPR article from 2013 about the emerging uniqueness of our own solar system fits into section number 3 of the book, in particular Solutions #37 and #35: http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/201...."
208,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,3,"I'd heard about this book for a while and, while I'm glad to have read it and I did find it interesting, it left me a bit underwhelmed. My primary issue is with the author's lack of imagination and rather irritating tendency to dismiss ideas without explaining why he's doing so. Several of the entries are wrapped up with, essentially, ""This is a very compelling resolution to Fermi's Paradox, but I'm not convinced""; if you set out to explain why proposed solutions to a conundrum do or don't work, then you need to demonstrate why said solutions do or don't hold-simply saying you do/don't buy it isn't good enough. Barring that rather annoying tendency, Webb does a marvelous job of covering the topic (albeit not exhaustively), delving into detail where needed and giving most of the proffered solutions the treatment they're due. His own conclusion is reasoned well, though I'm not sure I agree with it, primarily because Webb makes quite a few assumptions about the base-line criteria for intelligent life that, while reasonable and certainly applicable where we're concerned, may not be absolutely applicable to intelligent life everywhere. Still, great book on the subject and an excellent source of brain candy to chew on."
209,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201264-anthony,4,"I think the author does a great job laying out many different types of arguments which attempt to answer the Fermi Paradox, knowing fully well that most of those arguments aren’t even refutable using the scientific methods, given our existing technology and data. The strength of this book doesn’t lie in the way the author clinically tries to agree or disagree with each hypothesis (a better word might be “speculation”, since the hypothesis is not testable), but the way in which he introduces and explains each one of them. I especially liked his elaboration on how the appearance and the subsequent development of life might be an extremely low probability event, more so than people appreciate; perhaps low enough to offset the reducio ad absurdum argument - “but sir, that is absurd, there are billions upon billions of stars out there”. Personally, I am very interested in the SETI program, and my thought is that the Fermi Paradox would gain more attention and debate as the” great silence” continues. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to get ready in the event that discussion heat up and brush up on the multiple approaches to the paradox. "
210,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"Yeah, I made it! That was a very interesting, hard and thought provoking read. The first three chapters were easy to read but once you get into the scientific bits you have to really focus to get anything out of it, I could barely do more than one solution per sitting. There’s no story, it’s just a pure collection of hard science facts applied to find a solution to the question of life out there in the universe.It’s super fascinating, and I loved it! The parts about possible Type II or III Civilisations with self replicating probes and communication technologies and languages far beyond our understanding were my favourites. Also it was amazing to read about natural science history and exactly how lucky a species we are to be where we are. I mean, it’s incredible how we’ve come here, how the moon formed perfectly, how our planet and the atmosphere came about, how we don’t get frozen or burned to death and how we survive in this very dangerous galaxy.Even if it can be very frustrating that we’ve never heard from aliens, I’m staying optimistic. We probably won’t see or hear anything in our lifetimes, but we’ll get there."

232,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
233,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."

Solutions, I think, is the wrong word. Possible explanations would probably have fit a great deal better. Either way, you can have a general idea of what the book is about before you pick it up: the universe is big and if there are aliens, we should know where they are by now, or at least that they exist.The book begins with an enjoyable mini-biography on Enrico Fermi, an explanation of the concept of a paradox, and then a detailed description of the Fermi Paradox itself. From there, we do in fact get 75 possible explanations of why we haven’t found aliens yet.Mr. Webb breaks these 75 explanations into four categories.•	They Are (Were) Here (10)•	They Exist, But We Have Yet to See or Hear From Them (40)•	They Don’t Exist (24)•	The Right Solution (1)In each category, we’re introduced to explanations one at a time with an apparently thoughtful treatment of exactly what the explanation is and entails, and then a sometimes thoughtful and sometimes dismissive period of knocking it down. There are the UFO enthusiast theories, a large number of variations on “space is big” and all the different ways aliens could be colonizing the universe, all the things that could go wrong for a society confined to one planet, all the reasons why we could actually be alone, and the right answer.Some of the solutions are entertaining, some are laughable (and no always in a good way), and some are actually treated with scientific rigor. Of course, some are also treated with disdain.And then there’s the author’s solution, which is basically that we don’t know enough yet to be able to decide if it’s something we can know or find out yet.Overall rating: 3 stars. I’m not sure what I expected when I picked up the book, but what I got was a sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes eye rolling critic of 74 thoughts on where all the aliens are. The author stood every “solution” up only to knock it down, but I think I would have liked more science and fewer conspiracy theories. Actually, I probably would have given it an extra star."
236,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69748822-alex,4,Stephen Webb presents a thorough exploration of the Fermi Paradox. Using research he describes a number of potential solutions as well as their flaws. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed A Brief History of Time.
237,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10672905-sonia-wilson,5,"Very neat book for anyone interested in astronomy, physics, or paradoxes! Almost makes me wish I hadn't skipped that physics class back in high school. Having weaseled my way out of any extra classes involving numbers, however, I can report that this book manages to be informative and lightly technical in spots without going over the head of this math-illiterate Classics major. I was originally put on to this book by Canadian futurist, ethicist, and animal rights advocate George Dvorsky, who listed it among his favorites. Since his work is always crazy interesting, I figured I couldn't go too far wrong following his recommendations. By collecting an illustrative range of solutions to the Fermi Paradox in one volume, this book makes a valuable contribution to popular science, where the interest-rich, but theory-impoverished like myself gather crumbs.A couple of articles I've read recently pertain to the subject: This 2012 Newsweek article on the concept of the multiverse dovetails with Solution #8, particularly the third idea of black holes and the creation of universes on pages 57-59: http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek.... This NPR article from 2013 about the emerging uniqueness of our own solar system fits into section number 3 of the book, in particular Solutions #37 and #35: http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/201...."
238,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,3,"I'd heard about this book for a while and, while I'm glad to have read it and I did find it interesting, it left me a bit underwhelmed. My primary issue is with the author's lack of imagination and rather irritating tendency to dismiss ideas without explaining why he's doing so. Several of the entries are wrapped up with, essentially, ""This is a very compelling resolution to Fermi's Paradox, but I'm not convinced""; if you set out to explain why proposed solutions to a conundrum do or don't work, then you need to demonstrate why said solutions do or don't hold-simply saying you do/don't buy it isn't good enough. Barring that rather annoying tendency, Webb does a marvelous job of covering the topic (albeit not exhaustively), delving into detail where needed and giving most of the proffered solutions the treatment they're due. His own conclusion is reasoned well, though I'm not sure I agree with it, primarily because Webb makes quite a few assumptions about the base-line criteria for intelligent life that, while reasonable and certainly applicable where we're concerned, may not be absolutely applicable to intelligent life everywhere. Still, great book on the subject and an excellent source of brain candy to chew on."
239,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201264-anthony,4,"I think the author does a great job laying out many different types of arguments which attempt to answer the Fermi Paradox, knowing fully well that most of those arguments aren’t even refutable using the scientific methods, given our existing technology and data. The strength of this book doesn’t lie in the way the author clinically tries to agree or disagree with each hypothesis (a better word might be “speculation”, since the hypothesis is not testable), but the way in which he introduces and explains each one of them. I especially liked his elaboration on how the appearance and the subsequent development of life might be an extremely low probability event, more so than people appreciate; perhaps low enough to offset the reducio ad absurdum argument - “but sir, that is absurd, there are billions upon billions of stars out there”. Personally, I am very interested in the SETI program, and my thought is that the Fermi Paradox would gain more attention and debate as the” great silence” continues. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to get ready in the event that discussion heat up and brush up on the multiple approaches to the paradox. "
240,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"Yeah, I made it! That was a very interesting, hard and thought provoking read. The first three chapters were easy to read but once you get into the scientific bits you have to really focus to get anything out of it, I could barely do more than one solution per sitting. There’s no story, it’s just a pure collection of hard science facts applied to find a solution to the question of life out there in the universe.It’s super fascinating, and I loved it! The parts about possible Type II or III Civilisations with self replicating probes and communication technologies and languages far beyond our understanding were my favourites. Also it was amazing to read about natural science history and exactly how lucky a species we are to be where we are. I mean, it’s incredible how we’ve come here, how the moon formed perfectly, how our planet and the atmosphere came about, how we don’t get frozen or burned to death and how we survive in this very dangerous galaxy.Even if it can be very frustrating that we’ve never heard from aliens, I’m staying optimistic. We probably won’t see or hear anything in our lifetimes, but we’ll get there."
241,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51034634-jeremy,5,"The book presents an exhaustive list of simple and more elaborate solutions to the Fermi paradox. Each of them is clearly stated and kept simple (without too much details). Additionally there are plenty of references to other books and scientific studies if one wants to learn more about a specific subject. I would have liked to read a few more ""solutions"" around the theme of the multiverse, parallel universes and recent work in theoretical physics (string theory for example) that could have enlarged even more the range of possible resolutions for the Fermi paradox. But maybe the reason of the omission is the lack of data and evidence about these two domains? Or perhaps the field is too complicated to be explained in simple terms and hence be presented in this book. Anyway it is definitely worth a read if you've ever caught yourself thinking: ""How can we be alone in the universe? Where is everybody?"""

Of my many college classics over way too many years, the Astro-GeoPhysics class I took from Prof. Kim Malville at CU Boulder is one that has had lasting impact. I wasn't a stellar (hehehe) student, but the readings have stuck with me, especially Carl Sagan's book on the probability of other life in the universe. I'm also grateful for Prof. Greg Rozenberg's patient review of DNA basics (so I could understand the concept of using DNA as massive parallel processing computers).

Several of the entries are wrapped up with, essentially, ""This is a very compelling resolution to Fermi's Paradox, but I'm not convinced""; if you set out to explain why proposed solutions to a conundrum do or don't work, then you need to demonstrate why said solutions do or don't hold-simply saying you do/don't buy it isn't good enough.

The first three chapters were easy to read but once you get into the scientific bits you have to really focus to get anything out of it, I could barely do more than one solution per sitting. There’s no story, it’s just a pure collection of hard science facts applied to find a solution to the question of life out there in the universe.It’s super fascinating, and I loved it! The parts about possible Type II or III Civilisations with self replicating probes and communication technologies and languages far beyond our understanding were my favourites. Also it was amazing to read about natural science history and exactly how lucky a species we are to be where we are. I mean, it’s incredible how we’ve come here, how the moon formed perfectly, how our planet and the atmosphere came about, how we don’t get frozen or burned to death and how we survive in this very dangerous galaxy.Even if it can be very frustrating that we’ve never heard from aliens, I’m staying optimistic.

Each of them is clearly stated and kept simple (without too much details). Additionally there are plenty of references to other books and scientific studies if one wants to learn more about a specific subject. I would have liked to read a few more ""solutions"" around the theme of the multiverse, parallel universes and recent work in theoretical physics (string theory for example) that could have enlarged even more the range of possible resolutions for the Fermi paradox. But maybe the reason of the omission is the lack of data and evidence about these two domains? Or perhaps the field is too complicated to be explained in simple terms and hence be presented in this book.

I wasn't a stellar (hehehe) student, but the readings have stuck with me, especially Carl Sagan's book on the probability of other life in the universe. I'm also grateful for Prof. Greg Rozenberg's patient review of DNA basics (so I could understand the concept of using DNA as massive parallel processing computers).

292,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3986902-john-szucs,4,"In the late 1940's, the great physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple but profound question. In essence, he observed that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, surely other intelligent, technological civilizations must have evolved. Some, if not most of them, would be older and more mature than our own and capable of either communicating with us, visiting us, or at least revealing some evidence of their existence. So, where are they?Scientists and other thinkers have pondered this question since Fermi posed it. In ""... Where Are They?,"" Stephen Webb surveys 50 possible solutions to the Fermi paradox. They range from the whimsical (""They Are Here and Call Themselves Hungarians"") to the profound (""They Stay Home... and Surf the Net"").Along the way, Webb draws on ideas from a wide variety of fields including physics, astronomy, geology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, and cognitive science. This sweep across the breadth of knowledge makes Webb's survey of the Fermi paradox so engaging. Even a well-read, scientifically literate reader will almost certainly learn something about our own world by following Webb through the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Personally, the life science are among my weaker subjects and I found Webb's explanation of topics such as amino acids, proteins, and enzymes and the replication of DNA to be clear, concise, and understandable.Webb also touches on deep concepts, such as the very definition of life and the fact that evolution is not a directed process that somehow strives to create more complex organisms, with intelligent creatures like ourselves at its pinnacle. Rather, evolution by means of natural selection simply drives the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Intelligence is one useful adaptation, but so is the simple hardiness of the extremophile species that make their homes next to deep-sea vents or even inside nuclear waste storage tanks. An intelligent, technological civilization like our own that is capable of radio communications and has taken at least early steps in spaceflight is far from an inevitable outcome of evolution.This last point is central to Webb's conclusion. He explains that the galaxy is not as hospitable to life as we might imagine and that to be habitable, a world must have the right geology and climate, be in the right orbit in the right kind of planetary system around the right kind of star, in the right part of the galaxy. Even this does not guarantee that life will evolve and, most crucially, there are many more steps, both biological and cultural, between a prokaryotic micro-organism and a communicating, space-faring civilization that the course of evolution may or may not take on a given world.Thus, as we continue to explore the Universe, we can expect to discover many more worlds beyond the hundreds of extrasolar planets we've already found in the past few years. Most will be barren. Of the remainder, many will be home only the simplest forms of life. A few will have more complex lifeforms, analogous to the plants and animals of our natural world. We will encounter only a few other intelligent species in the Galaxy, perhaps a few, or perhaps even none.This suggests that much of the Galaxy could be ours. Our descendants could live until the very end of the Universe, many billions of years from now. All we have to do is survive and mature, technologically and socially. If we do not, the rare spark of intelligence in the Galaxy might be extinguished. Webb's conclusion implies great opportunity and also great responsibility for our civilization."
293,0387955011,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the idea of extraterrestrial civilisations (ETCs) and wanting to know what the various sciences say about them. More specifically, it deals with a particular 'problem' the author calls Fermi's Paradox, which goes something like this: there are billions of stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy; and there are billions of galaxies in the universe — so the odds that there are very many highly developed extraterrestrial civilisations out there, all wanting to reach out to any other ETCs in the universe.Yet despite continued and continuing attempts for us earthlings to reach out and communicate with these civilisations, so far we have not been able to find any undeniable proofs that anyone or anything is trying to communicate with us, let alone finding any indisputable facts pointing to their existence, at least within our solar system. So far our efforts have been met with complete silence. So if the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody?Webb provides 50 'solutions' to this question: eight under the heading 'They are here' (my favourite of these is solution no 1: they are here and they call themselves Hungarians.); twenty-two under the heading 'They exist but have not yet communicated'; nineteen under the heading 'They do not exist'; and a final personal 'solution' of his own. What I found most enjoyable about this book is the way Webb deals with each suggested solution. First, a description of the solution; then an analysis (arguments for and against) all in a clear and friendly way which is eminently readable. Webb often comments personally on certain ideas in cheeky and cheery ways; so we feel safe and at home with him.Along the way the reader is introduced to a plethora of scientific ideas about the world, the cosmos, language, astrology, communications, biology, etc. Assumptions under certain approaches are highlighted and discussed. What do we mean by 'life'? for example; or: should we assume that utilising the electromagnetic spectrum is the most appropriate way for transmitting messages to the cosmos?; or: why should we assume that ETCs might even want to communicate to us? What language might they use? etc. etc. etc. The journey is rich and stimulating, almost too much so (I would suggest simply reading one 'solution and its analysis, then resting for a while before going on to the next 'solution').This book is perfect in exploring and explaining our scientific understanding of the world in these areas and does so without becoming bogged in jargon or highly complex analyses: it's almost as if one were meeting a friend over a cup of coffee, having intelligent, stimulating discussions on these fascinating subjects, leaving us with our minds brimming with ideas. Surely this is the way science can and should be taught for the ordinary person on the street. Highly recommended."
