0,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,3,"This is both an oddly well and oddly badly timed book as epitomised by this quote:As infectious diseases wane, attention is gradually shifting to other threats, many of which can also be contagious.Adam Kurchashki is one of the epidemologists leading the modelling effort for the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which advises the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies who in turn advise the UK government on Covid 19.If you're not following him on Twitter you should (@AdamJKucharski) and just today his team put out a sobering analysis of the necessity for lockdown measuresTo keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where “lockdown”-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability.https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid1...He's rightly resisted the tempation to do a quick rewrite/update of this book but it does then make for a read rather different to how it would have read 3 months ago:- mathematical topics like R0 reproduction number, SIR models and the threshold for herd immunity to kick in (1/(1-Ro)), which then might have been new information, are now part of every day conversation around the virtual office coffee machine; - but at the time the book was written, one gets the distinct impression that straight epidemology was seen as out of fashion, and so both to sell the book and to make his research useful the author attempts to extend epidemology to thing ""going viral"" in the wider world (social media posts, computer viruses). However these were rather weaker sections: the scientific read over feels rather a stretch, and the resulting text becomes rather anecdotal and scattergun. Nevertheless this is still a worthwhile read, particularly for the history of the epidemological tools that are now determining vital life and death decisions, for example the key role played by Ronald Ross, who studied and modelled malaria in the 19th century and:[Mathematician Klaus Dietz] would help bring the theory of epidemics out of its mathematical niche and into the wider world of public health. Dietz outlined a quantity that would become known as the ‘reproduction number’, or R for short. R represented the number of new infections we’d expect a typical infectious person to generate on average.And a comment relating to ""Spanish"" flu but equally pertinent today:Blaming certain groups for outbreaks is not a new phenomenon. In the sixteenth century, the English believed syphilis came from France, so referred to it as the ‘French pox’. The French, believing it to be from Naples, called it the ‘Neopolitan disease’. In Russia, it was the Polish disease, in Poland it was Turkish, and in Turkey it was Christian.A recent development he refers to in terms of more real-time modelling of epidemics has proven very valuable in tracing the spread of Covid-19 (see e.g. https://nextstrain.org/narratives/nco...)One of the best examples is the Nextstrain project, pioneered by computational biologists Trevor Bedford and Richard Neher. This online platform automatically collates genetic sequences to show how different viruses are related.And there are some wise words on the use of models - these two in particular:in essence, a model is just a simplification of the world, designed to help us understand what might happen in a given situation. Mechanistic models are particularly useful for questions that we can’t answer with experiments. If a health agency wants to know how effective their disease control strategy was, they can’t go back and rerun the same epidemic without it. Likewise, if we want to know what a future pandemic might look like, we can’t deliberately release a new virus and see how it spreads. Models give us the ability to examine outbreaks without interfering with reality. We can explore how things like transmission and recovery affect the spread of infection. We can introduce different control measures–from mosquito removal to vaccination–and see how effective they might be in different situations.andAccording to Chris Whitty, now the Chief Medical Officer for England, the best mathematical models are not necessarily the ones that try to make an accurate forecast about the future. What matters is having analysis that can reveal gaps in our understanding of a situation. ‘They are generally most useful when they identify impacts of policy decisions which are not predictable by commonsense,’ Whitty has suggested. ‘The key is usually not that they are “right”, but that they provide an unpredicted insight.While enjoying the book, I'd commend the author's twitter feed as a better and more timely read, hence the 3 stars."
1,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5384739-pamela,3,"I must admit to being a little disappointed in this book, but it is my own fault. I was expecting a discourse on the spread of diseases but instead found a book on the mathematics and vectors of why things spread (Yes, just like the title says.). Though the author works for the CDC he draws many of his examples and theories from economics. The writing is engaging and at times witty, still, I felt the author made his point early in the book and the rest was reiteration. "
2,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The Rules of Contagion is slightly out of my wheelhouse, being less about infectious disease and more about the principles underlying all kinds of contagion. Certainly, there are many examples taken from infectious disease, and it's a rather on-the-nose choice to read in the current climate (for posterity: I write this review in the midst of the UK's lockdown to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2)... but a good amount of it is discussing other ways of ""going viral"": computer viruses, internet memes, and even failure in the financial sector.I found it reasonably clear and easy to understand, and luckily the math content is pretty light and more theoretical than anything. I did feel sort of like it got stranded in the weeds, though: I wasn't sure where it was going, and as a consequence, I wasn't sure whether we got there or not. In the end, it sort of felt like I was being told a series of cool anecdotes and snippets from research, without them being entirely related to each other. There's no ur-theory of contagion here, just a ramble connecting some various strands of contagion theory together. That's not uninteresting, but it feels a little unsatisfying!"
3,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20483969-mario-hinksman,4,"A prophetically timed book from an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The author has a gift for writing, as well as maths and epidemiology. The first chapter seemed quite brilliant how he wove his early life experiences into the wider theme of humanity's battles with disease over millennia. Early pioneers like Ronald Ross who discovered that malaria was not caused by 'bad air' which gave the disease its name but by by mosquitoes. John Snow and his work on cholera in London is also explored with some fascinating details.Adam Kucharski explains the science in an accessible manner in terms of how contagion spreads including the increasingly well known concept of 'R' or 'reproduction number' which represents the number of people who, on average, one sufferer will infect. This in turn is a product of four other factors: Duration of infectiousness, Opportunities, Transmission Probability and Susceptibility of the population.The same concepts of contagion can in turn be applied to stock market bubbles, social media memes, folk tales, language and many other concepts.My one reservation was that I felt that the book devoted slightly too long to areas like computer viruses when I would have been interested to hear more about actual viruses. Yet this is a minor quibble about a well-written engaging exploration of a subject that became exceptionally relevant to 20202."
4,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13555808-john-anthony,3,"This book, published immediately prior to the Covid 19 pandemic in the UK, seemed an obvious read. I hadn’t however appreciated just how wide the author’s interpretation of ‘contagion’ would be. It would include the obvious spread of diseases to attack the human body, latterly including SARS, Ebola and the ‘flu outbreak of 2009. But it would also include viral infections of information systems and various other forms of crime.It was therefore much more than I had bargained for and I found myself skipping chunks of it. I really should have looked at it more closely before starting to read. It seems well researched and written but for me in this world of lock down, a bit of a slog."
5,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,0,"Here's the Inquisitive Biologist's take. It's certainly a timely book!https://inquisitivebiologist.com/2020...Excerpts:""Kucharski is uniquely positioned to write a wide-ranging book like this. Next to his current position, he is trained in mathematics and did a spot of interning with a bank when the 2008 financial collapse hit. As such, he is at ease explaining both epidemiology and investment banking. ...Particularly relevant to this moment in time are the epidemiological details, the titular rules of contagion. Kucharski introduces you to the SIR model, which describes how people move through three groups during a disease outbreak (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered), how this plays into the concept of herd immunity, and how vaccination influences this. He explains the reproduction number R, its four components, abbreviated DOTS (R = Duration × Opportunities × Transmission Probability × Susceptibility), and how this explains why measures such as washing your hands and social distancing have an effect. And then there are those mysterious superspreaders which requires Kucharski to delve into network topology (the architecture of connections in a network). Having read this book, you should come away with a far better understanding of these parameters and mechanisms.But here is the kicker of the book: these rules are not unique to disease outbreaks. Ideas from public health can and have been applied to numerous other fields. This sees Kucharski branch out widely and cover a huge number of seemingly unrelated topics. His internship with a bank has given him an insider’s view of financial contagion, allowing him to clarify pyramid schemes and financial bubbles, but also how the notion of superspreaders applied to the 2008 banking crisis.""Interesting . Look forward to reading it. I think. I'm pretty sick of reading about this stuff, to tell the truth...."
6,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was an excellent book. Author Adam Kucharski takes a deep dive into the topic of contagion; in financial bubbles, disease, and social behavior.""The Rules Of Contagion"" starts off with some basic epidemiology; The SIR Model, and S-curves.

It continues on, telling the reader about financial asset bubbles, pyramid schemes, and ""The Greater Fool Theory"".

The book also introduces the reader to the concept of the Basic Reproduction Number (or R Naught, or R0), herd immunity, and The 80/20 Rule. The author spends quite a bit of time talking about social cascades, going ""viral"", Bayesian reasoning and social media, in general. Some very good writing here. He also talks about crime-related contagion, including broken windows theory, mass shootings, and shootings in general.This was a great book. It was very well-researched, formatted and delivered. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in epidemiology, social psychology, or sociology in general. 5 stars."
7,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68692302-alicia-bayer,4,"When I requested an ARC of this book to review, I didn't realize how timely it would be when I read it. The author goes into great detail not just on how diseases spread (which I read with far more focus than I might have last year), but how that can be extrapolated to economics, viral trends, social media, banking crises, etc. I have to admit that I was far more interested in the biological aspects than the rest of it. It was certainly interesting to see how they all mirror each other as they spread, peak, etc. I do feel that I have a better understanding of how things spread in terms of diseases (though I already pretty much understood all of this) but also in these other areas. I liked the talk about specific diseases but of course this was written before he knew that those would be what many of us were most interested in, so there's lots of other material to read through between those tidbits. Those who are interested only in how diseases spread may be disappointed that this is not the primary focus of this book. It's still an interesting read, and does provide some good information on that, too.Thanks NetGalley for a digital ARC for the purpose of review."
8,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339227-jamie,5,"Excellent and very topical book. Lots of fascinating examples of contagion, including non-disease ones such as memes and obesity. Well written and structured with a good level of detail for the layperson. The narrator on audible was excellent as well."
9,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"This is a new book about contagion by a British professor with lots of knowledge about epidemics. The book was published in February 2020 so it is timely, except that to be printed in February, it could not possibly include anything on COVID-19. Bummer, but that is what sequels are for, I guess.Don’t worry about the time though. Kucharski quotes someone to the effect that “if you have seen one pandemic, you’ve seen ... one pandemic.” The details of particular plagues and viruses can differ widely such that direct comparisons are not typically fruitful.There is more, however. While pandemics may differ, the basic structures and dynamic processes involved in them have much in common with each other. There is a common set of approaches that scientists have taken towards studying pandemics and that is what this book is about. Kucharski is very effective in setting out how to look at viruses, plagues, and pandemics. In the process, he provides wonderful explanations of all the details that have likely be mystifying many of the people trying to make sense out of the new on COVID-19 - except for the politics, of course. Chapter 2 should be assigned reading to anyone interested in COVID-19.The rest of the book actually moves beyond pandemics to look at how the theory of contagions has been applied to other areas, including innovation, marketing, finance, social media and a range of social psychological areas. You will even learn about the dissemination of “fake news”. This part of the book is also quite good, although it is not the set of topics that drew me to this originally.The book is well written, well cited, and very effective in presenting limited data and graphics to make critical points. It is well worth reading."
10,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3967110-tom-roth,4,"Very relevant & clear book! I like the links between economy, internet and epidemiology. It really helps to understand how different factors can increase/decrease the spread of an idea/disease/financial crisis. I have to admit that I expected a bit more about disease, and less about application of epidemiological theory in other fields. But in the end, I actually like the approach. As the book title already suggests, it has definitely improved my understanding of how things can spread, and how many similarities there are between the different fields."
11,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6409826-john-kaye,3,"Obviously a timely read! The first half of the book is much better than the second half—the cynic in me would say that he wasn't able to stretch the real biological explanations for disease transmission etc. without getting more technical than the publisher would allow, so the second half rather pivots to the non-biological and a recitation of recent viralish events in the online world., with occasional references to links to epidemiological evidence.Amused that in the last chapter, which discusses briefly the coming pandemic, he expects a new vaccine to be ready in six months (not specifuically about Covid-19, though)."
12,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24054231-karthik-shashidhar,3,"Yet another popular science book that could have easily been 50% shorter without losing any information value. First few chapters are good, and then the book descends into rants. "
13,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7885778-nadine,4,"This went off on a slow start and by 1/2 way through I couldn’t put it down. Extremely prescient as it was written & published before COVID-19 and manages to talk about the spread of all things from disease to tweets, videos, computer viruses to disinformation. I found myself often reaching for my laptop to research something further.My only gripe would be that there were too few images - the ones in the book were interesting but it would have been good to have more. And look up nextstrain.org - fascinating real-time tracking of pathogen evolution. "
14,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,5,"One of the most followed and admired epidemiological handles on Twitter is the one belonging to Adam Kucharski. A Mathematician, and Epidemiologist at The London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, Mr. Kucharski keeps his ‘followers’ informed, invested and entertained thereby allowing them to find their way through times unprecedented. One of his threads on the fundamentals of how a virus works has been the one of the most accessed on social media. Now Mr. Kucharski brings the same insights and information to bear in his authoritative new work, “Contagion.” A delight for the expert and the uninitiated alike, “Contagion” demonstrates with a pleasantly surprising verve, a myriad of linkages connecting the study of epidemics with other seemingly unrelated spheres such as gun violence, financial crisis etc.As Mr. Kucharski points out, following the woeful financial crisis that rocked the world in 2008, central banks across the world, latching onto the repository of knowledge built upon the study of infectious diseases, homed in on the concept of networks. A structure of a network could amplify contagion. This was a theory pioneered by researchers engaged in the study of Sexually Transmitted Infections as far back as in the 1980s and 1990s. Similarly, notions such as the basic rate of reproduction or reproduction numbers are enabling researchers quantify the spread of innovations and online content.Mr. Kucharski begins the book with a poignant personal reference. Struck down by Guillain-Barre Syndrome when still a toddler, the author completes a long and arduous path to recovery aided and abetted by a pair of resilient and resolute parents who keep reminding their son that GBS stands for ‘getting better slowly.’ Mr. Kucharski, in an eerie coincidence comes face to face with his old adversary after many years, when, in 2015, during a course of investigating a dengue fever epidemic in the Fijian Capital of Suva, he finds many patients afflicted by GBS. This endeavour results in the evaluation of surprising linkages between GBS syndrome and various other neurological ailments. As the COVID-19 epidemic of today is leaving the medical and the political community stumped with its mischief, so did the Zika virus with its shenanigans when it first struck. Mr. Kucharski requotes epidemiologist Laura Rodriguez in 2016, “rarely have scientists engaged with a new research agenda with such a sense of urgency, and from such a small knowledge base.” Since then as Mr. Kucharski illustrates, we have come a long way using welcome aids such as Information Technology and community outbreak research. “One of the best examples is the Nextstrain project, pioneered by computational biologists, Trevor Bedford and Richard Neher. This online platform automatically collates genetic sequences to show how different viruses are related and where they might have come from…Nextstrain has proved to be a powerful idea, not just because it brings together and viualises all the available sequences but because it’s separate from the slow and competitive process of publishing scientific papers.”Mr. Kucharski keeps his narration riveting and shies away from employing technical jargon that might put the lay reader into a bind, if not a tizzy. Taking his readers through various epidemiological techniques employed by pioneers such as Sir Ronald Ross whose forays into the study of malaria are legendary, to the studies of William Kermack (who in 1924 was permanently blinded while working on a corrosive alkali solution in the Edinburgh’s Royal College of Physicians Laboratory) and Anderson McKendrick, Mr. Kucharski highlights the marvelous trajectory that epidemiological research has taken as time has evolved. Kermack and McKendrick evolved the Susceptible Infectious Recovered (“SIR”) Model, which postulates that for an outbreak to gain traction, three important factors are necessary: “a sufficiently infectious pathogen, plenty of interactions between different people, and enough of the population who are susceptible.”Mr. Kucharski finds himself possessing two unusual and seemingly unconnected domains of expertise. Starting out his early career as an aspiring investment banker, he plied his trade with one of the financial institutions in Canary Wharf before the lure of epidemiology took over him. Hence he brings to bear this an invaluable two-pronged knowledge identifying unique connections between medical outbreaks and spreads of a non-medical nature, such as ideas. Referring to the 1962 work of Everett Rogers, “Diffusion of Innovations”, Mr. Kucharski informs us that four types of people are responsible for a product to become popular: “initial uptake comes from ‘innovators’, followed by ‘early adopters’, then the majority of the population and finally ‘laggards.”As Mr. Kucharski holds forth, the economist Jean-Paul Rodrigue proposes dividing a financial bubble into four main stages. These stages bear an uncanny resemblance to an epidemic outbreak too. It all begins with the stealth phase, where specialist investors invest in a new idea. This is closely followed on its heels by the awareness phase, with a wider gamut of investor involvement. As and when the idea gains popularity and spreads fast, the media and the public drop their hats into the fray, driving the prices in only one direction – north. Finally, the bubble bursts, during the ‘blow off’ phase. Now compare this with the four phases of an outbreak: spark; growth; peak, and decline.As the entire world is left to grapple with the consequences of COVID-19, one of the most, if not the most important facet associated with the management of the pandemic is reigning in its “reproduction number’ or ‘R Nought/Naught’. What exactly is this notion? Mr. Kucharski educates his readers on the work of Mathematician Klaus Dietz which resulted in the use and implementation of the R Nought. “R represented the number of new infections we’d expect a typical infectious person to generate on average…If R is below one, each infectious person will on average generate less than one additional infection….If R is above one, the level of infection will rise on average, creating the potential for a large epidemic.”Drawing on the concept of R, Mr. Kucharski comes up with the acronym, ‘DOTS.’ DOTS stands for: duration of time a person is infectious; the average number of opportunities they have to spread the infection each day they are infectious; the probability an opportunity results in transmission; and the average susceptibility of the population.”Mr. Kucharski relies on the work of the epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta in 1989 to correlate the dynamics of infection with a financial contagion. The spread of infections is dependent upon whether networks related to it are ‘assortative’ or ‘disassortative’ in nature. In the former, highly connected individuals are linked mostly to highly connected people. “This results in an outbreak that spreads quickly through these clusters of high-risk individuals, but struggles to reach the other, less connected parts of the network. However, in a disassortative network, high risk people are connected to low-risk ones, making the spread of the infection slower initially, but resulting in a larger overall epidemic. The banking network, according to Mr. Kucharski, turned out to be disassortative. This led to failed institutions such as Lehman Brothers spreading the contagion far and wide. Social contagion is also an interesting concept that has captured the imagination of the public at large. Physicians Nicholas Christakis and social scientist James Fowler’s famous, albeit controversial study on “The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years”, gets a special mention in Mr. Kucharski’s book.“Contagion” abounds with interesting references such as the ones mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. Peculiar and asymmetrical patterns are dissected and social relationships analysed. In an interesting reference to “transmission of suicides”, Mr. Kucharski refers to a 1974 paper published by David Phillips examining media coverage of suicides. “He found that when British and American newspapers ran a front-page story about a suicide, the number of such deaths in the local area tended to increase immediately afterwards.” In fact, researchers in Columbia University found a 10 percent increase in suicides following the death of Hollywood actor Robin Williams.The correlation between online platforms and biological occurrences can also be uncanny. Most of these platforms that are algorithm driven, feed on a self-perpetuating diet of undesirable viewing choices, pulling people further and further down what technology researcher Zeynep Tufekci terms an online rabbit hole. These algorithms draw people towards content that are more incendiary in general according to Ms. Tufekci. As Mr. Kucharski expounds, “the same situation arises in the biological world. Many species have to adapt simply to keep pace with their competitors. After humans came up with antibiotics to treat bacterial infections, some bacteria evolved to become resistant to common drugs. In response we turned to even stronger antibiotics. This put pressure on bacteria to evolve further. Treatments gradually became more extreme, just to have the same impact as lesser drugs did decades earlier. In biology this arms race is known as the ‘Red Queen effect’, after the character in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass….”At the time of this writing, there seems to be a glimmer of hope in so far as the efforts to combat COVID-19 go. In a drug trial titled “Recovery” – an acronym for Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy that was set up in nine days, and had recruited 11,500 Covid patients in 175 hospitals across the UK, it was revealed that Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which has been in use since the early 1960s has the potential to cut the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third, and for those on oxygen by a fifth. This has been the most welcome news in an otherwise depressing miasma of death and excruciatingly prolonged recoveries laced with lasting side effects. This refreshing piece of news bears monumental testimony to the indefatigable work of people such as Adam Kucharski and his ilk. A band of selfless virus hunters who have taken it upon themselves to make the world a happier, healthier and harmonious place to inhabit. And to their efforts, we remain eternally indebted.(Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why by Adam Kucharsky is published by Basic Books, an imprint of Perseus Books, a subsidiary of Hachette Book Group Inc and will be released on the 7th of July 2020.)"
15,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60249467-rakshit-ranjan,2,"The title, the deceptively attractive cover page and the release date (13 Feb 2020) led me to pick this book up. Although the description mentions that the book covers contagions beyond the realms of epidemiology, the organisation of the same in the book is highly disappointing. It is unclear what the author wants to convey.The chapters are randomly divided with the content having no bearing to the title/context that the chapter wants to establish. I struggled through the majority of the book trying to create a mental model of takeaways that I'll have.The book contains some novel ideas, is backed by solid research and is simple to read (not inundated with scientific jargon/mathematical theories). But the organisation and structuring of the material could have been a lot better. It seems like the publishers brought it to the market before polishing the final draft to ride on the COVID-19 outbreak momentum."

17,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62790508-dewi-erwan-humphreys,3,"I'd give it a 3.5/5. Many interesting anecdotes, and some very insightful points, but on the whole it seemed quite haphazard. The most interesting point for me was the contrast between the act of ""going viral"" biologically vs online, where going viral biologically usually means a slow and steady transmission from person to person, while going viral online usually requires ""broadcast events"" where one person with a large following brings a lot of attention to a certain idea/post."
18,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10011319-chase,0,"Kucharski's The Rules of Contagion is perhaps nicely and equally poorly timed in its release, amidst the COVID-§9 global pandemic. The text offers insight into contemporary sources of contagion, first, using simple and accessible language to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of epidemiological approaches to disease pandemics, including ebola, HIV, and influenza. In the latter half of the book, Kucharski attempts to tie disease pathology into economic, behavioural, psychological and technological analyses, extrapolating epidemiological knowledge into formative societal structures and historical events (e.g. the 2008 financial crisis). Most notable about this latter half is the author's delineation of social media contagion, carefully balancing both the benefits and dangers of online contagion - ""going viral"" on social media vs. computer viruses. Largely, the book broaches a huge range of epistemological assertions, placing it firmly in the domain of popular science. The book lost steam around chapter three, despite an attempt to create a wide-ranging theory of contagion: as some other reviews have aptly noted, the latter section feels more like a confirmation and reiteration of contagion - its own sort of doctoral ""case studies"" following the juicy theory. Hence readers invested in the evolving COVID-19 pandemic will be especially drawn to chapters 1-2, and enthusiasts of pandemics, medical historians, epidemiologists and other pop-science readers might find the book as a whole interesting as a ruminative, though small, addition to academic scholarship on global networks, virality, social media and the Internet."
19,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26845418-krakra,5,"An indispensable guide to the field of contagion that encompasses epidemics, stock exchanges crashes, viral tweets, spread of computer viruses, and even 'mutations' in the context of cultural heritage, like evolution of myths and stories. The book is very well written and provides a wealth of information. Various little stories are highly informative and illuminating. The book becomes at a certain moment a bit tedious because of many small bits of informations that do not translate into a smooth narrative. It is more informative and valuable than books of, say, Malcolm Gladwell at the cost of being less engagingly written. Perhaps it is unavoidable if one wants to be closer to science than journalism. The book is also (by sheer accident) extremely timely. If you want to learn about 'herd immunity', 'infection curve', etc. you don't need to look further. "
20,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40121219-omkar-shukla,4,"If you've seen one epidemic, you've seen........ one epidemic.It's not a good time to read books on how Infectious diseases spread. But I have followed the mathematical modelling for Infectious diseases and the predictions made by them for the COVID-19 outbreak closely.I can honestly say that I'm surprised by the mathematical base that this book has built in me. The mathematics of the disease modelling isn't a perfect one specially early in the outbreak. The researchers have so many variables to account for in the models.In addition to the Infectious diseases, this book also talks about information epidemics, computer virus epidemics and their growth fuelled by the interconnected network of computers and Internet of Things. That was an interesting read. One of the positive things that I learned from this book is that we get better at understanding outbreaks as we understand more about the underlying disease. Let's hope that's the case with COVID-19."
21,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41152953-elena-granger,3,"The book is informative and gives a great perspective on how all the viral things spread. Actually I've never thought that there is something in common between spreading diseases, social and antisocial behaviour, even economical events. Great ideas give you perspectives to think different and to look at different events under different angles.But there is the same issue to this book as in other books of the genre. Too many repetitions of the same idea, again partly a waste of time if you don't skim some parts."
22,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364022-gabe,3,"An interesting book. The first half, concentrated on biological examples, was nice but sometime the subject was not thoroughly analysed, only skimmed. And it jumped from subject to subject. The second half has this interesting concept of contagion spreading also in the internet, news, children stories etc, and had some funny curiosities but sometimes the supposed contagion mechanism was bent a bit. Even the author said it was more because of one large burst than a network."

24,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54912691-bianca,4,"I find it a bit ironic that this book released shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic! Written by a mathematician and associate professor at London School of Hygiene, the book explores not only how viruses spread, but also how ideas do (viral videos, gun violence, computer viruses, to name a few). Mathematics and the use of scientific models are at the core of understanding, predicting and controlling contagions. From these concepts onward, various cases are explored in more detail which made the book very fascinating. "

It also veered off the main focus of the book, particularly into the area of data and privacy. This was interesting enough, but seemed unrelated to the main focus of the book, to the point that the book was losing focus."

I found it a readable ""text"" book and interesting when it moved away from viral epidemics and looked at the way things spread in banking and the internet. As it was written before the present high profile/panic it makes for a sensible calm assessment of epidemic research."
31,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4603788-gary-lang,5,"The Rules of Contagion"" is available in the UK, not the United States. Although it is easy to get from Amazon in the UK. I read about it in the Economist in their April 4th edition; It sounded too timely to wait until September to read it, so I bought the p-book from Amazon.co.uk. Looking on Amazon.com, I see the updated publishing date in the U.S. was July 7 and you can now get it. It looks as if it’s been updated for Covid-19, but largely in the context of the existing material, which really tells you what you need to know to think about the mathematics of its threat, how herd immunity works, and so on. That’s good and was a source of comfort I got out of reading this in April – we’ve been here before, and just need to apply what we have learned in the last 100 years carefully to bring the spread down while we develop the right preventative measures and treatments. The Economist review of the book is summarized as: ""Today, the freedoms and daily routines of many countries are held in the hands of epidemiologists. Amid the pandemic, these mathematical modelers have supplied scenarios for how travel bans, social distancing or stay-at-home policies could alter the trajectory of covid-19. This book charts the history of this now-pivotal science, from its origins in understanding the spread of malaria at the turn of the 20th century, to its central role in predicting the dissemination of everything from diseases to fake news in the 21st."". Adam Kucharski is an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Given this, I was hoping to read about the common mathematical underpinnings of what Ronald Ross author of the 1910 book “The Prevention of Malaria” termed a “theory of happenings”. Ross intuited that the characteristics of the malaria spread he analyzed could also be applicable to other things that happen over time. He said, “in my own opinion my principle work has been to establish the general laws of pandemics”. As Kucharski then says, “he didn't just mean disease epidemics”. So, the book contains great examples of non-disease epidemics and the similarities between them in terms of how susceptible, susceptibility, infection, and recovery occur in “happenings” such as: 1) disease contagions 2) the spread of ideas (sometimes referred to as memetics) 3) the diffusion and adoption of technology 4) “viral” marketing campaigns I found the material on pandemics to be good, though lightweight background for the deeper reading I have been doing since February of academic research papers about COVID-19. But I learned more from these research papers then the book about this topic. In addition, I had already read better books about the spread of ideas: 1) “Thought Contagion” by Aaron Lynch 2) “The New Science of the Meme” by Richard Brodie (MSFT employee #77, by the way) 3) “The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins 4) “Linked” by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi The book gives a great overview of epidemic theory. You have probably heard about the reproduction number otherwise known as R0 – pronounced “R-naught”. Kucharski says: “(R0) asks: How many people would we expect the case to pass the infection on to?” He compares R0 for pandemic flu, Ebola, HIV, smallpox, and measles. We also learned that R0 depends on four factors: The duration of time a person is infectious. The number of opportunities – on average, that an infections person has daily while they are infectious. Transmission probability of b). The average susceptibility of a population. and how each of these four variables can be traded off against each other to produce R0. Here is the equation: R0 = Duration x Opportunities x Transmission probability x Susceptibility. He uses the mnemonic “DOTS” to refer to these four factors and makes it clear that all conversations about how to deal with viruses must refer to each of these elements to be intellectually valid. We also see these variables defined for and applied to the viral spread of Internet posts and gun violence. Seeing the parallel applicability of these concepts towards the major events we are experiencing now will give you a good framework for thinking about and evaluating proposed solutions to many of our culture’s current challenges. As I said, I was hoping to learn more about the mathematics of these applications than Kucharski presents here. Nevertheless, “The Rules of Contagion” is still a good book for people who want an introduction to concepts underlying contagions. It is obviously a great thing to get some grounding in today. Most readers will find that the intellectual coverage gained from reading this book around these topics more reassuring than frightening. You will better understand what needs to be done during the current pandemic and be personally equipped to judge our leaders are handling COVID-19 for yourself. 5 Stars - I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Also on Medium."

The book very pragmatically explains to the model of how a piece of news spreads across dangerously than the disease whether it's an epidemic or pandemic.What I like:1. The profound explanation of what contagion is and its aftermath effects alongside the causes are explained in detail2. On how a conspiracy or disbelief gets spread across the world which involves a virus or the flu or some health ailment is explained well.3. Many practical examples are coherently explained that also create awareness amongst the readers.4. The journey of Sir. Ronald Ross and a few others are found very interesting. I say this very strongly because I live near the Fever Hospital that was started on Ross's name at Hyderabad. It feels close to know him.5. The most important thing in the book that is to be observed is how fake news is spread and how it affects every walk of life is very well explained.6. Every chapter and example can be related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and thus the book behaves an eye-opener. 7. The responsibility as a citizen of any nation in order not to spread or believe fake news and hold the sanctity of humanity intact is the underlying lesson of the book.What I didn't like:At some places, I felt too much explanation is used which looked more like a textbook rather than a general book.Narration:Though a non-fiction book, the narration stands out because of the thorough explanation and description of various incidents, people, health concerns in the past around the world, illustrations in pictures and etc., The narration definitely hooks the readers to the book.Language & Grammar:Quality language with rich and technical vocabulary is found in the book.My Final Verdict:Right book at the right time!Book Title: 4/5Book Cover: 4/5Inside the book: 4/5Narration: 4/5Language & Grammar: 4/5Final Rating: 4/5"
33,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117615994-datoclement,3,"TL;DR: Pros: Rich of history and stories. Intuitive introduction of theory for beginners. Cons: Expected more theories. Mundane mentions of problems of ethics and data for research. Sporadic anecdotes feeling off-topics.Summary and Main Ideas:The author leads us through a variety of examples from the real-world applications of ""the theory of 'happening's"", a term coined by the pioneer of epidemiology at his time and the Nobel Prize laureate Ross. As is how I understand it, ""happening"" means here an abstraction of a process for a networked set of entities (people, Twitter accounts, routers...) where certain properties/states (being infected by virus, obesity, retweeting) become more and more prevalent among these entities through the network.One of the recurrent concepts in the book is the replication number R, which characterises the rate of growth of infected population. Its importance lies on that it is relatively easy to measure in practice and provides guidance to how to control the system. Another undergoing theme is the classification of ""happening""s. Why does sometimes the disease explode and then suddenly disappear while in other cases it stays for long time? Why can some have long thin transmission path while others can't? Two keys to look at are 1) the topology of the network and 2) the characteristics of transmission (simple or complex contagion). Happenings behave differently in a network where entities are evenly connected and in a network where there are some rather ""popular"" entities. Bearing different assumptions, these idealisations of ""happening"" help us to see different nature of different happenings in real life.How to solve a practical problem in the framework of this theory of happenings is another major composition of the book. Ex. What difference did this theory make in policy making to gun violence? This is more of interest of history where the study of epidemiology found its usage in other studies and the insight from it transformed the way people think in domains of finance, social network, criminology and so on.At the latter part of the book, it focuses more on the difficulty of the research and the application, ranging from ethics, data acquisition to data interpretation, which is quite a common theme among increasingly data-intensive research.My Opinion:A book rich of fascinating history and intriguing examples. Intuitive explanation of theory behind to beginners.As a reader of enough theoretical background, I expected more in-depth paragraphs of its theory than what actually is presented. Also, I was a bit fed-up by the part telling that the research is difficult because of ethics and data, not because I disagree but because the topic is too usually come up with and nothing new I feel that I can really learn from it.The cybersecurity part is not relevant I feel. Besides that there is ""virus"" and it scales rapidly like an epidemic, I don't see relation between them. The story that registering an unregistered long gibberish domain name stopped a cyberattack is an interesting anecdote but feels off-topic."
34,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20793632-tania-hubmayer,3,"This book was published on February 13th 2020 at a time when anyone paying attention was horrified at the images of a modern day plague overwhelming the Chinese hospital system to the extent that new temporary hospitals had to be built, all parts of the country locked down and medical workers rushed to Hubei Province to help deal with the epidemic. This book was already out of date on its publication and I would be very interested to see a revised version with extra chapters on CoViD19. The medical aspects of this book were in fact quite riveting. The author is an expert on infectious diseases and last year I would have been very impressed with the way he is able to relate epidemiology to so many other areas. However one month after this book was published I found it annoying since this author had so many interesting comments to make about medicine. There was Florence Nightingale and how her team of nurses (along with structural engineers to fix sanitation) were able to remarkably lower the death rate and revolutionise attitudes towards hospitals and infectious diseases by using statistical graphs. There were the scientists and doctors who worked to understand cholera, malaria, HIV/AIDS, Zika and Ebola.Then he just happened to mention a study in chapter 3 about meaningful social contacts and which can change how infectious influenza can be in different countries. Italy was given as an example of a country where people had ten contacts per day, while the UK and Hong Kong only had five contacts in a day. As of April 2nd Italy has had more deaths than any other nation from CoViD19. Then he went on to discuss the relationship between schools and influenza outbreaks. School holidays were notably times of lower infection rates. He also mentioned the much longer length of time families are affected by influenza and colds in winter when they have children attending school.After reading chapter 3, closing of all schools and limiting social contacts appears a no-brainer, and yet most countries have only done this when absolutely forced to in this current CoViD19 pandemic.This was a good book, but it urgently needs to be revised..."
35,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22910172-sorrento,5,"Adam Kucharski’s new book is a timely publication dealing with the fascinating science of epidemiology and not just of infectious diseases. The sub title of the book is “why things spread the way they do and why they stop”. Kucharski trained as a mathematician and for a time worked as an intern at a city bank before turning his hand to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where he now works. Quite a few pages of “The Rules of Contagion” are devoted to situations where ideas can spread in an analogous way to an infection and in some cases are actually referred to as a virus. So, there are sections on pernicious ideas that spread throughout the banking system and posts on the internet spread by millions of people who share them and also malicious viruses spread on computers by people intent on disrupting our globally interconnected lives. Technical terms such as reproduction numbers and how they are used in epidemics and immunisation programmes are eloquently explained in this timely book. Adam Kucharski sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling Group (SIP-M) one of the three subgroups to SAGE the UK government’s advisory panel currently shaping policy on tackling the coronavirus. Ministers and the rest of the public would be well advised to read this brilliant book."
36,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99719985-lena-verenes,0,"I borrowed the book as ebook from my library, apparently shortly after it first became available. It looked like the most interesting book in a list of pandemic / virus related non-fiction.It took me a few days to start it and by then there were 3 people on the waiting list for it, which is shown in red font in my library ebook reading app. This visual reminder made me want to finish the book quickly, but I find non-fiction takes more work.I recognised a bit of the vocabulary from the podcast I recently started listening to, also virus related. It made it easier for me to follow some of the content. But it was generally written clearly and for people who don't usually read about R-numbers. I liked that the book covers many very different worlds - financial, health, marketing and shows parallels in developments there. In this case I was more interested in the health aspect than the other areas. But the additional topics made good examples and were illustrative.As usual, I enjoy books that make me feel like I understand (some of) the topic discussed, even if this understanding doesn't last. But they take a lot of concentration, which I find difficult to muster, at the moment. "
37,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77278659-neil-hunt,5,"Mathematicians view of contagion. Kucharski starts with infectious diseases, explains the mathematics of modeling exponential growth, and talks about how to limit and contraction spread. He talks about identifying pathways of transmission, and how it is necessary to limit any of the four “dots”: duration of infection, opportunity to spread it, transmission modes, and susceptibility of the other parties to curtail an infectious outbreak.He expands in infectious ideas, advertising, and social media, as well as crime, violence, hacking. Many of the ideas from infectious disease apply equally in these cases too, even if the goal is sometimes to maximize spread of an idea or an ad.We learn about concepts like super spreaders, and how the infections can spread fat and wide even if the median infectious person spreads it to <<1 additional person, is a small fraction can spread it to many. Interestingly, broadcast or superspread gets wide but short duration events, while ideas with more uniform infectious can last for a long time; the same with diseases.There is little or no biology in this book.This book was written before COVID-19, but the examples from SARS, Ebola, and Zika are quite relevant."
38,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12495146-john-b,4,"4.0 Stars. A timely, well-written book. The author is a mathematician and I enjoy his writing style. This book would fall under the label of popular mathematics—meaning that he is writing to an audience not conversant in higher mathematics. He begins by discussing how the mathematical model for contagious and infectious disease was developed and then he spends the rest of the book discussing all different types of real world examples that benefit from the application of the mathematical model: advertising, facebook—social media, computer viruses and worms, political ideas, networks, new ideas. It has been a very timely and interesting read for this moment of history.The style is reminiscent of a Malcolm Gladwell book--though with a decidedly scientific bent. I am amazed at how well structured the book was. The topics were joined nicely and the story and detail were woven into a fantastic narrative structure. Is this an indication of the quality of the editing? It is rare to see an author who has invested much time and effort into researching a topic to spare us all the detail and just provide the pieces that are needed to compel the reader to stay engaged in the text."
39,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88559-ann,3,"As we are in midst of the Covid-19 epidemic, this book would seem to offer a lot to think about. Kucharski connects the spread of disease to the spread of other things, such as ideas, behaviors, and even events, such as those of the 2008 financial crisis. All of that sounds like an interesting formula, but the book falls short, mostly because Kucharski doesn’t describe any rules for contagion, as the title promises. Instead, the book seems to meander from one summarized research study to the next, interwoven with some historical figures and social events. It lacks organization, and other than learning about the R (reproduction) number used to characterize the spread of contagion, I couldn’t really tell you any other rule. In fact, I didn’t see much connection at all between, for example, the spread of disease and the spread of internet memes, other than the fact that they both do, indeed, spread. So while some of the events described in this book are inherently interesting, I wish there had been more organization to the information presented and perhaps a rethinking of the idea of “rules.” "
40,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38272008-richard,4,"A timely book that is eye-opening in showing how the mathematics of epidemiology have a much wider use than I might previously have suspected. Several of the topics covered, I am thinking especially of the contagion of gun violence, could easily have been the subject of books in themselves, which gives the feeling of rushing somewhat from subject to subject. The chapters on the financial markets and social media cover familiar territory and offer little in the way of fresh insight.Kucharski has an engaging writing style that blends anecdote with hard science, and the book is pitched well for the interested layperson. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the book is at its best on pandemic diseases. The book provides a fascinating account of how the link between mosquitoes and malaria was established and how the science of disease modelling developed. I also feel like I understand R! This is not a book about Covid, but it gives a grounding in some of the science behind the modelling.A fascinating book from an engaging writer, but a reader wouldn’t lose much by skipping the topics that don’t interest them."

42,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23224955-rajiv-chopra,3,"I thought this book to be a bit confusing. Adam Kucharski started well, by talking about how Dr Ross discovered how malaria spread, and how he further discovered that you do not need to eradicate every mosquito to control the spread. From there, he moved into a whole range of topics – the spread of social media; the dissemination of false information and them moved back to epidemiology. It was a bit difficult to follow his train of thought. While the topics themselves were interesting, he did not answer the questions of how contagion spreads, and how they are controlled. I did get a lot of seemingly useful information. However, he presented it in a manner that has made it difficult for me to digest it. I did not come away with an understanding of the factors that cause the spread of contagion. "

It is a treatise of many separate events and facts that can be read in many other books. So the book as such isn’t that novel.That this book is high on the list of recommended reads on Amazon in the times of the Corona virus pandemic, makes it all the more misleading... I really expected this book to be solely focussed on viruses.I think at most 10-15% of the book is about viruses.As a last point, I want to say that the writing style of the author is not that comfortable to read. This book could clearly use a review by an editor."

They fucking spread - kudos to Kucharski for coming up with a book that reveals so many hidden aspects of all types of contagions. The SIR model related to the epidemic was the high point of the book given the current prevailing pandemic. The book goes a long way in explaining concepts like herd immunity or reproduction number etc. It also answers obvious questions like how to stop it and how to trace it. No surprise that the book has come from an epidemiologist with mathematical background. A must read for those too who deal in administration of anything that goes contagious!"
45,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69314301-wej,4,"This is a highly readable popular science book on contagion. Being released in the middle of Covid-19 pandemic I expected it to be more focused on biological contagion. Instead, it turned out that the book is about all sorts of contagion: starting from the history of epidemiology (with a focus on the SIR model), then going through computer viruses, and spread of online (mis)information. The author explains how much more contagious biological viruses actually are when compared to spread of online information. The impact of influencers is negligible when compared to superspreaders of viruses as the biological infections tend to be passed further. Overall, it was a quick and pleasant read. Probably not the best popular science book to learn about viruses as the topic is not covered in depth. At times the research findings seemed slightly out-of-place but nonetheless were very cleary explained. 3.5/5"

There's interesting infographics and graphs showing how things spread through networks and why.While the book is a bit repetitive, especially toward the end, there is a lot of information and data. There are also interesting anecdotes from the author and others that have experienced similar spreads of information and experiences. It's an accessible read that's informative and fascinating. "

This book is a general look at networks and connectedness; including disease, behaviours, social media, computer viruses and ideas. The book had some very interesting anecdotes and, in particular, the genesis of epidemiology was fascinating.In all but the simplest cases it is impossible to disentangle the effect of an individual node from the properties of the network. The author didn't say this, but I think this is a good argument for society to move away from the capitalist narrative of individual success. It also reminded me of the Dan Dennett quote: ""The earth has grown a nervous system, and we are it"""

Published moments before the discovery of COVID-19, the book looks at the spread of disease, ideas and misinformation. More importantly, it breaks down the science and evidence behind this and how social, political and individual responses matter. It is well written, clearly argued and packed with anecdotes and references to bring the science to life."

However, a good 50% plus of the content is more on 'social' or 'ideas' contagion, so I was a bit disappointed by that. You'd be forgiven for coming across the title of this book amidst this crisis and thinking it was about contagion relating specifically to disease. With that said, I felt I had the struggle through the second half of the book, not really enjoying that much but trying to stick to my 'start a book, finish a book' goal. I'm interested in the epidemiological side of this, and I'd like to explore that more in other books. This book had some interesting points and served as a kind of useful intro but at the same time was quite disappointing given the misleading title. A lot of the content is also fairly repetitive. My advice is to pick something else if you are more interested in contagious disease specifically. "

Since the early 1900s, researchers have observed resemblances between how viruses spread and how ideas spread among people. Since then, similar patterns found in our financial systems and violence outbreaks. Sadly, the study of contagion lacks the data for analysis which causes slowdowns. There is hope that new technologies could bring more insight into human behaviour that benefit future outbreaks, but this data needs to be collected in ethical and transparent ways. "

It does feel like this is an introduction to the subject, and that more detail would have been required to make it authoritative. Nevertheless, thought-provoking and worth the time.

The chapters about the R or the reproduction number were the most interesting to me. The latter chapters headed into directions that I'd rather skip over. I would have preferred more information about pandemics."
55,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106010728-jens,0,"The analogy virus and ideas is set in a shorter timeframe in comparison to gene and meme. What might reveal here is not how things look similar in the world, but how we see things could be limited to the vision of finding familiars. I oppose this anthropocentric way of human transmission, why can't we expand to the communicative natural world and take this as an urgent manner to prepare for climate change and foreseeable ecological catastrophes?"
56,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10712377-david,3,"This is a well-written book and is particularly topical. The parts on how diseases and computer viruses/worms spread I found interesting. However, other parts of the book I found less absorbing, for example the chapters about how posts and memes spread on social media, and how companies try to get their ads noticed and acted upon. Overall I don't regret reading it but I was expecting a more exciting read."
57,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15510527-jessica-salazar,4,"Really interesting given the current situation - but I learnt an awful lot about other things that spread like memes, misinformation, computer viruses, people’s private data, and how the the massive amount we now know about these things can be used for good or “evil”. I’d imagine later editions will be furnished with a new chapter about COVID-19, as the book was so up to date its omission felt glaring, even though it was published on the brink of the pandemic emerging. "
58,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81390160-elisabeth-marksteiner,5,"This is NOT about COVID-19... it is about how things spread, whether that is disease, or ideas. I really enjoyed the historical context. And given that in the UK, we hear endlessly about the importance of R, it is fabulous to have more than the idea that it is just the number of people... Beautifully clearly written, this is for the layman who wants to understand “the science.” As such, I think that for those who aren’t mathematicians or scientists, this is a must read...Be informed!"
59,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52361054-alison,4,"This book could not be more timely given the current pandemic. The author covers contagion in disease as well as ideas (think “viral videos) and malware, including history around theories and understanding of contagion. I had high hopes but found that the book seemed to wander and lose its purpose around the final 1/3. And in the end my takeaway about contagion? “It’s complicated.” Oh and R = Duration * Opportunities * Transmission probability * Susceptibility."
60,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28983909-grant-ross,4,"A bit close to the topic of my PhD for me to really enjoy this as a book. The first chapter about the early days of the fight against malaria was particularly interesting. Additionally, the discussion on the uses and misuses of metrics was good as was the chapter on ways to use data to create more data and the ethics of that. Very well resourced. And pulls together a lot of disperate areas into one book. Although it was a little dry at times."
61,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34234161-jose-restrepo,5,"Timely and didactic, Kucharski takes us theough a crash course in epidemiology, explaining enough so that he doesn't have to oversimplify. He guides through the concepts using great examples and data. He then applies the concepts to problems that arent usually treated as epidemics in school or mass media. It was enlightening and easy to read. Recommended read for anyone who works with healthcare or is worried about problems that keep coming back (gun violence, disinformation)."
62,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27619244-ant,4,"A very “of the moment” choice of book. As a software engineer I found the correlation between viral, social of software contagion very interesting. The book gives a layman’s view of computer modelling and the history of disease outbreak study. Well written and entertaining.I’ve seen some reviews where the reader was disappointed that the book didn’t just concentrate on the pathogen outbreaks and instead showed how the mathematics of contagion apply to a variety of social issue (including crime, drug and marketing epidemics). So, I’d suggest entering into this book with an open mind and letting the author explain their field to you in their own manner. "
63,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104370134-oleksandr,4,Contagious bookAs we are facing coronavirus worldwide. I decided to read this book. The yellow page of the book strike's right away. I enjoyed reading the book especially on how the false media and false information can be spread online as much as any virus.4* only because some paragraphs were too rocket science for me.
64,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40604538-katarina-janoskova,4,"Great read. Hope Adam will write a follow up after this nightmare is over.I was especially interested in the electronic contagions, Internet is still fairly new, but we need to find ways to control its viruses and the crazy spread of misinformation, as well as targeting people by collecting data and showing lies in their faces (see Cambridge Analytica)."
65,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27588014-xavier-alexandre,3,"From a professional epidemiologist, a clear presentation of the rules of infection. Why infection rates eventually stall, and why you don't need to eradicate all the world's mosquitoes to stop paludism. The first part of the book is very informative. We can see that the same rules apply to infectious diseases, but also to rumours, fake news, and more.The second part includes lots of examples which are interesting from a historic perspective. But I was more interested in the formula that defines all contagions: R = D.O.T.S - worth a read."
66,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46049263-caroline-king,5,"This book was amazing and surprising! My favorite chapter was the one on the spread of computer viruses- so wild. This book should win an award for sharing scientific knowledge w the public- every thing I came across that could have been challenging was beautifully described. The pages on Bayesian methods are a perfect intro to anyone interested in them, ID-related or not. Highly recommend! "
67,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15827252-an-te,2,"The book starts on a good footing examining the spread of infectious diseases. Its contribution is strong in these areas. The excursis into other subjects is appreciated but ultimately not well done at all. The thesis was stretched too far. His overarching thesis could have been this: All things are connected, as far as I could tell. Nevertheless, it was informative."
68,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49770658-janine,5,"This is an excellent and timely book explaining the epidemiology of diseases. Seems apt it is read during the current pandemic. Another interesting aspect for me is the inclusion of malaria. Not just it hasn't been a research interest of mine, but, a local man called Patrick Manson who was born 17 miles away from where I live was a welcome (geddit!) addition.Excellent book"
69,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64237642-bethany,4,"I was honestly expecting more about disease and how it spreads, but this was really interesting. I enjoyed the writing style and the cadence of the writing. The book is well thought out and based on scientific research, which I appreciate. This would be a particularly interesting read for those who have an interest in politics and the spread of ideas."
70,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103679537-grace-li,4,"Interesting and incredibly timely book. Rather than focusing on infectious diseases alone, many anecdotes are taken from finance and the social sciences. A good introduction to some of the concepts used in political science from which health policy could borrow, particularly to tackle the sticky problem of the anti-vax movement."
71,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434174-alok,5,"The Rules of Contagion: Why *Things* Spread - and Why They StopA refreshing read with interesting take on similar underlying connections to seemingly different ""things"".""things"" : diseases, financial crisis, crimes, habits, ideas, viral internet memes and trends, malware, genetic information, culture etc."
72,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51349190-michael-knolla,4,The initial material in the book is both compelling and timely but for me the book lost most of its momentum when the focus shifted to the internet. It isn’t that the material there isn’t value-add (particularly in dispelling many misperceptions that arise from the improper importing of terms from biological contagion) just that it lacks the verge of the earlier material. This may be a result of the material in these subjects relying less on the author’s own experience.
73,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51838393-arthur-thomas,5,"Complex issues can hold amazing surprises and Kucharski shows what they can be. Diseases, social media, and politics have similarities that will surprise and entertain you. You don't need advanced schooling to understand what he has to say. You might want to consider taking an online class to learn a bit more."
74,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4338062-catreader,4,"With a title that sounds like a Chip and Dan Heath book and memetic-inspired content that seems to follow from Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, this is an interesting, interdisciplinary book that ties together elements of contagion from pandemics to the virality of social media. It's definitely a unique approach I hadn't considered before."
75,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95327110-joe-j,5,"I enjoyed this one as it talked about why trends, viruses and the likes spread in society. It made me think and curious for more information and that is all I can ask for out of books. The author is a scientist that specializes in infectious diseases, but the lessons learned and talked about are universal. "
76,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1455402-lee,5,"Eye opening (and timely for COVIDS-19) description of the power of statistical modelling for outbreaks - health and otherwise. Also dwells on why models can be perceived as weak, usually because of pitfalls in data collection. A warning on what could go wrong. "
77,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53677031-darya,4,"Thinking of epidemia, pandemics or viral media effect there may be found some similarities and very interesting facts. I found very important the amount of research experiments and other live examples presented in this book. The book provokes deep thoughts on how the world around us functions."
78,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85629050-fabio,4,"A book with very interesting ideas and concepts, but the overall flow is the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars. The book jumps between various concepts and anecdotes but struggles to build an overall narrative to follow. "
79,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18274101-jeremy-hill,5,"Very timely and usefulReading this in pandemic lockdown, and working in a global bank, the key elements of the book come into sharp focus. If only it were not already too late to have learnt the lessons from all of the apposite examples. "

81,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42915709-hugh-nguyen,5,Entertaining book which is a hell of a lot more relevant than the author guessed when he was writing it. Otherwise he probably wouldn't have spent so much of it trying to make an otherwise dry subject relevant by drawing correlations with online viral content.
82,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617960-miss-c,2,"I bought this book thinking it would be just about disease however it talks about data, computer viruses and violence as well as other things. At times I was interested however some of it I found hard work, interesting but not what I expected."
83,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67008519-the-inquisitive-biologist,5,The Rules of Contagion is an incredibly engaging piece of cross-disciplinary popular science that will hold its relevance well beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

84,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51103543-richard-lawson,3,"A bit disappointingI was expecting more from this book, but to be honest I don't feel as though I learnt very much. It lacked structure, with each chapter feeling quite similar and jumping about somewhat. "
85,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9543345-betsy,5,"Although I really enjoyed my epidemiology class in grad school, this book was eye opening. Author covered mosquitoes, microorganims, and social media. Some of the analysis used math to tie it back to outbreaks and contagion so it may have been over my head 😹Will probably read it again 😹"
86,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,5,"This was a beautiful companion to Richard Dawkins' writings on memes, because Kucharski explains nicely the parallels between biological pathogens and cultural behaviors, like violence trends, political ideas, etc."
87,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/677158-michelle,4,"Well, if this book wasn’t perfectly timed for publication, I don’t know what was. The author uses theories related to the spread of disease to discuss economic, social and digital issues. It was fascinating and intelligently written. "
88,1788160193,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1942220-mike,5,"Excellent examination of how things spread; knowledge, propaganda and, of course, viruses. COVID-19 was just beginning when the book was finished. Sad proof that a little leadership would have gone a long way in getting a handle on the pandemic."
