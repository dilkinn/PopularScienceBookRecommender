0,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice,5,"EXCERPT: Up until that first day as a junior doctor, I had never met death outside of my own family, other than in the detached, leather cadavers of the dissection room and in the neat rituals of a post-mortem. As a medic, I had never found myself face to face with the end of someone's life, at least not one that didn't rest quietly upon a stainless steel table, but still I went to the ward on that day to fulfill my first task as a junior doctor feeling more than prepared for the experience. And I did know how to feel for a pulse and how to look for signs of respiratory effort. I did know how to check for the presence of a pacemaker and fill out the death certificate. I had been taught all of this, and I could deal with it. But what I couldn't deal with, and what I didn't know, was how I would feel walking into a room at the end of someone's life and seeing all the small details around that room that told me who this person was. The small details that told me this person's story. The bag of knitting and the get-well cards, the half-eaten pack of Polo Mints, and the puzzle books. It was the paperback on the bedside table that stayed with me more than anything else. Closed shut, its bookmark resting forevermore halfway through a story. I took the sight of that paperback and kept it with me. It joined other small details I collected on the wards as I went through my days, not realizing that it was the weight of these details that would eventually break me. ABOUT THIS BOOK: An intimate, urgent account of doctor burnout and life as a psychiatrist from bestselling author Joanna Cannon""A few years ago, I found myself in A&E.I had never felt so ill. I was mentally and physically broken. So fractured, I hadn't eaten properly or slept well, or even changed my expression for months. I sat in a cubicle, behind paper-thin curtains, listening to the rest of the hospital happen around me, and I shook with the effort of not crying. I was an inch away from defeat, from the acceptance of a failure I assumed would be inevitable, but I knew I had to carry on. I had to somehow walk through it.Because I wasn't the patient. I was the doctor.""A frank account of mental health from both sides of the doctor-patient divide, from the bestselling author of The Trouble with Goats and Sheep and Three Things About Elsie, based on her own experience as a doctor working on a psychiatric ward.MY THOUGHTS: I admire Joanna Cannon greatly. I loved her novels, Three Things About Elsie, and The Difference Between Goats and Sheep. Now I understand how she can write like she does, with such great empathy and understanding. I have worked in both general and psychiatric nursing in New Zealand, as well as in private practice. I have seen a lot of people, both nurses and doctors, burn out for the same reasons - the hours, the stress, the lack of care and concern for those who care for the ill and dying. People revere actors and sports stars, but are often rude and dismissive of those who save lives. Somewhere, we have managed to get our priorities wrong. Breaking & Mending is a short but emotional read. This is, as it says in the promotional blurb, 'an intimate account' of a woman's determination to become a doctor, and what happens on her journey. Next time I need a doctor, I hope that I get a 'cardigan', not a 'coat'.Thank you Joanna, for sharing your journey with us. I admire you even more than I did before I read Breaking &Mending. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§#Breaking&Mending #NetGalley THE AUTHOR: Joanna Cannon is the author of the Sunday Times bestselling debut novel The Trouble with Goats and Sheep, which has sold over 250,000 copies in the UK alone and has been published in 15 countries.

1,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60964126-ceecee,5,"What an emotional and extremely moving memoir this is from best selling author Dr Joanna Cannon. This describes her experiences as an older medical student and a junior doctor and it is a gripping read. First of all, her story of how she got to apply to be a medical student is positively inspiring and she is living proof that if you want something badly enough, that you are prepared to work hard and have the right mindset then you can achieve anything. She was the ‚Äòwild card‚Äô entry for her year. She tells some amazing stories of people who help her overcome some of the difficulties of training such as your first dissection and how she came to see the body as miraculous. She describes how she learned from her patients the right words, the right sort of kindness, how to deal with trauma and how to deliver the worst news. A lot of this is heartbreaking and at times jaw dropping and you realise that sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to have nerves of steel but at the end of the day, they are human and whilst they help mend if they can, they also break. Junior doctors workload is well known and in the NHS they must run on adrenaline as they are frequently exhausted and as if we didn‚Äôt know it already, Covid 19 demonstrates their burden is huge and they often cannot fix problems. One things the author says really resonates with me - junior doctors begin their rotations in August which is said to be the worst time as a patient to appear at hospital. She says that‚Äôs wrong as they are fresh, they‚Äôre not exhausted and their brains are crammed with up to date knowledge, I totally agree. One gorgeous, young junior doctor, one August asked the right questions and noticed a symptom my mother presented with that two consultants had failed to observe over an eighteen month period. We got a diagnosis, it wasn‚Äôt what we hoped for but we now knew, so the authors words struck a real chord with me. She talks of developing a sixth sense with patients and that echoes with me as a teacher, we too develop it with experience and like in medicine, it nips things in the bud. I love how she talks so wonderfully about her patients, it‚Äôs so apparent she cares and has oodles of warmth and is a very compassionate doctor and without spoiling this excellent read, they aren‚Äôt all bursting with it. Overall, an absolute gem of a book which unites her literary career with her medical one as medicine is about stories. It‚Äôs a very well written book too. I love her gratitude to those who help her, you feel the brutal pressure, the just hanging on by your fingernails in order to survive, the debilitating toll that working for the NHS can take but also it‚Äôs humanity, it‚Äôs care, that it gives hope, that it reassures, that it‚Äôs kind, it‚Äôs teamwork and it‚Äôs there for us 24 hours a day. A resounding thank you to her and to the many thousands of others who have recently risked their lives for us. üåàThank you üåàWith thanks to NetGalley and Serpents Tale/Profile Books for the ARC in return for an honest review."
2,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44095345-carmel-hanes,4,"""I was told compassion is something to be desired and applauded. But compassion will eat away at your sanity. It will make you pull up in a lay-by on the journey home, because you can no longer see the road for the tears. It will creep through your mind in the darkness, and keep you from your sleep, and you will find that the cloth from which you are cut will begin to suffocate you.""""This disapproval of emotional reaction exists in everyday life too. Certain corners of society maintain a particular distaste for anyone displaying emotion, anyone who admits they are overwhelmed or unable to cope....we are expected to somehow absorb our feelings and our responses to life, to banish them far from the surface of who we seem to be, because their disappearance makes it so much easier for everyone else. In medicine, it's seen as almost mandatory.""These are not words we often hear a doctor speak. Instead, we hear matter-of-fact diagnostic information in confident tones. We hear recommendations and statistics. We hear pronouncements about how much time we might have left, after disease carves away our essence. Occasionally, if we are lucky, a cold message might have kind eyes accompanying it with a quick pat on the hand. We tend to put doctors on pedestals, expecting competence and unemotional information. We expect them to be superhuman in conducting their business. We forget that beneath the stethoscope and white coats is a human being, subject to all the same frailties we experience. This book is an emotional autopsy on how wrong we can be, and how destructive the demands of medicine, and the medical community, can be on those who lead with compassion. It's an honest and raw assessment of how our nature can be so out of sync with our job that it buries us in doubt and pain. ""...but while doctors are meant to lean back, far away from the abyss, it is a basic human reflex to reach across--to discover a connection, a common ground, to find something of yourself in other people. I reached across because it felt like the most natural thing to do.""Reaching across is the most natural thing to do, but it comes at a cost. The human heart can only carry so much and then it begins to crumble. And what if you work (or live) in an environment that doesn't allow you to show you're crumbling? Cannon explores the isolation and alienation that results from walking among others who fail to notice, fail to see that you are drowning; or worse, see it and criticize instead of offering assistance and understanding. This book captures the phenomenon of ""compassion fatigue"", and would be of interest to anyone who has worked in a helping profession--nurses, doctors, counselors, teachers, medics, firefighters, police officers. People go into these professions with a desire to help others, but that responsibility, over time, can erode our well-being. Cannon found her way out of the darkness, but recognizes not everyone does. This story hit home, for I, too, have experienced that fatigue and know how utterly empty one can begin to feel.""Perhaps each of us is just searching for the right landscape and for our somewhere to belong, searching for the right place to tell our stories, in the hope that someone out there will listen and we will be understood.""Amen. It's important to look more carefully at each other, and to reach across the abyss when we see someone falling behind."

By reading the paperback Breaking and Mending I found out the pressure that Joanna went through being a junior doctor. One thing that will stay with me about Joanna Cannon is how kind and caring she was when a patient died. If you buy this book do please make sure you have a box of tissues ready. I'm going to pass my book to my daughter who works in a doctors surgery, she knows full well that the NHS are under strain, and that is one of the topics that Joanna talks about in her book. I have to recommend Breaking and Mending. It's one of those books to keep forever. So when I let my daughter read this book, I will want it back. "

This factor, combined with unsympathetic senior doctors and the pressures of NHS bureaucracy, left her vulnerable to compassion fatigue and a physical and mental breakdown.However, her special talent for close observation and listening to the patients‚Äô stories, which was discouraged on the overworked and understaffed NHS wards, became an invaluable skill when she finally achieved her ambition of working with psychiatric patients. Adam Kay Covers much of the same ground in his humorous medical memoir ‚ÄòThis is Going to Hurt‚Äô ‚Äì the dysfunctional administration of a shamefully underfunded national health care system which fails to take care of the health of its own staff. Both pay tribute to the unsung heroes - the doctors and nurses who give their utmost in making patients lives bearable in traumatic circumstances. I would greatly recommend both of these memoirs to everyone who has had occasion to use the National Health Service (which must be virtually all living in the UK) and especially to those idealists thinking of practising medicine."
5,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,5,"‚ÄúMedicine is a vocation, not a job, we are often told. The reality is, it is both, but when the conditions of the job become unbearable, when the demands made of us are likely to put our own lives at risk, not to mention the lives of the patients in our care, we are expected to continue to bear it because of a deep-rooted sense of purpose. A calling to serve and heal, and to fix.‚ÄùBreaking and Mending is a book by award-winning British doctor and author, Joanna Cannon. Whenever we or our loved ones visit the emergency department of a hospital, or are admitted, we put our health, and often our lives, in the hands of the medical staff there, many of whom are junior doctors. But few of us, unless we work in the system or are close to those who do, understand the pressure that system puts on those doctors. Dr Jo Cannon is in the unique position of having experienced that system, having been a casualty of it, and having the literary skill to be able to succinctly share that experience: ‚ÄúEach time I read that another doctor has vanished from their life , that someone else has felt the need to disappear from this landscape, it takes my breath away for a moment, because it could have been any one of us. It most definitely could have been me, as I sat there in an A& E cubicle trying to work out how a job I had been so determined to do, and so desperate to be good at, had turned itself into my nemesis.‚ÄùDr Jo describes exactly how the system drives these dedicated professionals to breakdown, to leave the vocation they loved, to take their own lives. She points out that the conditions under which junior doctors work (sleep deprived and meal deprived) present danger, not just for the doctor and the patients they treat, but also for road users as they drag themselves home on auto-pilot. ‚ÄúFor all their training, for all their knowledge and expertise in sustaining good health, attending to their own well-being is something that doctors are not especially good at‚Ä¶ Look after yourself, we are told and then we are placed in a situation where self-care is impossible, and even seen by some as unpleasantly self-indulgent.‚ÄùDr Jo includes pertinent quotes from many involved in the process: the admissions tutor. the lecturer, the medical student, the junior doctor, the consultant, the nurse, the ward sister, the patient, and the mental health nurse, as she relates her journey towards her ultimately satisfying role in psychiatry.As well as the strong message about the need for change to the system, for better mentoring and less pressure, Dr Jo treats the reader to some marvellous prose: ‚Äúwe should all choose our words with more care because we never know the scales with which they will be measured‚Äù and ‚Äúwe stalk the hospital looking for examples , our pens poised over our workbooks, like medical birdwatchers‚Äù are some.Also ‚ÄúI knew these were the things patients say when they‚Äôre told a diagnosis: offering them piece by piece to the teller, as if evidence of the unfairness and the unlikeliness of it all will make the diagnosis realise its mistake, change its mind and walk away‚Äù The pressure from the system is clearly not unique to Britain as Australian doctor Sonia Henry‚Äôs excellent novel, Going Under attests. A sobering and very important read.This unbiased review is from an uncorrected proof copy provided by NetGalley and Serpent‚Äôs Tail."

7,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68793530-sandra-armor,5,"Just finished the audiobook of #BreakingandMending read by the author, @JoannaCannon. An intensely moving memoir. I sobbed at several of the patient stories. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but reinforces how much we owe to all those who care for us when we cannot. A must read or listen."
8,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45911840-alice-elizabeth-marriedtobooks,5,"Wow... I can't even begin to type my review up without feeling a little emotional. I've read quite a few medical memoirs in my lifetime, however, none truly hit me in the way that Breaking & Mending did. This follows Joanna as she studies at medical school as a mature student and then works in a busy hospital ward, having to navigate difficult patients and staff with some truly heartbreaking moments. The writing style came across as a casual conversation, like Joanna herself was sitting next to me and physically describing her life. A must-read!"
9,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anni,5,"‚ÄúI learned that returning a life to someone very often has nothing to do with restoring a heartbeat.‚ÄùJoanna Cannon is a consummate storyteller, having had two best selling novels under her belt ‚Äì and her gift for writing is amply demonstrated in this profoundly moving memoir of her training as a doctor and early medical career.She was chosen by the Medical School admissions professor as a ‚Äòwild card‚Äô candidate to study medicine ‚Äì a mature student without the usual privileged educational background.We shadow her through all the rigours of medical school and her days and nights on the wards of NHS hospitals, sharing glimpses of the hidden world behind the scenes ‚Äì and screens ‚Äì of hospital wards which is usually concealed from patients, and discovering the secret code in the nurse's mysterious message ‚Äòa package for Rose Cottage‚Äô.Eventually, Cannon‚Äôs caring, empathetic nature with patients made it difficult to maintain a professional distance.

Highly recommended."
10,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,0,"I read the first 30 pages and skimmed another 12. Cannon left school at 15 and came to medicine late, starting her training in her 30s. Her father had died not long before then, and she initially had trouble with dissections because it reminded her of his dead body, the last she‚Äôd seen previously. A compassionate registrar got her involved in hospital autopsies so she could become used to being around corpses.I‚Äôve read so many doctors‚Äô memoirs now, and this one doesn‚Äôt really cut the mustard: the writing is undistinguished and the tone as sentimental as I‚Äôve come to expect from her novels. I should have known after The Trouble with Goats and Sheep that there was no point in reading more by Cannon, but I thought the subject matter would be enough to make it stand out for me.Lines I liked: ‚ÄúI am very often asked about the similarities between being a doctor and being an author, and the answer is very simple. Writing always rests on a narrative, on hearing a voice, and it‚Äôs exactly the same for medicine‚Äù."
11,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21582652-emma,5,"I finished the last sentence of ‚ÄòBreaking & Mending‚Äô and sat in silence, once again in complete and utter awe of Joanna Cannon. I have been a huge fan ever since I read an early proof copy of ‚ÄòThe Trouble With Goats and Sheep‚Äô. Joanna Cannon‚Äôs skill with words always amazes me. She is an author who has that rare ability of conveying so many things in just one five word sentence. As someone who always waffles and scrambles around for the right words, I am always amazed by those people who select the perfect words with ease. Though I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt always feel easy at the time!Joanna Cannon came to medicine in her thirties with the ambition of specialising in psychiatry, and she was the ‚Äòwild card‚Äô of her medical school year. A wild card she may have been, but a more perfect human to go into a career healing people there couldn‚Äôt have been. This deeply moving memoir perfectly illustrates her compassion for her patients, her endless ability to listen to them, her pain when the patients who have become friends pass away and her honesty about how bone crushingly desperate and broken many, many junior doctors become.But this isn‚Äôt a book just about doctors, it is also about the patients. Every single one mentioned, and I‚Äôm sure there are many more that haven‚Äôt, have been carried around in Joanna Cannon‚Äôs heart and thoughts for many many years. I found myself getting choked up many a time, especially towards the end of the book where we hear about the compassion patients have for each other. They are all suffering unimaginable pain yet they can still hold a hand out to help someone. That is something that will stay with me and it is a lesson that people should hold with them everyday.‚ÄòBreaking & Mending‚Äô moved me to tears more than once. The stories that are shared with us are emotional, raw, heartbreaking but they are also life changing, full of hope and inspiration. These stories will make you think differently about the doctors you see walking the hospital corridors but also about the people you see everyday. You don‚Äôt know what battles people are fighting, a little kindness costs nothing.If I was a person that used a highlighter whilst reading, my entire copy would be a glowing florescent yellow now! But I can‚Äôt do that to a book, instead pretty much every single page has a tiny post-it note to show the sections that really touched my soul. Every section touched my soul! The writing is just phenomenal, as I‚Äôve already mentioned, there are single sentences that convey so much in so few words. There are so many lines that are quote-worthy! I read this book in one greedy sitting, but I will return to it because I need to bask in it‚Äôs glory just a little bit more.Thank you Joanna Cannon for writing this book. This wonderful wonderful book. It was an absolute pleasure and honour to read it and it will stay in my heart forever. And to everyone reading this review, I implore you, read the book!"
12,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,5,"I was familiar with Joanna Cannon as the author of two popular novels. I didn't know she was a doctor. I discovered her novels through my favorite book blogger Simon Savidge, and he also alerted me to this excellent memoir.Cannon decided to become a doctor when she was in her 30's. Medical training in the UK is quite different from the US. The education begins after secondary school in the UK, while in US, students must have a 4 year degree, usually in pre-med studies such as biology or chemistry. However, in both countries, medical students are overworked and sometimes (too often) bullied by senior doctors. Cannon suffered a great deal of non-supportive treatment that she had to overcome to achieve her goal.Through her various experiences in hospitals, Cannon realized that the NHS, a system she had always valued, was deteriorating. Underfunded and with growing patient loads, it appears to be moving towards collapse. I don't live in the UK, and I can't evaluate the condition of health care under NHS. I have friends in the UK who have praised it and others who have had bad experiences. Throughout her education, Cannon demonstrated a high degree of true compassion. She shares better ways to respond to patients, and to share bad news. Eventually, she decides that she will specialize in psychiatry. Every specialization has its challenges and rewards. Some require more years to qualify and pay levels vary widely. If nothing else, this memoir raised my admiration for those who go into medicine, including nurses (my mother, and her sister were nurses). This audiobook was wonderfully narrated by the author. Highly recommended."
13,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,4,"One of the most important things that one can do as a healthcare worker is to connect, to bear witness to the horrible things that cross the threshold into your office or clinic or hospital daily, to take on the sheer weight of the world that you see every single day. This book covers this impossible task in a beautiful way, looking into the exhausting world of constant compassion and the necessity of caring for patients whilst maintaining some semblance of your own mental health. I had no prior experience with the author, so reading this book as a first experience was lovely. The writing is lyrical and keeps you held close to what is happening- the empathy that she holds in her heart for those she cares for is overwhelming. We're privileged to live in a Commonwealth where healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and so these recent volumes from various authors about the pitfalls of the NHS and Medicare are very necessary- they show us the underbelly of how hard all doctors work to save lives. I especially loved reading about the card she received from a sister of one of the patients- it's things like that that keep people going.I think the story of the night shift where the supervising doctor simply walked off will stay with me for a long time. To be in such a vulnerable position must be awful, and to have to manage it with only ten days under your belt a real-life horror story. I can only hope that books like this bring attention to the fact that doctors are as human as the rest of us, and it is so necessary to care for them as such. "
14,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura,4,"Although a relatively short read compared to its counterparts, this was an overall enjoyable read following one woman‚Äôs decision to retrain and become a doctor well into her thirties. There isn‚Äôt a huge amount of detail given about the authors background, which I would have liked to have seen more of to build a bigger picture of who she is. However, she goes on to eloquently describe the process of medical school and her first terrifying months as a medical student and then as a junior doctor. Having worked in the NHS in a nursing capacity, I can empathise with so much of this book and how healthcare professionals become burnt out quickly due to lack of staff and resources. This would be an excellent choice for NHS managers and politicians to read. "
15,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22204238-jules,5,"As a paramedic, this book massively resonated with me, especially in relation to dealing with suicide, and the feelings of inadequacy. Jo is brilliant at writing about people and their emotions & I felt my eyes filling with tears at several points. I do think I found it more emotional because I can relate to it, but I certainly recommend a read. It‚Äôs a book that will stay with me for a very, very long time. "

17,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2095931-jacki-julia-flyte,5,"I knew that Joanna Cannon was a novelist but I did not know that in her 30s she trained as a doctor and worked in psychiatry. This is a memoir about her time working in the NHS, a job which caused her to burnout. It covers similar territory to This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, and both are excellent but they are quite different in tone. The easiest way to explain the difference is to think about how Adam Kay now works as a comedian while Joanna Cannon works as a novelist. So Kay's book tended to focus on short anecdotes and amusing stories (although also he also includes stories that aren't amusing at all, and that change in tone helps to make them more powerful). Cannon's book is more about her internal journey and about people she encountered whose stories stayed with her. She has a novelists's eye for the descriptive details that anchor you in the situation. Kay's book moved me, but Cannon's made me cry. She cares about the lives of her patients, to the point where it is at the expense of her own mental health. She spends off duty hours sitting by patients and keeping them company. She cries when they die. And somehow she has turned that into a memoir that is not self-promoting and that is more beautiful than it is grim."
18,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25777210-callum-mclaughlin,4,"This anecdotal memoir focusses on Cannon‚Äôs time spent as a junior doctor, working on both A&E and psychiatric wards. Its primary aim is to humanise the overworked and underappreciated staff who keep the NHS afloat in times of unrest and austerity, and to explore the ethical grey area between maintaining professional protocol and extending the hand of human kindness. From heart-breakingly tender interactions with patients, to moments of gut-punch trauma, she highlights the physical and emotional burnout that comes with the job. By doing so, she shows us why it‚Äôs imperative we stop seeing health workers as miraculous, indomitable heroes, and start treating them like the fallible human beings they are, by putting better support systems in place.Cannon‚Äôs writing style is gentle and approachable. Though she doesn‚Äôt shy away from how devastating life as a doctor (and a patient) can be, she never loses the spark of hope that things can get better. She argues that transparency and storytelling are our best means of encouraging the kind of open dialogue that will birth positive change. Here, she leads by example."

Not only because it had an interesting premise but because Dr Joanna Cannon is the author of one of my favourite books that I've read this year ""Three Things About Elsie"" and I couldn't wait to delve into her memoir of being a junior doctor. This book is definitely not a fluffy, rose-tinted look at junior doctors. This is a memoir filled with¬†gritty tales and insightful stories of what a junior doctor goes through to get were they are. It made me respect and appreciate the workers of the NHS a lot more. This was a more in-depth and personal account from someone who has had first hand experience at it. It humanises the doctors that we take for granted, they are not robots who mend and heal us. They are like us, human with feelings and emotions. This is a book that everyone needs to buy and read. Take a moment in your life to make sense of those that save lives."

24,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88031475-novelle-novels,5,5 out of 5 stars This is a Doctors true story and one of highs and lows. Dr cannon decided to be a doctor later in life than many of her colleagues but her big heart made her perfect for the job. After being in hospital and dealing with different doctors she is someone I would have loved to have treat me as she talks about the importance of really listening.
25,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5754996-kayleigh,3,"Joanna Cannon‚Äôs short reflections on being a junior doctor is moving, heartwarming and insightful. She depicts the wards, surgeries and even the mortuary in a way that highlights the humanity in these places. Through short, sharp chapters, opening with a thought or anecdote from various medical professionals, Cannon talks about a number of different interactions she‚Äôs had with both patients and colleagues during her time as a medical student and also as a doctor. She jumps from one anecdote to another in seamless transitions always bringing home a message or a learning from that experience and making it relatable to her readers. I loved hearing her talk about her patients. There is a real warmth and affection in Cannon‚Äôs writing that corroborates what she says in the book about being the kind of person who becomes a doctor because of the people. I enjoyed her discussing the medical side of the job but this was done rarely and in a way that was easy to understand. She focuses a lot more on the emotional side of the job. Her coming to accept the things she sees in her patients every day, working such long, taxing hours and dealing with some unpleasant people. At one point in the book Cannon works in a psychiatric ward and her honest reflections on this experience were succinct yet very resonant. I really loved Cannon‚Äôs writing throughout the whole book, she was very open about the experiences and the hardships she faced, not afraid to discuss the things that to other people may be taboo. All of the people she mentioned in the book felt whole and I had an emotional connection to all of them, often making me tear up. Once I reached the end I did feel that the last couple of chapters felt a little rushed. I felt that the end was abrupt and that I really wanted more, more discussion of how and why Cannon decided to leave medicine and what this looked like. I had the overall feeling at the end that the book felt unfinished or that it maybe needed more. Possibly elaborating on the discussion at the beginning and the end of joining the medical profession and leaving it would have solved this for me. Despite that, this was still a very enjoyable reading experience. I loved the insights into a job I know very little about and Cannon‚Äôs writing is always a winner for me."
26,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11157989-martha,4,"Breaking & Mending is the latest in what feels like a conveyor belt of medical memoirs but I am happy to say that it holds its amongst those that I have read so far (This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor & With the End in Mind: Dying, Death, and Wisdom in an Age of Denial).Joanna Cannon was a 'wildcard' into her medical education, a mature student much older than those around her, having taken her time to decide what she wanted to do with her life. This is the account of her time as a junior doctor, a story (as she names it) of compassion and burnout. Told in short vignette-style chapters, Cannon recounts example after example of a system thoroughly broken - from being left to run a night shift three weeks in, to being screamed at by consultants charged with supervising her education. Through all of this, she weaves stories of patients, stories of compassion in the most heartbreaking circumstances, and the toll they take on the medical staff who must move on to the next case (on no sleep or food and without any pastoral care).I found Cannon's writing to be lyrical and profound, and it reminded me a lot Kathryn Mannix's With the End in Mind: Dying, Death, and Wisdom in an Age of Denial and Maggie O'Farrell's I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes with Death. The comparisons with Adam Kay are also inevitable but the two are complementary rather than duplicative. Breaking & Mending doesn't contain the same kind of laugh-out-loud anecdotes (and it doesn't need them), but the two come together as part of a growing voice of medical professionals screaming at us to notice that our beloved NHS is broken. Both remind us that doctors are people and funding cuts from successive governments means that the whole system is dependent on a decreasing number of doctors (and all of the other staff) surrendering their health and wellbeing to keep it running, with devastating consequences.The only criticism I have of this book is that it felt incomplete in terms of Cannon's personal story. To be clear, I don't believe that any author owes us their personal story unless they want to give it, but this book begins with Cannon in A&E at breaking point without ever finding out what it was that drove her there on that day and what happened next. It's a very personal moment to describe, so a reticence to reveal personal details doesn't seem to apply here. Was this the moment that made her leave the profession or was it something else? Did anyone notice? Who helped her? Has she been able to move on? It's a bold way to start a book, but without the resolution, it felt almost like clickbait to yank us in without giving the full story. In the context of the whole book, it's a minor detail. I would very much recommend this to anyone, all of us can use a reminder of the importance of compassion and that doctors are very much people too."
27,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6779519-sophie,5,"This is a relatively short book but so incredibly overwhelming that it took me several sittings to get through it and it left me with plenty to think about. At the heart, it‚Äôs the personal story of one person as they begin medical school and grapple with the differences between the ideology and reality of being a junior doctor. The emotional side of the job is really explored here, an area that is often forgotten or overlooked.Cannon doesn‚Äôt avoid criticism of the system and the status quo either, to the point she expresses concerns that she‚Äôll put people off applying for medical school! But, while the NHS is wonderful that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be improved and I think it‚Äôs essential to have these discussions. Burnout is a real problem and we often lose track of the individual behind the doctors (or other health professional) title. More needs to be done to ensure we don‚Äôt lose good, compassionate doctors, like Cannon, to burnout and support them to have long and fulfilling careers.For anyone working in our healthcare system this is a must read. Despite it being a very personal account, I‚Äôm certain that many areas of it will ring true for others."
28,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne,5,"I have followed Joanna Cannon's writing journey for a long time now. I used to read her blog and was always touched by her ability to portray such emotion, and such compassion through her writing.I think most people know her story; she wrote her first novel during her breaks when she was working as a psychiatrist in a busy NHS hospital. That book was The Trouble with Goats and Sheep; one of my favourite books of recent years. Her second novel; Three Things About Elsie was another huge success.Whilst I do know a lot of Joanna's back story, and have been lucky enough to meet her on more than one occasion, I was excited to learn that she was publishing this memoir, about her time as a junior doctor.Breaking and Mending is not a long book. It's just 166 pages in total, but every single word is perfect. There were times when I had to put the book aside and gather my thoughts, and reign in my emotions. It is one of the most beautifully written books that I've ever had the pleasure to read.Joanna's experiences as a junior doctor are not unique to her. I'm positive that most doctors would read this book and nod their heads in recognition. I've worked in NHS related jobs for many years and have seen the effects of the unrelenting work load on the professionals that I sit alongside.However, I doubt that there are many other doctors who could put their feelings into words such as these. Joanna Cannon's ability to convey every feeling, every emotion and every single moment of hope, desperation and frustration is utterly compelling and so powerfully done.Joanna Cannon was an 'older' medical student; deciding to undertake her medical training much later in life than most people. She was given a 'wild card' by the admitting Consultant; given a place at medical school despite her doubts about what she was doing. We follow her through her journey as a brand new student; as she undertakes placements; as she works her first shift as the only doctor on duty.Writing with honesty and clarity, and pulling no punches, this author clearly details the immense pressure that our dedicated and treasured medical staff come under. It is a both shocking, and thought-provoking and it is my hope that it conveys to all readers the incredible dedication that drives most doctors who carry on their work despite often horrendous conditions and pressures.As with this author's fiction, she uses her words to create the most wonderful imagery, this passage from the book particularly moved me:'There are some rooms in a hospital which are designed for delivering bad news or made especially for people to sit in whilst they wait to receive it ........................ Good news is allowed to wander around freely and stretch its legs. It's allowed to travel through cubicle curtains and make its way around the ward and be heard by anyone who might happen to walk by. It's bad news that needs to be contained. Trapped. Kept tightly enclosed in a small room with four easy chairs and a coffee table, just in case it should manage to escape and be heard forever.'Painfully honest, harrowing, heart-breaking and so so human. Breaking and Mending is a book that must be read by everyone who ever has any contact with our NHS."

In her memoir we follow along as she confronts her first post mortem, witnessing those final moments of life. She discovers that in the enormity of saving lives it is the spaces in between, the words we use and the small acts of kindness that have power to mend.Yet, the faith we place in our doctors is only limited by their own humanity. For their own care is as important as the patients they tend.Cannon pushed her luck when she stated ‚Äò...please don‚Äôt reject me just because of my date of birth‚Äô The professor obviously saw that she had a passion for medicine. Cannon was older than many students yet brought life experience having pulled pints and worked with animals. She realized that helping people is understanding their voice and hearing their story.Cannon describes how she struggled with the very reality of medicine when faced with a human body in situ. But that struggle demonstrated to one colleague ‚Äò...what a good doctor you‚Äôll make‚Äô. Cannon enters the profession with a passion for helping people. She meets Joan, the feisty blind 79 old pensioner with learning difficulties and a selective hearing aid. Gill, Cannon‚Äôs virtual twin facing the end with cancer. But she does so whilst entering the NHS under stress, underfunding and mismanagement. In the chapter ‚ÄòThe Darkest Hour‚Äô - Cannon describes on her 10th day when her registrar walks out to catch a flight. She faced the next 6 hours as the Head Doctor to the entire hospital. She survives the night but the profession protects their own with an expectation to put up and shut up.Gruelling as it is, she discovers that it‚Äôs the spaces in between where the healing takes place. The value of words in itself is crucial. A senior consultant tells her: ‚ÄòSaying you‚Äôre sorry is a value statement. Those are heavy words‚Äô. The space that exists between patient and medic is there for a reason. As much for the professional‚Äôs wellbeing as the patient. To Cannon, Psychiatry saved her. Instead of continually chastised for talking to much, she is told to talk to the patients. It‚Äôs here she sees where the smallest of kind acts, helps not only the giver and receiver but those who witness it. Even with just a cup of tea.The science of medicine is immense but nothing is guaranteed. Doctors carry great responsibility within a profession constantly under stress. Yet, Cannon moving account demonstrates that the wellbeing of the doctor is an important as the patient. That the smallest acts go very, very far. 10/10"

It‚Äôs to do with being human‚ÄôThis is a memoir about Joanna Cannon‚Äôs experiences as a junior doctor in the NHS. She describes everything from the very beginning of her medical career - throughout medical school, her first days as a junior doctor and her transition through to psychiatry.I absolutely LOVED this book. It was heartbreaking, touching and extremely emotional and I flew through it. You learn about the day-to-day experiences that all of our Doctors and Nurses go through each shift, and the impact this has on their mental wellbeing. Not having enough time sleep, eat or even drink. The emotional weight that comes with trying to help each patient, when sometimes there is no solution.I recommend everyone to read this book.

As a patient I thought I might on occasion have a slightly different perspective or even conclusion. The first chapter or so is quite challenging for those who perhaps have depressive friends and I did wonder who I might recommend it too. But thinking and talking about it made me realise that there were a couple of extraordinary attributes to this book. The descriptions and language are stunning. The other attribute was the generosity of Dr Cannon‚Äôs view of those around her: those who helped her both colleagues and patients. It‚Äôs thought provoking and a very good challenge.

I'm currently studying medicine, and it's the first medicine-related book I've ever read, and it was a perfect match.This is a beautiful memoir about Joanna, a doctor who decided to study later in her life, but this never stopped her from following her passion.It deals with her journey from her first lecture, to the time she found her 'family' in psychiatry. She explores how these years shaped her into the doctor she is today and the emotional part of her job. How emotions are often ignored in the medical field because sometimes you can know the rarest of diseases but cannot find a way to cope with the death of a patient.She talks about her first visit to the mortuary, the excitement of looking at people when you know anatomy. Learning how to talk with patients and use the right kindness. How self-doubt made her think she didn't deserve to be there but then finding motivation in patients and the desire to make even the tiniest of difference. And last but not least what inspired her to pursue psychiatry (one of the things I'd love to do as a doctor).It is beautifully written, in fact, I highlighted entire paragraphs that are just so lovely that I want to read them again and again.Towards the end, she says that she is afraid to deter people from following a career in medicine, but honestly, she inspired me so much and even motivated me, because I feel the same things.

It follows the author as she battles with her mental health and burn out whilst working as a doctor. I think - especially right now - it‚Äôs important for people to know the truth about the stress of being a doctor, and how many don‚Äôt even make it through medical school. And not because they weren‚Äôt capable - but because their mental health suffered as a result and they just couldn‚Äôt cope.¬†The writing was incredible - so lyrical and you can really feel the voice of the author. It had me hooked from the start and I felt emotional reading it in parts. It¬†felt like I was having an informal chat with them, like they were telling me their story over a cup of coffee in the back garden.¬†I was shocked by the way junior doctors are treated. How the author nearly fainted on shift because she hadn‚Äôt eaten all day and when she told the consultant she needed to eat, they looked at her with disgust. How at a hospital she worked at the beds we‚Äôre removed so doctors couldn‚Äôt take a break, how since 2017 3 doctors died in car accidents because they were so exhausted. You read about these things in the media but to hear from someone who's been through it is different and really makes you think.I recommended this book to anyone - and not just for people who enjoy reading medical memoirs but anyone who wants to understand how hard it is training to be a doctor. I loved this and I‚Äôll remember it for a long time coming!¬†"
35,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624855-tara-russell,5,"Humane, compelling and beautiful. This is one of my top reads of 2019.There are many moments that resonate in the book, many many Kodak instances, as the author describes them, snapshots that stick in your memory. It's hard to read it and not come away with a profound reaction to the experiences of junior doctors and the almost unimaginable rigours of life in the NHS.Also, I don't think I'll ever forget the scene where the author is trapped in a corridor with an aggressive, disturbed patient, and a fellow patient, a little old lady, handles the situation by shouting, ""You leave Dr Jo alone!""Awesome book."
36,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96640374-katedurie50,4,"As other reviews have noted, this is very different from the kind of scabrous, funny but disturbing medical memoir, much in vogue - not better, not worse, just different. Its real strength is in the gently probing questions it asks about the place in medicine for compassion and kindness. This isn't quite as simple as it may appear; the patient just given the devastating news of a terminal diagnosis may not be able to bear the additional burden of too much sympathy. And it helps that Joanna Cannon was and remains a 'wild card', entering medicine relatively late and by an unconventional route. So she sees things a younger colleague might have missed, But while the tone of the book is quite distinct from his, like Adam Kay she recognises the enormous pressures faced by junior doctors, and the human face of suffering seen in so many patients."

I found it a timely reminder that doctors are human beings who make mistakes, can only do their best and who have feelings and faults just like the rest of us. With Covid prevalent in our society it is a timely reminder that everyone in the NHS is worth their weight in gold and we owe them a huge debt. For every thoughtless, superior medic there are thousands who deserve our respect and sympathy.Many thanks to Netgalley/Joanna Cannon/Serpent's Tale for a digital copy of this title.

The unfeigned delight reading such a beautiful, honest account of a junior doctor from the lecture halls to reality on working in the NHS. Resulting in her demise in character, self believe, self worth and values. I have a sense the author is unpretentious. Her perpetual kindness, wanting to connect with patients at a deeper level beyond the barrier which should not be crossed as a doctor. Throughout the book, you will experience the authors perceptible decline in self confidence; owing to the fact the NHS is underfunded, understaffed, over resourced and lack of superior guidence (which is the NHS today). Which she seemed extremely perturbed about. On a pertinent note, I loved how each chapter title was so eloquently thought out. During reading each chapter, I instinctively understood the meaning and significance behind the naming of the chapter. To finalize, the book is brutally honest. On many occasions, it is dark, deep and most of all gives the opportunity to think about life."
41,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12763282-jackie-law,4,"‚Äúmedicine is all about people, and people are made out of stories‚ÄùWhy would anyone wish to become a doctor? It is a question most potential students applying to medical school will be asked. Perhaps they wish to save lives, to make a difference. Perhaps they come from a family of medics and it has always been expected of them. It costs around a quarter of a million pounds to train a doctor in the UK, a significant proportion of which must now be borne by the student, often in the form of debt. The course is one of the most demanding offered by universities. And yet for every place available, four people who expect to achieve the necessary exam results will apply. It is and remains a competitive career choice.Joanna Cannon entered medical school in her thirties. She was accepted by the admissions panel as a wild card. Her motivation throughout the long years of training was to get into psychiatry. Breaking and Mending is the story of her experiences on hospital wards as a student and then Junior Doctor. It is a sobering indictment of how medical professionals ‚Äì the people entrusted with individuals‚Äô myriad and complex health issues ‚Äì are treated by the NHS and certain of its senior employees.‚ÄúStories bind us together, stories unite us, and we tell our stories in the hope that someone out there will listen, and we will be understood.‚ÄùCannon‚Äôs story is told in snapshots that she describes as her Kodak moments. Each chapter details an encounter with a patient or colleague, the memory of which she carries with her. The burden of her emotional responses over time became a weight that she struggled to bear. The long and busy shifts a doctor is required to work took their toll and she found it ever more difficult to be the type of doctor she had worked so hard to become.Written with grace and candour the descriptions and reflections are a balance between compassion, valuable learning and simmering anger. There is much for the reader to contemplate and absorb. Doctors work to ease suffering and delay death under exhausting conditions. Given the lack of care they themselves receive it is little wonder that too many of them face burn out.Yet this is not a polemic. It is a very personal story that cuts to the heart of issues faced by a vital profession dealing daily with human suffering. Doctors must somehow find a way to inure themselves while showing others care and understanding. Their role goes beyond prescribing and administering appropriate clinical treatment. Good doctors learn to listen to the stories they are told by patients and to find the right words in response. They also benefit when colleagues notice and find time to listen to them. Cannon is a skilled storyteller and this is a poignant and thought-provoking medical memoir. It highlights the importance of talking about topics that make many uncomfortable such as death and mental illness. It underscores the stigma doctors face if they admit they are struggling to cope with the conditions under which they are required to work."

44,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59909651-amanda-jones,4,"I found this absorbing and beautifully written. Having been through medical school, including student rotations in psychiatry (loved it also!), 36 hour work days during internship and A&E as a house officer, so much of this was entirely relatable. It took me on a walk down memory lane.I too was much more of your 'cardigan doctor' yet my emotional experience was vastly different. Leaving the stories, even the most memorable and sad ones at the hospital was easy for me. I've held them in my head, rather than my heart. When I think of the grief I bring to my GP sometimes, I know that's the healthy way to do it. I'd hate to think she brings home any of my pain! You have to keep your empathy and your mental health fully alive by letting go all the emotions as you go along, so your cup never overflows with other people's suffering and circumstances - and so there's always room in that cup for what the next day will pour down.Readers who haven't been through training and practice in medicine and nursing will find this book shocking, touching - and relatable too. Those of us still in the practice of medicine or nursing will have the bonus of introspection, whether we relate easily to Jo's experience or quite the opposite, there's much to reflect on. I found her experience therapeutic too. There are things I dared not admit to myself in those early years of newly qualified practice. And reading this helped me to look back at that time with honesty. Many of us were, as newly qualified doctors, in need of maintaining that veneer of bravado, even between ourselves. Sure, we asked for help - but as little as possible, mostly when we were expected to. We soldiered on when that was expected, even when we felt overwhelmed and out of our depth. Most of us were too young to have any wisdom. Many of us had gone straight from A's to med school and had no work experience. Those involved in training student nurses and doctors may find that this is a book they want to recommend to them, a book they might want to discuss between themselves and with compassionate, experienced seniors who care about their future well being and value their mental health.Though if I remember correctly, the students will worry they don't have time to read it. It's a short read and a lightweight book though, so I'd argue that they do, over solitary moments commuting or in the canteen or when waiting for something to happen. There might even be an audio version - which always works well for a book of this type.Thanks for this book Dr. Cannon. Your last few chapters, from Minds to Mending, moved me to tears."
45,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3148475-jennifer,4,"A more thoughtful, kind and considerably less whiny, misogynistic, disingenuous and funny book about the bloody awfulness of being a junior (ie sub consultant) doctor than Adam Kay's big hit. He made a lot of very important points but ultimately, on the basis of his writing, he is not a loss to obstetrics (even discounting the precipitating sequelae to a tragic event). But Joanna Cannon is a loss to psychiatry and this book shows why. Although the book felt a wee bit sewn together it was an absolutely compelling read which I did not put down again until I had read the whole thing.She was no conveyor belt medical student (told she was someone's 'wild card' as a mature student) and seems to have avoided that whole hothouse thing... although I do wonder about the impact of her long commute and total detachment from a sense of being a university student. A lot of thinking time which may not have been helpful. I wondered too about the timing... did she have her university place before her father died, was he dying whilst she sat A levels?Coming to terms with the dissection cadavers at the beginning of her studies was a challenge for her, and brings an example of real care from other medics, not as a one off but an ongoing commitment as against the multiple unkindnesses dished out as life as a new doctor went on (and in my view some questionable ways to 'correct') I was so glad to read of times she'd told people where to get off.She writes how before she was at last able to focus fully on psychiatry she had been told she spent too much time talking to patients. I'd've liked more about those incidents where people said that. Her description of forcible medication definitely hit home for me as a fellow witness, the special awfulness of non-resistance. Many of the stories are told against herself - not in a ""Haha, what I am like?"" fashion but with an element of real shame (and learning) I am not entirely sure I agree with all her points, but maybe they are true for doctors in a way I believe they should not be so for nurses who have a different role (interesting that she seems never to have thought of being a psychiatric nurse, I wonder why not?) But it is all so well written and worth thinking about, especially the harm that can be done with well intentioned words (and deeds) - the unhelpfulness of ""Sorry"" was immediately backed up by a friend who is dealing with bad medical news. There must surely be another whole book in her horrendous personal medical experience, should she be able to bear it."

I learned that returning a life to someone very often has nothing to do with restoring a heartbeat.
Joanna Cannon is a wonderfully empathetic and very caring doctor - to a fault. She found it difficult to maintain a professional relationship with patients, and was exhausted and broken by the relentlessness of working in an NHS hospital.In this memoir, she highlights the disconnect between the bureaucracy and inflexibility of the NHS, and the humanity of doctors as well as patients. Too often we do not consider or treat doctors or healthcare professionals as human beings first: doctors hold the answers, and we rely on them to make us better.While Adam Kay covered some very similar ground in 
This Is Going to Hurt
, Cannon does so in a far less humorous and far more moving way. Her stories are honest and eye-opening; they rise from the darkest points of her training to uplifting moments when she has a real impact on a patient's life.
Sometimes it is better to worry less about what your job might be and more about the tiny decisions we are able to make that will help someone else's journey become a little easier.
At first Cannon struggled with the need for emotional space between a doctor and patient, a space which she now fills with crucial hope:
The most important ingredient with which to mend a damaged life is hope, for the patient and the doctor.
Two chapters resonated with me, those about 'the wrong words' and 'the wrong kind of kindness': the heavy burden that sympathetic, kind words can become when a patient hears them over and over from everyone and anyone (I feel that!), and the effects of well-intentioned but misplaced kindness which make the receiver feel worse rather than better.This is perhaps one of the best medical memoirs I've read (and there seem to have been a lot over the past year or so!). The writing is not bogged down in medical jargon and the chapters are focussed. Cannon had a decade or so of 'regular' life- and work-experience before training as a doctor. Perhaps because of this, she comes across as very down-to-earth and very very human."

I was really delighted to receive a digital copy of this book as I am a great fan of Joanna Cannon‚Äôs fiction,. I believe that some novels in their subject matter, sensitive treatment of themes and understanding of humanity reveal a compassionate and loving author and I was interested in finding out more about Cannon‚Äôs experiences as a Doctor. This year I have read both Adam Kay‚Äôs books about his experiences as a junior doctor and ‚ÄòThe Language of Kindness‚Äô by Christie Watson all of which top the bestseller list as we satisfy our curiosity about the institution that is our NHS. Breaking and Mending is more akin to Watson‚Äôs book ‚Äì reflective, analytical, soul-searching. The mood is more sombre without the laugh out loud humour of Kay‚Äôs works. Like Watson, Cannon reflects on the journey which brought her to become a Doctor ‚Äì she started later in life having left school with very few qualifications ‚Äì and describes her early days at medical school where it took her weeks to be able to look at a dead body. Cannon reveals so much of herself in this honest account ‚Äì mental and physical battles, a terrible car crash and constant self-analysis about her ability to be a ‚Äògood doctor‚Äô, finally concluding that ‚Äòyou can never be the doctor you wanted to become, because the doctor you wanted to become would not be able to survive.‚Äô.. The book paints a bleak picture of the NHS , ‚ÄòTime, money, resources and hope all run dry. The NHS is held together by the goodwill of those who work within it, but even then it will fracture, and you fall into the gaps those fractures create, and you will disappear.‚Äô This is born out in the case of all three authors who left the service. Breaking and Mending is deeply reflective and questioning, selective in the case studies it presents, but the patient accounts included live with you for days. It is a tale of burn out, long hours, unbearable stress but endless, selfless compassion. She tells the story of early days on the wards at night when her registrar disappears off to Amsterdam ‚Äì Cannon is left in charge of life and death overnight, completely unqualified and inexperienced. When she tells the consultant he turns on her. I greatly enjoyed reading, ‚ÄòBreaking and Mending‚Äô- it added another texture to my very inadequate understanding of being a doctor and yet again it left me thinking ‚ÄòWHY?‚Äô Why does it have to be like that‚Ä¶."
48,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4858657-michelle,3,"This is really thoughtful collection of vignettes about Jo's experiences during her career in medicine, which she came to later than many of her peers. I had a similar feeling whilst reading this as I did when reading With the End in Mind: Dying, Death and Wisdom in an Age of Denial, although unfortunately I found that to be a much more superior book. While Mannix's book is a philosophical look at dying that uses the experiences of her patients and how she herself experienced these events to illustrate her well considered points, Breaking & Mending: A Doctor‚Äôs Story of Burnout and Recovery is a personal account of Cannon's experience and is - much as how she describes the aforementioned experience - a great deal messier.It relates her time before, during and after medical school and follows events much deeper into her career. It shows moments of positivity and moments of despair, both for her and for the patients with whom she interacted. After having met her at an event and talked to her very briefly, I could very much hear her voice as I was reading it. She has written this and been very much herself in the execution, it seems. In this way, the end product feels very much of herself, so I am conflicted in my critique of it. She came across as a lovely person and a compassionate doctor who can also write pretty well. There are some beautifully written lines and the account feels realistic, but it also feels incomplete, like the book had to only be a certain length or a certain number of anecdotes could be relayed. I felt like a bit of the heart was missing - ironic, given the front cover. I'm still glad I read this book. Oddly, for someone who spent so much time in hospitals as a child and teen and still has a great amount of interaction with medical professionals, I seem to enjoy immersing myself in medical memoirs from time to time. I'm sure this won't be my last."
49,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38514295-paula,5,"Having read Joanna Cannon's previous novels The Trouble With Goats and Sheep and Three Things About Elsie and really enjoyed them, when I saw Breaking and Mending on #Netgalley I requested it immediately. I'm not a huge nonfiction reader but because I liked Joanna's writing style I jumped at the chance to read this book. It's so much more than a tales of a junior doctor. Breaking and Mending broke my heart, informed me, made me laugh and made me think. This is not an easy read because Joanna Cannon writes with such a searing honesty you are exhausted with her and when she is broken you feel every bit of her brokenness. This is such a soul baring book it deserves to be read with respect and remembered. The NHS is a wonderful institution but years of underfunding have left it understaffed and under resourced but the people who work there for the most part are stalwarts. Staff are told to administer self care as a priority but when a doctor has to produce a death cert to go to an uncle's funeral for 3 hours you can see that words are cheap in a dysfunctional system. Attitudes to mental health issues are changing, slowly but surely but in an underfunded system mental health is a very poor relation. I don't know why but Jo's psychiatry rotation really resonated with me. We judge when we should be offering a helping hand, we turn our backs on those we perceive to be outside our version of normal but what we don't see is that we are all human and we all have an individual story to tell. This book showed me this so clearly. Jo's writing is heartfelt and honest. Also the clarity of the writing and the ability to convey and make the reader understand the emotion in situations is a gift. I would like to thank Joanna Cannon for writing this book and for allowing us the privilege of reading it."

There is no spare word in this book, no word which doesn‚Äôt carry the reader forward on their journey as they join her on a retrospective reflection on her life as a medical student and junior doctor.This is one of the most thought-provoking books I have read in a long time. Dr Cannon lays herself as bare as the cadaver that accompanied her through medical school, exposing her own vulnerability that readers might learn the brutal reality of her chosen profession for someone who is clearly so innately compassionate and empathetic. As a former nurse, I found this to be quite a painful read at times as it triggered memories of the medical students I encountered who didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to complete their studies because they were too caring of their patients but couldn‚Äôt apply that same compassion to themselves ‚Äì how they would have benefitted from the wise words in this slim volume. Although it makes for harrowing reading at times, it is ultimately a compulsive and emphatically positive book and should be compulsory reading for every medical and nursing student ‚Äì or anyone considering those paths. I would also recommend the book to patients (that‚Äôs most of us at some time!) as it takes any apparent glamour out of a doctor‚Äôs job and replaces it with compassionate reality in a very accessible and humane form.‚ÄúI strongly believe in the power of words, to heal and mend,‚Äù Cannon writes, and in this book she does exactly that, transferring her skills from the wards to her words."

I'm currently studying medicine, and it's the first medicine-related book I've ever read, and it was a perfect match.This is a beautiful memoir about Joanna, a doctor who decided to study later in her life, but this never stopped her from following her passion.It deals with her journey from her first lecture, to the time she found her 'family' in psychiatry. She explores how these years shaped her into the doctor she is today and the emotional part of her job. How emotions are often ignored in the medical field because sometimes you can know the rarest of diseases but cannot find a way to cope with the death of a patient.She talks about her first visit to the mortuary, the excitement of looking at people when you know anatomy. Learning how to talk with patients and use the right kindness. How self-doubt made her think she didn't deserve to be there but then finding motivation in patients and the desire to make even the tiniest of difference. And last but not least what inspired her to pursue psychiatry (one of the things I'd love to do as a doctor).It is beautifully written, in fact, I highlighted entire paragraphs that are just so lovely that I want to read them again and again.Towards the end, she says that she is afraid to deter people from following a career in medicine, but honestly, she inspired me so much and even motivated me, because I feel the same things.

Walking the wards of Cannon's memories we witness the extraordinary and the tragic, the shocking and the heartache as Cannon unashamedly reveals stories of her first post-mortem to sitting with a patient in their final moments.Cannon's words ring wise and raw. So beautifully written is Breaking & Mending that even in the darkest moments of Cannon's snapshots, a glimmer of hope and compassion was nearby. I was so moved by the stories of humanity and love and loss which Cannon trusted us with that I found myself, on multiple occasions, paused in a quiet moment of reflection. I am so grateful to all those who work in healthcare and this book undoubtedly shows us why we need to take better care of those who care for us.Since Adam Kay's This Is Going to Hurt, there has been an undeniable mass of medical memoirs. From sobering stories on the frontline of intensive care to the startling notes of a brain surgeon and the remarkable insight into the life of nurses, these books have been devoured by many. Breaking & Mending should be at the very top of your list."
53,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17429330-vicky,3,"Nicely written memoir , which distinguished itself from some other memoirs I‚Äôve read by focusing in on the crushing way health professionals treat each other oftentimes. For me, this would really have benefitted from more attention to how Joanna ended up eventually leaving medicine; was this related to her feelings as described here or not? And does she have any thoughts on what could be done to better support health professionals? How she got from the absolute pits of despair to the better level of functioning she achieved at the end could have been described in more detail too, I thought. The Psychiatry section seemed awfully short given she feels it was her natural home as a doctor. I thought a nice counterpoint to this was Henry Marsh‚Äôs recent second book, ‚ÄòAdmissions‚Äô, reflecting in equally honest fashion on his career as a neurosurgeon. I say this because I think he touches on how the stress and hardening of emotions can cause the more powerful and experienced doctors to ‚Äòbully‚Äô each other in the ways Joanna describes in the book. A sad scene all round and I do hope things are improving (though from my own work as a social worker I suspect it‚Äôs really not). "

It is very rare for me to sit down with one book and pore through it from beginning to end but that is exactly what happened when I picked up Joanna Cannon‚Äôs¬†Breaking and Mending.I spend a lot of time at hospitals due to my Colitis but Joanna Cannon made me feel like I was a junior doctor experiencing the highs and lows of hospital life along with her. I broke down along with the author and I fell for patients and their families. I had a lot of respect for those who work in hospitals before (from porters to surgeons) but after reading this book my levels of respect has grown exponentially.With the NHS in such a precarious state and with the lifeblood of it being sucked out by money hungry politicians then books like Breaking and Mending, books that offer real life experiences inside the hospital walls are more than entertainment.

It was a relatively easy and short read, so it was easy to speed through in fits and starts (as is often my reading pattern), so it is very easy to pick up where you left off. The descriptive language used is simple and easy to get to the grips with, however, what was lacking for me was that I didn't feel I quite got 'under the skin' of the author and really get to know her. I liked the stories that were interspersed throughout, from various people in the medical profession - it was always good to hear their own viewpoint.The part of the book that I enjoyed the most was learning how she felt very 'at home' when she entered psychiatry - I felt that all the pain and angst had been worth it and she had finally found her vocation in life. It was a real 'eureka' moment. I felt like I had arrived at this conclusion all too quickly and it felt like it was premature. All in all a good, average read, but one in which I would have wanted more detail in the build up to her finally finding job satisfaction. Put simply - there wasn't enough 'breaking' as I would have wanted."
56,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62758905-ivory-castle,5,"This book is an eye opener into the emotional impact of the training and reality of life as a doctor. A reality where a lot is learnt on the job and carries the burden of an image promoted by the media. Where the magic and breathless excitement of those wanting to make a difference by helping to save lives can quickly fade. Doctors are born into a world where society expects their doctors to cope and many learn there is a huge gap between theory and practice.My favourite quote from the book was ‚Äòwe read stories to make sense of the world, to better understand our own situations and challenges‚Äô Location 1345.The author left school at 15, returned to study in her thirties and completed her medical training. After a life of experiences which included worry, laughter, despair and some things you don‚Äôt/cant forget she switched to psychology.

58,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59793609-tracey-gemmell,5,"Joanna Cannon turns her journey through medical school to becoming a psychiatrist into a must-read book. She explores so well the fear of failure, the caring for others at the expense of oneself, and the toll it takes to be on the frontlines of healthcare. Having worked in the hospital setting myself as a speech-language pathologist, I understand the stresses of too many patients, too little time and a sense that you are never able to live up to the expectations you set for yourself when you started in the profession. Until reading Breaking and Mending, I could only imagine how those traumas were magnified by the life and death decisions a junior doctor has to make. Now I know how much I owe these dedicated professionals. This book will reassure anyone in the medical setting they are not alone in their struggles. But it's also a message to the patient that those they turn to in their worst moments are humans. They are to be appreciated and cared for in order for the system to work. Recommended reading for those on either end of the stethoscope. "

While the previous book played it mainly for laughs, this was a more harrowing disclosure of life in the under resourced, poorly funded and largely unsupportive culture of the NHS. It was obvious that the deeply sensitive and empathetic author was going to struggle from her first week at medical school when she struggled with the concept of dissecting a cadaver. Maintaining a professional distance between her patients also proved difficult and she crossed that boundary many times causing adverse effects on her mental health. It was the psychiatric rotation which turned around her extreme anxiety and loss of self esteem, when she discovered it was actually acceptable to talk to patients. It is also important to note that Joanna Cannon is also a superb writer Her patients, their suffering and the effects on their loved ones were vividly drawn and it was impossible not to become involved with their stories. I wept buckets."

We‚Äôre all stuck at home, time is no longer a luxury, and I was curious. Who wouldn‚Äôt any to know, especially now, what junior doctors go through? So I tried it. And I‚Äôm glad I did. I would not really describe this as a set of short stories, more as a series of vignettes - a sort of memoir, presumably very loosely based on Cannon‚Äôs experiences at medical school and beyond.

Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships.

This book is different. Yes, there are stories of patients in this memoir, but more than that there is a deep, warm heart. She is telling these tales not because they make a good story (although they absolutely do) but because she herself was shaped by them. She recalls them not only as a doctor, but as a compassionate human being who is indelibly marked by the people she has cared for or been taught by. A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"

However, I found that (from the point of view of someone who's read several medical memoirs) it didn't add a lot to its genre or differentiate itself hugely compared to some others.

Also a theme in the book I finished prior to this one. Another important point she makes in this book is that more life experience gained prior to med school the better doctors you end up with at the end. It seems such an inflexible system.

Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really reflected on.I would say this has so far been the most beautifully written medical memoir I‚Äôve read. Dr Cannon‚Äôs prose is very fluid, touching and almost haunting."

It was heartbreaking and life affirming, and it would be a pleasure to be treated by a doctor with Jo's bedside manner, you could tell from her words that she cared deeply about those patients who she mentioned in her memoir.I think that the overall tone of the book isn't a humorous one like perhaps This is Going to Hurt, but still a must read for fans of the doctor / memoir type reads."
94,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258442-sadiereadsagain,5,"I've read a few memoirs of medical professionals, and often found they focused on recounting stories of interesting, funny or sad patients. This book is different. Yes, there are stories of patients in this memoir, but more than that there is a deep, warm heart. She is telling these tales not because they make a good story (although they absolutely do) but because she herself was shaped by them. She recalls them not only as a doctor, but as a compassionate human being who is indelibly marked by the people she has cared for or been taught by. A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"

I thought it was a very emotional book, and Cannon's feelings about the profession and about the NHS were made clear in an articulate and compelling way. However, I found that (from the point of view of someone who's read several medical memoirs) it didn't add a lot to its genre or differentiate itself hugely compared to some others. I also found the overall tone or impression of the book to be quite depressing even though this probably wasn't what was intended, perhaps because I'm used to these types of books including a bit more humour and lightness than there was in this one."

I warmed to her very human voice in the way I imagine she communicated/treated patients.It is written with a somewhat heavy heart in short punchy chapters.

As always there are nice stories about patients but it is the power of the personal experience that draws you in. How close she came to burning out completely, how doctors working long hours in stressful circumstances with little to no support are often themselves worn out and tired, when we need them to be in top form when they are looking after us or our loved ones."

A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"

I liked that she started medical school in her 30s and was a ""wild card"" pick for her position. As always there are nice stories about patients but it is the power of the personal experience that draws you in. How close she came to burning out completely, how doctors working long hours in stressful circumstances with little to no support are often themselves worn out and tired, when we need them to be in top form when they are looking after us or our loved ones."

Another important point she makes in this book is that more life experience gained prior to med school the better doctors you end up with at the end. It seems such an inflexible system.

We‚Äôre all stuck at home, time is no longer a luxury, and I was curious. Who wouldn‚Äôt any to know, especially now, what junior doctors go through? So I tried it. And I‚Äôm glad I did.

Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really reflected on.I would say this has so far been the most beautifully written medical memoir I‚Äôve read. Dr Cannon‚Äôs prose is very fluid, touching and almost haunting."

It was heartbreaking and life affirming, and it would be a pleasure to be treated by a doctor with Jo's bedside manner, you could tell from her words that she cared deeply about those patients who she mentioned in her memoir.I think that the overall tone of the book isn't a humorous one like perhaps This is Going to Hurt, but still a must read for fans of the doctor / memoir type reads."

175,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76842-rae,4,Cannon's memoir about her time as a junior doctor in the NHS in the United Kingdom is written in a raw and open way. It is rare to read about the medical school and residency (as we call it in the US) experience in anything other than a positive light.

Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really reflected on.I would say this has so far been the most beautifully written medical memoir I‚Äôve read. Dr Cannon‚Äôs prose is very fluid, touching and almost haunting."

This book is different. Yes, there are stories of patients in this memoir, but more than that there is a deep, warm heart. She is telling these tales not because they make a good story (although they absolutely do) but because she herself was shaped by them. She recalls them not only as a doctor, but as a compassionate human being who is indelibly marked by the people she has cared for or been taught by. A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"

I liked that she started medical school in her 30s and was a ""wild card"" pick for her position. As always there are nice stories about patients but it is the power of the personal experience that draws you in. How close she came to burning out completely, how doctors working long hours in stressful circumstances with little to no support are often themselves worn out and tired, when we need them to be in top form when they are looking after us or our loved ones."

The author writes honestly and doesn‚Äôt gloss over any of the emotions she has experienced. Thank you to all the doctors and healthcare workers out there. You do an incredible job.

It is not for the lighthearted, especially for those who are in the cusp of entering the medical profession. Everything will read as a terrifying foreboding omen that confirms every bit of suspicion and insecurity you might have had prior to entering the field characterised by the incessant dealing with life and death day in and day out. Yet it is that which makes the meaning of the work so worthwhile and fulfilling. "

I've read plenty of books by doctors about medicine and have always felt that they were compassionate to their patients but this reaches a whole new depth of concern for patient (and doctor and nurse) physical and mental well-being. It's wonderfully written, and good god does it ever drive home the message that the NHS is in need of some serious tlc"
194,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13598416-katrina,5,This is an excellent book. Very thought provoking. One of the things she talks about is misplaced kindness or thinking you're doing or saying the right thing but you're actually making things harder for the person on the receiving end. Also a theme in the book I finished prior to this one. Another important point she makes in this book is that more life experience gained prior to med school the better doctors you end up with at the end. It seems such an inflexible system.

It's a short read and at times very thought-provoking. However, I do find it odd that Cannon consistently talks about her desire to work in psychiatry, how it motivated her to retrain as a doctor, and how it 'mended' her in many ways, yet she no longer works as a doctor, and this decision to leave the profession is not explored in any way."

220,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4078732-julie,4,"I like a good medical memoir, and Joanna Cannon writes a compelling story. I liked that she started medical school in her 30s and was a ""wild card"" pick for her position. As always there are nice stories about patients but it is the power of the personal experience that draws you in. How close she came to burning out completely, how doctors working long hours in stressful circumstances with little to no support are often themselves worn out and tired, when we need them to be in top form when they are looking after us or our loved ones."
221,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11608915-heidi,4,A breathtakingly beautiful and poignant memoir. I read it in one sitting and felt emotionally depleted but full of respect and compassion when I had finished. It is truly tragic that our doctors have to endure the brutal hours and unending stress they currently face. The author writes honestly and doesn‚Äôt gloss over any of the emotions she has experienced. Thank you to all the doctors and healthcare workers out there. You do an incredible job. A beautiful book giving a scary insight into our NHS. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the ARC.

It is not for the lighthearted, especially for those who are in the cusp of entering the medical profession.

Yet it is that which makes the meaning of the work so worthwhile and fulfilling. "

224,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13598416-katrina,5,This is an excellent book. Very thought provoking. One of the things she talks about is misplaced kindness or thinking you're doing or saying the right thing but you're actually making things harder for the person on the receiving end. Also a theme in the book I finished prior to this one. Another important point she makes in this book is that more life experience gained prior to med school the better doctors you end up with at the end. It seems such an inflexible system.

It's a short read and at times very thought-provoking. However, I do find it odd that Cannon consistently talks about her desire to work in psychiatry, how it motivated her to retrain as a doctor, and how it 'mended' her in many ways, yet she no longer works as a doctor, and this decision to leave the profession is not explored in any way."

As a big fan of medical reads at the moment, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, having just loved Hand With Care and Prison Doctor, however I was disappointed with this one. Its alot shorter than the others so thought it would be a nice quick read, but if I'm honest it was quite boring and a very negative outlook of working for the NHS. When someone like Adam Kay describes how hard it is, he does it in a way that is describing how it is, but Joanna just sounded like she was moaning the whole time. When she summed up at the end that she enjoyed working for the NHS all those years, I was surprised because you didnt get that feeling throughout the book! Overall for me, this isn't a book I would recommend and with so many good medical books out at the moment, i would read the other ones, as you arent missing much here, sorry!"
242,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23519710-dorothy,5,"I found myself nodding along as I was reading this. Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really reflected on.I would say this has so far been the most beautifully written medical memoir I‚Äôve read. Dr Cannon‚Äôs prose is very fluid, touching and almost haunting."

I loved reading about the different stages in Jo's career as a doctor and how she reacted during different situations. It was heartbreaking and life affirming, and it would be a pleasure to be treated by a doctor with Jo's bedside manner, you could tell from her words that she cared deeply about those patients who she mentioned in her memoir.I think that the overall tone of the book isn't a humorous one like perhaps This is Going to Hurt, but still a must read for fans of the doctor / memoir type reads."
244,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258442-sadiereadsagain,5,"I've read a few memoirs of medical professionals, and often found they focused on recounting stories of interesting, funny or sad patients. This book is different. Yes, there are stories of patients in this memoir, but more than that there is a deep, warm heart. She is telling these tales not because they make a good story (although they absolutely do) but because she herself was shaped by them. She recalls them not only as a doctor, but as a compassionate human being who is indelibly marked by the people she has cared for or been taught by. A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"
245,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58876940-imogen,3,"Breaking and Mending is written in simple but effective prose. I thought it was a very emotional book, and Cannon's feelings about the profession and about the NHS were made clear in an articulate and compelling way. However, I found that (from the point of view of someone who's read several medical memoirs) it didn't add a lot to its genre or differentiate itself hugely compared to some others. I also found the overall tone or impression of the book to be quite depressing even though this probably wasn't what was intended, perhaps because I'm used to these types of books including a bit more humour and lightness than there was in this one."

I warmed to her very human voice in the way I imagine she communicated/treated patients.It is written with a somewhat heavy heart in short punchy chapters. I liked the filtered essence of her observations (of herself, the system and patients) but was left feeling rather short changed. Less is so often more, but this was intriguing and well written enough for me to want more. "

Its alot shorter than the others so thought it would be a nice quick read, but if I'm honest it was quite boring and a very negative outlook of working for the NHS. When someone like Adam Kay describes how hard it is, he does it in a way that is describing how it is, but Joanna just sounded like she was moaning the whole time. When she summed up at the end that she enjoyed working for the NHS all those years, I was surprised because you didnt get that feeling throughout the book! Overall for me, this isn't a book I would recommend and with so many good medical books out at the moment, i would read the other ones, as you arent missing much here, sorry!"
272,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23519710-dorothy,5,"I found myself nodding along as I was reading this. Dr Cannon has a lot of very accurate and relatable insights, not just about practicing medicine but also about life in general. There were some really touching moments in this, and some really important lessons too.One of my favourite parts was what Dr Cannon writes about how words have weight. I think she talks about a really powerful thing here, something I hadn‚Äôt really considered but I‚Äôm glad to have read about. Words which may mean nothing to you may just be heavy enough to break someone, or weigh on them for years to come. This of course is important when you practice medicine, but it is also true for personal life and relationships. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really reflected on.I would say this has so far been the most beautifully written medical memoir I‚Äôve read. Dr Cannon‚Äôs prose is very fluid, touching and almost haunting."

I loved reading about the different stages in Jo's career as a doctor and how she reacted during different situations. It was heartbreaking and life affirming, and it would be a pleasure to be treated by a doctor with Jo's bedside manner, you could tell from her words that she cared deeply about those patients who she mentioned in her memoir.I think that the overall tone of the book isn't a humorous one like perhaps This is Going to Hurt, but still a must read for fans of the doctor / memoir type reads."
274,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258442-sadiereadsagain,5,"I've read a few memoirs of medical professionals, and often found they focused on recounting stories of interesting, funny or sad patients. This book is different. Yes, there are stories of patients in this memoir, but more than that there is a deep, warm heart. She is telling these tales not because they make a good story (although they absolutely do) but because she herself was shaped by them. She recalls them not only as a doctor, but as a compassionate human being who is indelibly marked by the people she has cared for or been taught by. A side effect of this was her own mental health, and this book is honest about the pressures faced by junior doctors and the strain under which our NHS is struggling. Having worked in many different clinical settings, I recognised the characters she herself came across - the mentor, the bully, the pedant, the guardian angel - and the impact these can have on someone trying to learn their way through a complex and terrifying profession. Her story of confidence-crisis and burnout really resonated with me. And not because we responded in the same way (reader, I quit), but because of her ability to share her experience and emotions in such a beautiful voice. Although this is set in the world of the hospital, there is nothing stark or sterile about this book. It is soft and rich, raw and open. As a doctor she saw people rather than patients, and with this book we get to see not just a doctor but a person. I loved this.I was gifted a NetGalley of this title from Serpent's Tail / Profile Books in return for a review. All opinions are my own"
275,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58876940-imogen,3,"Breaking and Mending is written in simple but effective prose. I thought it was a very emotional book, and Cannon's feelings about the profession and about the NHS were made clear in an articulate and compelling way. However, I found that (from the point of view of someone who's read several medical memoirs) it didn't add a lot to its genre or differentiate itself hugely compared to some others. I also found the overall tone or impression of the book to be quite depressing even though this probably wasn't what was intended, perhaps because I'm used to these types of books including a bit more humour and lightness than there was in this one."

This digs down into the raw frustrations of work in the NHS which must, more often than commonly evidenced, lead to the burnout she describes. I warmed to her very human voice in the way I imagine she communicated/treated patients.It is written with a somewhat heavy heart in short punchy chapters. I liked the filtered essence of her observations (of herself, the system and patients) but was left feeling rather short changed. Less is so often more, but this was intriguing and well written enough for me to want more. "

Brought an extra copy to give to my brother and his wife who are a psychiatrist and a gp. Thought it might resonate with them. Having a diagnosis of schizophrenia myself it was lovely to see a doctor who do clearly loved her job and the people she worked with. Most struck by the description of sitting in the death of someone, resonated so much with my recent experience of my partner's father. Thank you"
279,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5546054-miriam-drori,5,"I'll never look at a doctor in the same way, again. I've met doctors socially, of course. I even have a few in my family. They've always been real people. But the ones I've met in their professional capacities haven't - not in my eyes. They've been emotionless. Doing their job day in, night out, without compassion. Maybe I'm just lucky that I haven't needed to know that side of them, but now I will remember it exists.Thank you, Joanna Cannon, for showing it to me, and in such a powerful and beautiful way."
280,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4078732-julie,4,"I like a good medical memoir, and Joanna Cannon writes a compelling story. I liked that she started medical school in her 30s and was a ""wild card"" pick for her position. As always there are nice stories about patients but it is the power of the personal experience that draws you in. How close she came to burning out completely, how doctors working long hours in stressful circumstances with little to no support are often themselves worn out and tired, when we need them to be in top form when they are looking after us or our loved ones."
281,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11608915-heidi,4,A breathtakingly beautiful and poignant memoir. I read it in one sitting and felt emotionally depleted but full of respect and compassion when I had finished. It is truly tragic that our doctors have to endure the brutal hours and unending stress they currently face. The author writes honestly and doesn‚Äôt gloss over any of the emotions she has experienced. Thank you to all the doctors and healthcare workers out there. You do an incredible job. A beautiful book giving a scary insight into our NHS. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the ARC.
282,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134468-tisasday,5,"For a book so slight, small and under 160 pages, it packs a great punch. It is not for the lighthearted, especially for those who are in the cusp of entering the medical profession. Everything will read as a terrifying foreboding omen that confirms every bit of suspicion and insecurity you might have had prior to entering the field characterised by the incessant dealing with life and death day in and day out. Yet it is that which makes the meaning of the work so worthwhile and fulfilling. "
283,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108238237-rix,3,"This book was uniquely rough for me, not that I didn't like it but to get through it I had to deal with some Big Feelings. I've read plenty of books by doctors about medicine and have always felt that they were compassionate to their patients but this reaches a whole new depth of concern for patient (and doctor and nurse) physical and mental well-being. It's wonderfully written, and good god does it ever drive home the message that the NHS is in need of some serious tlc"
284,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13598416-katrina,5,This is an excellent book. Very thought provoking. One of the things she talks about is misplaced kindness or thinking you're doing or saying the right thing but you're actually making things harder for the person on the receiving end. Also a theme in the book I finished prior to this one. Another important point she makes in this book is that more life experience gained prior to med school the better doctors you end up with at the end. It seems such an inflexible system.

It's a short read and at times very thought-provoking. However, I do find it odd that Cannon consistently talks about her desire to work in psychiatry, how it motivated her to retrain as a doctor, and how it 'mended' her in many ways, yet she no longer works as a doctor, and this decision to leave the profession is not explored in any way."

The author really illuminates the feelings we carry about death and a search for meaning in life. Throughout the reading of this book, you feel you get to know the inner mind of the author and the person that she is. A wonderful read. It makes you appreciate little things and inspires a desire not only to engage in little acts of kindness towards others but also, to notice the kindness that exists around us."

The author‚Äôs writing is breathtakingly beautiful and I found myself reading certain sentences and paragraphs over and over again. This is a book written with so much passion, love and compassion, that it often moved me to tears.

In my other life I am both author(not as successful as this one!) and psychiatrist so this book spoke directly to me. Cannon writes openly and poignantly about what it is to be a doctor - and to be human. A must read for every medical student and would be medical student.

295,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76842-rae,4,Cannon's memoir about her time as a junior doctor in the NHS in the United Kingdom is written in a raw and open way. It is rare to read about the medical school and residency (as we call it in the US) experience in anything other than a positive light. I appreciated her honesty and ability to describe her experiences in such a compassionate and vulnerable way.

Definitely recommend for any pre-meds, medical students etc"

I have the utmost respect for her decision and determination to follow a medical career in her forties. The book is more a collection of short stories from her career. I would like it to include more stories as I found it to be short. Nevertheless, it kept my interest until the end."

I really enjoy medical memoirs as a genre, and I liked that Cannon's focus was heavily on her own experiences rather than stories. As much as I'm fascinated by medical stories in other memoirs, her approach was a refreshing change. Emotive and interesting, I would recommend it.."
299,1788160576,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8737509-nicola,3,"How I wish this was a unique story but it is far from it and likely to worsen following Coronavirus. Insightful but lacking in any detail or indication of how mending can be effected. Sadly I feel nothing in the NHS is likely to change as a result of this one, or many other, stories of broken doctors in whom we invest thousands of pounds but treat like they can be discarded. A sad read."
