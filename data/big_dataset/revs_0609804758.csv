0,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,3,"I enjoy these collections of Natural Science magazine essays by Stephen Jay Gould, but this is not his best one. Of the five I've read so far -- there are 10 altogether -- this is my least favorite. At his best SJG's essays play off a number of seemingly unrelated topics and then slowly, often dazzlingly, he weaves the disparate threads together. He still does that here. And the best essays, ""The Diet of Worms and the Defenestration of Prague"" and ""Non-Overlapping Magisteria"" are right up there with his very best. But too often the essays are flat and lacking in the discursive fun that is his hallmark. I intend to read the other five books. But if you're going to read only one let me recommend either Dinosaur in a Haystack or Bully for Brontosaurus. Gould's Wonderful Life, about the Burgess Shale, is brilliant, too, but it's a stand-alone title and not part of the essay series. See my review for each of these."
1,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I read this book before I did reviews. But I’ve been working on my PhD and part of that is thinking about how the images we are presented with of the world shape the way we see that world. And the best example I can think of about that is the third essay in this collection, Seeing Eye to Eye, Through a Glass Clearly . You see, there was a fad in the 1850s in England to have an aquarium in your house. A whole series of technologies had come together at the same time – we learnt about the importance of oxygen to going on living, glass making became industrialised and produced glass of consistent strength and clarity, we were able to transport sea water about the place – and all of this stuff was necessary before aquariums could possibly exist. But what no one imagined before we started having aquariums was the change this might make to how we see the world. Prior to having aquariums – where one looks directly at fish in an eye to eye view – fish and sea life was always either shown after it had been dragged up onto the shore or as if looking down on it from above in a pool. It was only with aquariums that our view of the ‘natural’ way to see fish and sea life changed. Now, isn’t that interesting? The perspective we now believe as being completely obvious and completely natural only came into existence relatively recently and was anything but natural or obvious prior to that.The other lovely idea in this is that the top of Mount Everest is sandstone – that is, the top of our tallest mountain was once at the bottom of the ocean. If that doesn’t do strange things to your mind, you really aren’t trying."
2,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Start by listing Gould's virtues: passionate about paleontology and paleontologists, contagiously curious about nature and obscure history, scrupulously fair to the religious and the pre-modern, animated by justice. For an academic, his prose is highly flavoursome and fun. He has a considered opinion about Darwin's handwriting and the meaning of baseball. One of his essay collections was very important to me as a teen, showing me that I could unify truth-seeking and justice-seeking, and with style. But this is all countermanded, because he is just not trustworthy on human topics, and neither on core evolutionary theory, I'm told. From his enormously influential, fallacious dismissal of intelligence research in general and Morton in particular, to his dishonest coup of public discourse over punctuated equilibrium (pushing the flashy and revolutionary version in literary magazines, retreating to minimal and uncontentious forms in the science journals who could actually evaluate it), he muddied the waters even as he brandished real literary talent and noble political intentions. This is unforgiveable: empirical clarity is too rare and precious to sacrifice so. Maynard Smith: 
Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.
Krugman:
Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there.
Tooby and Cosmides:
We suggest that the best way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct a fictional ""Gould"" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a world of ""evolutionary biology"" every bit as imaginary and plausible as Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional ""Gould"" to have heroic fantasy adventures in... ""Gould"" the protagonist is a much loved character who reveals himself to be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents, a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity, and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and fields, is sadly none of these things.Yet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because readers see in ""Gould"" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations of the scientific impulse. It is this ""Gould"" that we will continue to honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern evolutionary science can offer into wider use. 
Here is a fictional leaf from Gould's ad hominem book, to give you a sense of what he does, at his worst:
Gould is famed for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which holds that adaption and speciation is not generally a slow, gradual process measurable in tens of thousands of year periods, but instead a rapid response to environmental shocks, measurable in hundred-year periods. The political bias of this theory is too blatant to ignore: as a Marxist, Gould requires that sustainable change be possible by revolution rather than by long accumulation (...)
(For full effect I should now chide him for his genic panadaptationism.)Along with Lewontin and Rose, Gould mediated a huge contradiction in our culture: they allowed the C20th left to feel we were scientific, in our comfortable blank-slatism. That we had already incorporated the deep challenge of evolutionary biology - since these eminent men told us it had no human implications. Read Gould for fun and uplift, but take great care, for he cares about other things more than truth. (Read Midgley and Singer first if the politics scare you; they might stop you fleeing into Gould's dodgy arms.)From James. The Leonardo and Columbus esays are 4/5."

4,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"I have Zizek to thank for introducing me to Stephen Jay Gould, who I first started reading ~2 years ago, I think. I sometimes wish I had discovered Stephen Jay Gould earlier. Coming to terms with Darwin’s work was a slow and somewhat tortuous one, beginning at the end of high school, extending all the way until second-year college. My first proddings came from close friends (to this day) who were observants of the Islamic faith. I am endlessly in debt to them, because they were the ones who opened me up to life’s large philosophical questions, to issues of social justice, history, and so forth. They challenged me to more carefully rethink my orientation to evolutionary science, and cited very good academic resources for me to consider, which I of course never took up at the time — preferring to keep to my own evangelical Christian apologetics websites and similar types of sources trusted within my family’s faith community. The pastor of my church used to mock the notion of evolution, citing reputable evidence in the form of handy slogans like “from goo to you”, to prove how ridiculous such an unfounded “theory” truly was. I even chose creationism as my topic in Grade 9 or 10 for a 3 minute speech we had to write and recite from memory to an audience of parents — that is how committed I was to this cause.I think the first time I had seriously questioned my historical understanding of the earth was after watching Herzog’s “Cave of Forgotten Dreams” which I had borrowed from the library. It featured the Chauvet Cave in France (mentioned in this book by Gould, in a very interesting essay about unknown (unfossilized) humps on the backs of now extinct giant deer — or Irish Elk as their commonly mis-referred to as — that are now known about only through cave paintings). I think what struck me was that Herzog, didn’t seem to have an axe to grind, he just referenced the “32,000 year old” time frame very nonchalantly, with great mystery and wonder and excitement, but not didactically.When I reached college I encountered the notion there existed Christians who identified as Old Earth Creationists — an idea that I think I was rather dismissive of, but it lodged itself in the back of my mind as a possibility. At this point, I was of the opinion that I wasn’t really sure what I thought, and that evolution was possible, but I was highly skeptical of it and never took what even professors said at face-value, though it was not like I was fact checking them or anything because I did not understand how academic literature and peer-reviewing worked at the time nor the empirical nature of science. I thought validity rested mostly on sound rhetorical reasoning.In a first year geology course, I found myself thinking throughout the semester, “these chronological numbers are just speculations, theories that are impossible to prove.” By the end of the semester though, I found the old earth narrative very compelling. So many separate fields of science seemed to be unintentionally corroborating each other, and I think that was the point at which I became completely open to the possibility of an earth beyond 10,000 years in age (lol), and I think a young and old earth were equally possible to me at that point. This sounds so ridiculous as I recount it now, but I also try not to kick myself over it in embarrassment because I’m trying to embrace my past also, and understand my personhood as a process in time that is beautiful in some way or something like that, haha.But it would take a persons of faith to convince me fully. The following summer, I read C.S. Lewis’ “Mere Christianity”, a book recommended to my congregation by the very same pastor who looked disdainfully on evolution. I think one of the things I found most surprising was how flippantly C.S. Lewis spoke of evolution, as if it wasn’t a big deal at all. He made space for people who didn’t believe in it and people who did, in his umbrella of “mere Christianity”, though it was pretty evident that he was convinced of the science. I was puzzled but also a little amused how so many evangelicals could love C.S. Lewis and continually recommend his books, but feel so much animosity towards the theory of evolution and not feel like his books threatened their religious doctrines of creationism. But I felt myself more and more sliding into acceptance of an earth that did not match a literal interpretation of Genesis, and aware of the many scientific fields, which seemed to have all separately arrived at the same conclusion regarding the age of the earth and the human species and so on.It was a relatively minor Brian McLaren book called “Finding Our Way Again: The Return of Ancient Practices,” that I think convinced me more conclusively. It was likely because I thought McLaren to be an earnest person of faith, so committed to Christ, yet very insistent that evolution and an old earth were not really up for debate by Christian creationists, because the debate was a scientific one, and the appropriate scientists had for quite a while already arrived at a consensus. I think what helped me the most was his example of Galileo and how the Church had already been wrong about science before — many times — but in each error’s wake they adjusted their theology and it didn’t necessarily make their faith any less meaningful, nor was it necessarily the ruin of their religion (though that may be debatable).This was also around the time I was into Brett McCracken’s blog “Still Searching” (I now strongly disagree with his conservative social interpretations of Christianity) and he had posted a video of N.T. Wright promoting the compatibility of Christian faith with scientific natural history, and emphasizing not only that you could believe in evolution and still be a Christian, but we had a responsibility to take science seriously as a way of taking God’s creation seriously.Years later, having traversed the theological spectrum, here I am, reading Stephen Jay Gould, thinking maybe he could have saved me all this trouble, but also skeptical it could have ever worked out that way. But for any Christian who grew up in a fundamentalist faith community, but no longer wants to leave their intellect at the door when professing their faith, I think Gould’s essay, “Non-overlapping Magisteria”, is a must-read in this book (and it’s freely available to read on the internet here: http://www.stephenjaygould.org/librar... )A useful excerpt from the essay:“I am often asked whether I ever encounter creationism as a live issue among my Harvard undergraduate students. I reply that only once, in nearly thirty years of teaching, did I experience such an incident. A very sincere and serious freshman student came to my office hours with the following question that had clearly been troubling him deeply: ""I am a devout Christian and have never had any reason to doubt evolution, an idea that seems both exciting and particularly well documented. But my roommate, a proselytizing Evangelical, has been insisting with enormous vigor that I cannot be both a real Christian and an evolutionist. So tell me, can a person believe both in God and evolution?"" Again, I gulped hard, did my intellectual duty, and reassured him that evolution was both true and entirely compatible with Christian belief—a position I hold sincerely, but still an odd situation for a Jewish agnostic.”Gould takes religion and theology very seriously. I have never encountered a scientist who could so poetically weave so many bible verses throughout his scientific contemplations. It is incredibly beautiful. How else could I have ever learned that Robert Boyle wrote so much theology:“Of all the scientists in Newton’s orbit, Boyle was the most conventionally and sincerely devout. Moreover, Boyle did not consider religion as a merely private matter. He wrote as much about theology as about science, and he composed several treatises on the potentially harmonious relationship between these two disciplines, including the work analyzed in this essay.”What Gould’s essay “Non-overlapping Magisteria” emphasizes is a jurisdictional boundary between scientific and religious epistemologies:“...magister means “teacher” in Latin. We may, I think, adopt this word and concept to express the central point of this essay and the principled resolution of supposed “conflict” or “warfare” between science and religion. No such conflict should exist because each subject has a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority—and these magisteria do not overlap (the principle that I would like to designate as NOMA, or “non-overlapping magisteria”). The net of science covers the empirical realm: what is the universe made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry,”Kierkegaard emphasized a similar distinction between reason and faith. He emphasized that despite all the accumulated knowledge of humanity (i.e. science), one could not read from this body of knowledge how to live out and experience certain aspects of one life. Kierkegaard’s existentialism emphasized how the domain of experience, passions, spirituality, and so forth lay outside the domain of this accumulated knowledge.One of my favourite novelists who frequently worked with Kierkegaardian themes was Walker Percy, who used notions of horizontality and verticality to articulate a similar orientation to his life “searching” (in his novel, “The Moviegoer”):“If you walk in the front door of the laboratory, you undertake the vertical search. You have a specimen, a cubic centimeter of water or a frog or a pinch of salt or a star.”“One learns general things?”“And there is excitement to the search.”“Why?” she asks.“Because as you get deeper into the search, you unify. You understand more and more specimens by fewer and fewer formulae. There is the excitement. Of course you are always after the big one, the new key, the secret leverage point, and that is the best of it.”“And it doesn’t matter where you are or who you are.”“No.”“And the danger is of becoming no one nowhere.”“But now I have undertaken a different kind of search, a horizontal search. As a consequence, what takes place in my room is less important. What is important is what I shall find when I leave my room and wander in the neighborhood. Before, I wandered as a diversion. Now I wander seriously and sit and read as a diversion.”Science can tell us the earth is ~4.5 billion years old. But science cannot describe the way many communities of people — living in various parts of the world, embedded in oral traditions and narratives, and continuing particular webs of interlocution — FEEL how old the earth is as, together, they move upon its mountains, trace lines along its shores, traverse its open plains, stare up at its forest canopies. When fundamentalist scientists rudely intrude upon the lifeworld of quiet rural towns throughout the Americas, or poor villages of post-colonial Africa, insisting that their creationist views are backwards, regressive, and these people must be converted to the zeniths of Enlightenment Rationalism, are we not returning to the domain of colonialism itself? Is it the task of these scientists to evangelize the masses regarding the age of the earth, or are there not more important things to educate people on? Or for that matter, more important things we have to learn from them? I heard a very wise confession from a Jewish rabbi at my school, who was also a retired professor of science and philosophy. He said, of course he believes the earth is ~4.5 billion years old, but that 6000 year timeline within the biblical narrative is important to him as well. The belief that the earth is 6000 years old still means something to him — possibly a window into more ancient iterations of his community, past (and even present for some people) ways of seeing the wonderful world around them, of imagining their past and fostering the narrative currents, which brought them to where they were, and would carry their descendants along temporal paths to where we are today."
5,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3061131-jim,3,"Gould is the liberal artist's scientist, with his lovely broad education and interests in the arts, literature, and baseball leavens his mission to be a translator for science. I see him as sort of the ur-american public intellectual of the late last century, with a style that is primarily Victorian with punctuation of Marx (Groucho), or Keillor sprinkled with Click and Clack. His love of Darwin and arguments against and for (and during!) the early establishment of evolution has a strange side-effect in these self indulgent essays, in that his writing style is verbose in a way that Victorian gentlemen would appreciate, as well as older WGBH subscribers. As a result the first half of this book was a chore, searching for ideas of interest amidst his overwrought and self satisfied style. Nonetheless, the NOMA and Boyle articles were fascinating to me and talks about intellectual history in an exhilarating way, and the essay on the Taino was first rate, so it's a decidedly mixed bag. I would also occasionally accept his overwrought nature in that he does seem to have an excited curiosity which can be infectious. Favorite/Overused word: ""fatuous"""

For a natural science writer, it is unique to find so many references to Gilbert & Sullivan and baseball. Yet, it is his ability to unite the themes of the Mikado with advances in biology that make him a credit to his field. In every essay there is a sharp wit and awe of nature that is contagious. Who else would spend 12 pages documenting the inversion of natural phenomenon? Through stories of sponges eating fish, and flies eating frogs, or of the complex development of parasites, Gould pokes at our preconceptions and exposes a more nuanced view of nature. Combined with his wide ranging interests outside of science, his knowledge of history and his facility with languages, he is able to produce a unique synthesis of deep and popular science. Some essays were better than others, but 4 stars overall."

The compilation of essays is about 20 years old, as some of the essays allude to events which are decades old, and yet there are some sections which are prescient to the times we find ourselves living in today. Many times I had to read paragraphs 2 or 3 times, simply because Mr. Gould packs so much into a sentence, and also I've probably turned into a lazy reader what with social media and all. I feel like my brain got a much needed work out and I enjoyed delving into a subject I wouldn't normally stop to think about, i.e., Natural History. I will endeavor to put books of that genre onto my reading list! "

You will also find his NOMA proposal in this set of essays, an idea still be debated today."

14,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2224950-kathryn,5,"I started reading Natural History magazine several years ago, because I loved the essays of Stephen Jay Gould that appeared in each monthly issue; each essay had something to do with evolution (with Charles Darwin’s name invoked regularly), and were quite entertaining reading, along with being educational. Alas, Gould died in 2002; but his Natural History magazine essays have been collected in several books, of which this present book is the eighth or ninth (I lost count, and the book does not say). And, for those reading this on my weblog who do not wish to read further, I very much enjoyed the book.As noted, each essay deals with evolution (Gould was for it, by the way). Aside from that focus, the essays cast a wide net, from Leonardo da Vinci to Percival Lowell, from sloths to vultures, from Lewis Carroll to Pope John Paul II, and from Christopher Columbus to the Defenestration of Prague. Gould had a wicked sense of humor, and a genius for writing essays that were entertaining.In the course of the present book, one learns that if Christopher Columbus had thought to put one of the shells on the beach in his pocket when he touched land on October 12, 1492 that one could determine without a doubt which island in the Bahamas he actually landed on (as the shells are quite specific to each island), that Percival Lowell decided that intelligent beings had canals on Mars because he thought he saw plant life through his microscope (he reasoned that plant life meant animals, that animals must mean sentient beings, that these sentient beings had to be on a higher scale than us, and that the beings had constructed a canal system to get the water from the Mars ice caps to the plant life), and that the Pope’s announcement some years back that evolution was a licit belief for the faithful was news because a previous Pope had said that evolution was licit, but that it was one hypothesis among many (and God willing, the scientists would find another, better, theory).Gould was at some pains to point out that the current conceptions of evolution as held by the popular mind were in many ways incorrect; mankind is not the natural culmination of evolution, and evolution does not mean an inevitable progress from dumb to smarter. He also enjoyed, in these essays, showing how the by-ways of scientific enquiry can shed light on issues, even if the by-ways led to apparent dead ends.I have read all of the previous collections of Natural History magazine essays, and I am very happy that this one will go on the shelf next to all of the other collections."
15,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037969-jen,5,"This is not a book I'd normally pick up on my own, since I don't really think of myself as a science lover. However, I've been working my way through our bookshelves, reading the books that I haven't read that look interesting. I've reached my husband's science section, and I have to say that I love Stephen Jay Gould. My husband has been a big fan ever since we met, and I see why. His essays (this book is a collection of essays Gould wrote for Natural History magazine)are fascinating, such as when he wonders what the world looks like from a sloth's point of view. He writes clearly so that a non-scientist can understand his subjects, but he doesn't talk down to his audience. He must have been one of the most well-read, well-rounded people on the planet. He can talk intelligently about 19th century scientists, baseball, philosophy, Broadway musicals and history. He has an amazing vocabulary and makes me feel smart when I read his book. He's an avocate of consulting primary sources when you want to understand something, and he presents things in a very balanced, thoughtful way, rather than trying to sensationalize or politicize. Also, someday I hope to use the word ""complexify"" in casual conversation. I was only going to read one of my husband's Stephen Jay Gould books as a sampling, then move on, but I'm definately going to read more!"

I knew little about the topics covered in this book, except for some sketchy background about Darwin, Da Vinci and defenestration(!) Gould brings his erudition and wide knowledge of more than just science to bear on each topic, expounding and expanding in equal measure, building up new perspectives in places and revealing forgotten or unknown details in others.

Years ago, I thought the basics of science were quite cut and dried - already figured out centuries ago. Then, as I studied geology, I found what a young science it was, with basics such as superposition and fossils figured out only about two hundred years ago. I heard about conflicting theories and how some of the major tenets, such as continental drift and plate tectonics were ridiculed until the late 1900s. Of course, we expect new developments in medicine and astronomy,but even physics and categorizations of early hominids is being reevaluated. It does make one wonder what we consider today to be scientific fact will be debunked in the future. Science is evolutionary. Pun intended. "

Now what's wrong with people today who still believe in such mythological nonsense. I saw Stephen Jay Gould speak a few weeks before he died, and he knew he was dying. He never told the audience. After the lecture, I wondered why he didn't tell more jokes because I love his sense of humor. Perhaps that is why. Instead he used the time to speak up for the diversity of life and its importance. He's a truly great man, and I miss his stories. He would have written so many more. "

As an English/Social Studies teacher, most of the essays in this book discussed elements of science that were a little too scientific for my taste. Definitely not for the layman, although it had its moments. Otherwise, it was very intelligent and well written, just not for me."
23,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/298791-nicole-marble,5,"Stephen Jay Gould was one of the widest ranging intellects of the 20th cent. His sentances are often complex and his range of thought can be dizzying, but he is always amusing and fascinating. I enjoy learning about the wilder corners of science, and Gould is the best teacher!"
24,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/410277-matthew,4,"A wonderful collection of some of Gould's columns - covering issues from an evolutionary biology point of view. Gould's rational thought and ability to illustrate with examples from the real world enrich our understanding of the world and more importantly, ourselves..."
25,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"Typical high quality of Goulds writing. This is a series of essays on a range of subjects that have piqued his curiosity. While this could be of somewhat greater interest to non-scientists than much of his work, it is primarily for scientists with interest in paleontology and evolution. "
26,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5842150-benedict-reid,5,"He's so, so good. History and it's impact on modern thinking... as with all his collections of essays. The one flaw is that it's a bit too long. I'd read a lot more of him if his collections were novel sized rather than war and piece."
27,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38502415-richard,3,"Put this on history shelf because it is Natural History. I don't read much science; in fact, Gould is the only writer on science I go to at all with any repetition. His writing is excellent and his sense of humor doesn't diminish his scholarship. "
28,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24496340-peter-murray,5,Gould is both paleontologist and philosopher. His essays on Natural History are a must read for all biologists in my opinion. The real arguments within the vast domain of yet-to-be-formed evolutionary theory are ongoing and fascinating.
29,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29265436-ella-catherall,4,"I found the individual essays really interesting and they were of the right length so that they didn't get dull. They were quite heavy but not horribly so, just made it difficult for bed time reading. However, that's the only real criticism I have. "
30,0609804758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1284248-jenje,3,"Super interesting and informative, but too often the writing style flat is flat and meandering.
