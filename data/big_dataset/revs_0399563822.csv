Jay, no dry science in the house.Access to space, asteroid mining, fusion power, programmable matter, robotics, AR, synthetic biology, bioprinting, and brain-computer interfaces are some of the stars of a close future. I like this fresh, not so techy, agenda and bias-free look at technologies, as books with this kind of overview and prognostic character often tend to have elements of subliminal messaging towards pro humanities, transhumanism, pro-tech, pro philosophy,… that let the focus escalate in just one direction, ignoring many key elements that wouldn´t fit to the wished reasoning. Yes, it are often books written by males.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergin..."

Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith's Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything was interesting, compelling and (replete with references to D&D, Star Trek, Star Wars and the robot uprising of 2027) was relatable in a geeky way. Weinersmith looks at how emerging technologies will impact our everyday reality and change our perception of our place in the universe. Fusion energy, the exploration and colonization of the solar system, programmable matter, augmented reality, brain-computer interfaces, precision medicine and origami robots are all covered. Some of what the Weinersmiths wrote about was surprising, but regardless of how implausible any given prediction might be, experts who are working out these innovations were interviewed and the status of their work assessed. Easy to follow and read! 3.75 stars."

Getting your prediction right is a bit harder, but honestly, does anyone really care? (c)Q:There was a study in 2011 called “Are Talking Heads Blowing Hot Air,”* in which the predictive abilities of twenty-six pundits were assessed. Predictive powers ranged from mostly right to usually wrong.*For most people, the pleasure of reading this study was the discovery that certain individuals were not just intolerable morons, but statistically intolerable morons. From our perspective as pop science writers, there was an even more exciting result: Regardless of their predictive prowess, all these people still have jobs. In fact, a lot of the worst predictors were the most prominent public figures. (c)Q:The big discontinuous leaps, like the laser and the computer, often depend on unrelated developments in different fields. (c)Q:Consider this: If someone came to you two hundred years ago and asked how we might build a device to scan people’s brain patterns, would your immediate response be, “Well, first we need to trap some gas in a glass tube”? (c)Q:The same difficulty holds for all the technologies in this book: Whether we can build an elevator to space may depend on how good chemists get at arranging carbon atoms into little straws. Whether we can make matter that assumes any shape we tell it to may depend on how well we understand termite behavior. Whether we can build medical nanobots may depend on how well we understand origami. Or maybe none of that stuff will end up mattering in the end. There is nothing about history that necessarily had to be as it was. (c)Q:We now know that the ancient Greeks could create complex gear systems, but never constructed an advanced clock. The ancient Alexandrians had a rudimentary steam engine but never designed a train. The ancient Egyptians invented the folding stool four thousand years ago, but never built an IKEA. (c)Q:There are also people who become cynical because they thought we’d have fusion power or weekend trips to Venus by now. (c)Q:For all these chapters, we had to read a lot of technical books and papers and we had to talk to a lot of mildly crazy people. Some were crazier than others, and generally they were our favorites. (c)Q:The road to Mars may be paved with small discounts. (c)"
3,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,4,"This book delves into technological realms that the authors feel could see gigantic leaps in our access to and use of in the future.  This novel was written by husband and wife pair, the former, a cartoonist and the latter, a noted Rice University Researcher.  They interviewed many scientists across various fields of study to learn about up and coming technologies.  They start each segment by explaining where we are with a certain technology, then discuss where research is heading, what the future could  be like, potential advantages, concerns and pitfalls.    Interspersed within this writing are many nerdy scientific jokes and cartoons to help lighten the reading.  The humor is the kind you would expect from scientists, not the laugh out loud kind.  That said, I did appreciate the diversion.The ten areas explored in the book are: 1. Cheap Access to Space, 2. Asteroid Mining, 3. Fusion Power, 4. Programmable Matter, 5. Robotic Construction, 6. Augmented Reality, 7. Synthetic Biology, 8. Precision Medicine, 9. Bioprinting and 10. Brain-Computer Interfaces.  There were some chapters, especially the medical ones, where I found I knew much of the content, but still the future applications were quite interesting.  Other chapters were completely new to me and I was grateful to this book for enlightening me.  Depending on your background, you may find the presentation of information simplistic or you may find it mind blowing.  For the average lay person without a scientific background, this book is a wonderful introduction to emerging technologies and what we might expect in the future.  I also found myself envisioning ideas for futuristic science fiction novels while reading this.  There is much food for thought here.I like that the authors are bringing much of what is currently exciting about science and technology to greater attention in a very readable format.  I recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning more about the topics mentioned above.  I am also grateful to the Book Riot 2017 Read Harder Challenge for pushing me to read harder and choose a book in this category.  I'm glad I did!"

Now you quickly realise that Bob is super intelligent, and you start having the most interesting conversations. The problem is Bob spits when he talks. Its highly annoying (and unhygienic) and you end up cutting the chat short.Reading this book was something like that. The content is highly interesting, but the way it was told was off-putting.If you can ignored the juvenile humour and the cringe worthy cartoons what you are left with is speculative science. Looking at emerging science/technology and how it could be applied in future. Humor is always a tricky thing as not everyone things the same things are funny and there are obviously readers who loved this, but for me it was a huge disappointment."

""You promised me Mars colonies, and all I got was all of human knowledge indexed and available to everyone on Earth for free.""
Remember watching ""Back to the Future"" and thinking we'd have hoverboards and self-tying shoes by now? Does it ever frustrate you that technology doesn't progress FASTER than what it does? Like, ""What the heck are those scientists doing? They can't grow us new bodies yet?? What's the big hold up, this one is falling apart!"". I love to read technology books and they're usually quite optimistic that all these new devices and medical procedures, etc. will be available in ""the very near future"". I am often left wondering, If we already have experimental versions of these technologies, why won't they be available for several more years? The books make it seem so simple, and I wonder why it's not as simple for those scientists creating these technologies.In Soonish..., wife and husband team Kelly and Zach Weinersmith tell us exactly WHY. They discuss 10 emerging technologies, explaining what they are, what we can do with them so far, and why they don't yet do everything they theoretically can/should. Sure, you might think that it's oh-so-easy to build a space lift that will transport you from the ground to the international space station. Well, actually, if that's what you're thinking, you're wrong. You probably should read this book to see why it's not quite as simple as you think it is. The Weinersmiths delve into such areas as brain upgrades, programmable matter, mining on asteroids, bioprinting new organs, and many other interesting topics. Whilst I didn't learn of any technologies I hadn't previously known about, this book was still informative and a lot of fun! The authors are incredibly witty and I often found myself laughing. If you like comics, there are several interspersed within the chapters (normally comics aren't my thing, but they somehow made this book even better). If you like technology, and you like to learn, and you like to laugh whilst you're learning, this is the book for you!"
6,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"Ok, so here's the thing. I really LOVE science. Granted, I'm not the greatest at maths, but I love biology as well as chemistry and at least am really into what physics means. *lol*Which might be the reason why I also love non-fiction books as much as any others ... if they are done right. Moreover, I've been a fan of comics and the age-old ""what if"" question. Ergo, a book combining that sounded great. Problem was, it didn't work 100%.I had never heard of the authors before but checked out some of Zach Weinersmith's comics after starting to read this book. I don't mind his simplistic way of drawing but quite a number of panels just failed to make me laugh. And unfortunately I had the same problem when reading this book.It is clear that the authors have done their research and that Kelly Weinersmith especially knows her science and is very passionate about it. Consequently, the book has some interesting - albeit sometimes already outdated - information on all kinds of inventions from space elevators and reusable rockets to 3D organ printing and deep-space exploration.I really like how they structured the book to give the reader a little bit of background to understand each topic (incl. some interesting history lessons), then explain where we are currently, before delving into what could be (incl. potential problems).Sadly, despite the slight humour, the comics and despite me not even minding that some of the science was outdated already (technology especially is such a fast-evolving field that it's impossible not to fall behind when writing a book), the book wasn't as good as I had hoped. Still, it is well written and one of those books that could enthuse some readers enough so that they check up on the topics mentioned here and if that is the case, it's done its job. For me, personally, it was a light refresher course on some things and an appetizer on others."

So, it's funny. You were probably expecting that.So, it's got comics. You were probably expecting that.What you might not have been expecting was one of the most thoroughly researched, best explained, unbiased looks at the future of technology and how it will change our world and ourselves.

Not only does it give the reader ideas for what might be coming along in the future and what that might mean for mankind (good or bad) but it is done in a very humorous way! It sure got a few chuckles and giggles out of me! That's the best way to read science! Make it fun! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

There were some amazing ideas explored in the book (such as a elevator to an asteroid to make space exploration cheaper, meteor mining and advances in medicine) , but there were some crazy ones that seemed a little to farfetched (such as mirror humans), but overall this is a very solid book that presents very heavy information in a simplistic format.

10,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926719-patrick,2,"I was bamboozled.I read a fantastic book called “Filmish” which uses a comic-book format to discuss the history of cinema.When I saw a book called “Soonish”, which promised “a hilariously illustrated investigation into future technologies”, I imagined a science-focused “Filmish”.This was not that book.The illustrations were sparse and amateurish, the humor falls flat in most places, and although the science is accurate enough, the writing is juvenile and condescending at times.This book would be a lot shorter (and better) without the poor illustrations and lame attempt at humor."
11,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9579465-virginia,5,"This is a really fun collection of ten technologies currently in R&D. The Weinersmiths combine fact and humor to create a book that's so informative and silly you'll want to read it again and again. Zach Weinersmith is the creator of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, a popular geek webcomic great for fans of XKCD. His wife, Dr. Kelly Weinersmith, is an accomplished scientist whose work has been featured through many popular science venues. They worked together to explain complicated technology and science in such a way that those who last took a science class in high school can understand what they're talking about. Their combined wit and self-deprecating humor make the writing exciting while Zach's cartoons help break up all the heavy concepts with a good laugh. Personally, I find that if I'm laughing while learning, the concepts stick with me better. For anyone who enjoys books like WHAT IF? and science podcasts, this will be an excellent book to add to your shelf. This is a great informative book about what technologies are being researched and which ones might come out soonish.***I read this book thanks to an ARC I received***"

Insightful thinking and research about popular science with comics and humor throughout. It delivers on that very well, providing an excellent summary of the frontiers of technology towards the end of the second decade of this century. Clearly it will date quickly, but it puts some excellent real-world context around a lot of the technologies that I've been reading about in near future SF."
13,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21122595-tim,3,"This book is looking at our world and tries to make predictions where science and technology will lead us. The book is split into sections: ‘the universe’, ‘stuff’, and ‘you’ containing a range of topics such as asteroid mining, augmented reality, brain-computer interfaces, and space elevators. As well as diving into the science, Soonish explores some of the economic and ethical implications around these technologiesThe skills of a scientist are paired with those of a cartoonist which means this book stays light and fluffy. Maybe too much so, in my opinion. Often science books can become dry and stuffy, yes, but I would have liked a little bit more focus and less flat humor on this one. Not bad, but I had hoped for more.Thanks to netgalley and Penguin Press for providing me with a free ebook copy."

It was well worth keeping it at the top of my “wanna read desperately” books.This husband and wife team have put together an amazing thing here. Each chapter really reads like a short story. All you’ve heard, all you have thought of, for future realities can be found here along with the obligatory “robot” .

20,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3668071-lisa-kucharski,4,"Enjoyed the book and the humor involved. It's nice to see what different people are seeing as the ""on the horizon"" tech. It's written with humor but also explains the reality of where things are and how far they are from happening be it, costly to well... we haven't worked out all the bugs yet... hmmm.The book covers 10 ""areas"". 1. Space Traveling. 2. Asteroid Mining 3. Fusion Power. 4. Programmable Matter (my fave) 5. Robotic Construction. 6. Augmented Reality 7. Synthetic Biology (yikes). 8. Precision Medicine (still tricky). 9. Bioprinting (like as in to print a liver) 10 Brain Computer Interface (fork in the brain)Then it ends with chapters that didn't make it.If you have a nerd friend and are wondering what to get them this would be a good book, though you should also check to see they don't have it already. I'm reading an advanced copy so I didn't get to see the color cartoons which are throughout the book as well.The best thing about the book is the examination of where we are and why things are slowly progressing... that analysis of what it takes to make something happen... the shining idea and the crash of reality. However the way people are approaching the reality to make things happen are very interesting. If you need a good dose of humor with your science probably a good book for you. I just like humor everywhere so it works for me."
21,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy,3,"So, finally getting round to this... not really.... my NetGalley version only consists of the introduction and the first two chapters: How to get into space cheaply and asteroid mining. Once I realized that, I mostly skimmed and just perused a bit here and there.Entertaining, amusing style, that borders on slightly silly. Amusing, very simple comic strips—I recommend reading the ebook version on something that allows colour. Easy to understand explanations of complex topics. Space elevators, reusable rockets, Elon Musk and the odd Star Trek joke make an appearance.It‘s ok, if you are looking for something light to flick through, when you have a few minutes to spare. Coffee table reading, mostly decorative.I received this free e-copy from the publisher/author via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review, thank you! "
22,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,3,"For me, too much humor not enough content. I think I like more in depth types of science books rather than survey types and as always, humor is subjective and it just wasn't my type.With those negatives out front, Weinersmith really does a good job of giving you/us the current state of a wide variety of science. Just enough information to be coherent discussing them at parties and in my case enough information that I became curious and went to find more.A good, well thought out book that just didn't hit my sweet spot. I would recommend it to anyone. If you can find a way to read one chapter before buying it, you can tell from that if you will like the rest of the book."

A much better starting place is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space...It would be a vertical cable almost long enough to wrap completely around the Earth, under such enormous tension that we'll have to wait until far-stronger, lighter materials are developed. There'd be an asteroid-sized counterweight at the top. It would spin with the Earth, eastward--cutting across the north-south orbits of all the satellites in low-Earth orbit. What could go wrong?"
24,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21361049-sazedul-waheed-nitol,4,Very interesting read. The authors tried to speculate about future technological & engineering scenarios of different sectors and the challenges we might face in those sectors. Authors discussed these issues in details and tried to maintain a light tone. But I think that readers who don't have a strong background in science would find it difficult to finish the book as there's a lot of science jargon in every other page.

27,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"This was a fun and interesting read. Soonish is about “ten emerging technologies that’ll improve and/or ruin everything”. Dr. Kelly Weinersmith does the heavy lifting with the science writing while her husband, Zach, adds the mostly humorous, sometimes scientific cartoons found throughout the book. I’ve read my share of future science books which present the “oh, wow” and “shiny-happy” version of the future, and I think what sets this one apart is the way the Weinersmiths present not only the “wow” part but also the “oh crap” part of the technologies which may shape our future, and give a realistic timeline (if there actually is one) of when these technologies could become a factor. Some already are on our doorstep and have begun to knock. All the chapters are really well researched and contain interviews with experts. The book features a bibliography and an index if you want to go back and revisit your favorite subject. The conclusion contains a Graveyard of Lost Chapters which consists of a short examination of four future technologies that didn’t make it in to the book and were “put down” but the authors. Any science geek will enjoy this book. The topics covered are as follows:The Universe, Soonish: Cheap Access to Space, Asteroid MiningStuff, Soonish: Fusion Power, Programmable Matter, Robotic Construction, Augmented Reality, Synthetic BiologyYou, Soonish: Precision Medicine, Bioprinting, Brain-Computer InterfacesWhat I liked most about the book was the simple explanations of the technologies, some of which are a bit hard to get one’s head around. Especially good was the chapter about CRISPR-Cas9. Gene editing is one of the most important technologies invented in many and has the potential to change lives. I’ve read a bit about this over the last year or so and the explanation in this book one of the easiest to understand I’ve run across.And the a very cool bonus: if you have the Soonish app on your phone and point it at the book cover or even an image on your computer it shows an augmented reality space elevator, complete with the ship moving up the wire to the station in orbit! I would highly recommend Soonish to anyone with an interest in science. It is a rate combination of humor and science, and I found it to be more accessible than a lot of books of its ilk."
28,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834122-vegantrav,4,"Soonish is a rarity among popular science books on the technology of the future: it addresses but moves beyond the scientific aspects of the technology and asks and largely answers questions of feasibility and economics. Sadly, the answer for many of the fields that the authors address is that the technology is still so primitive that it is not feasible in the near future and may not be feasible for even many decades hence or even ever, and even for the technology that is feasible, the costs are often so outrageous that, barring major changes to national and international economies, it is unlikely that the technologies will ever be fully developed because the cost is so prohibitive.The book is very grounded in reality, and so the general tone about the development of the future technologies examined is on the pessimistic side, but the book is still very informative and is seasoned with just the right amount of humor and a conversational tone to keep it from being overly technical. It's written by authors who are themselves non-experts in the fields that they are discussing, so the material is readily accessible to anyone who is reasonably scientifically literate."
29,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,3,"Well, this is a good book for people who know very little about latest technologies and developing scientific fields, but it may fall a little short for those who know more. It's still a good overview of most promising technologies and I'd recommend it, but somehow I expected a little more. I understand science had to be brought to a very simple level, but a little trust in readers wouldn't go amiss. The humour, though, didn't just fall flat but completely missed the point too many times to count. It was also a bit too immature for my taste and sometimes painfully shoved in when no humour was needed. (But kudos for trying to make science books more fun.)I did enjoy the space exploration chapter, which is my favourite of the book, but that doesn't outwigh the troubles this book slowly compiled. I was also disappointed in the cartoons that often didn't contribute to the science but tried to interject some more humour. Why not let pictures speak for themselves, illustrate the technologies, rather than the authors arguing with each other?"
30,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3396466-greg,2,"I'll quote the authors here: ""Honestly, if you just want a thumbnail overview on any of the topics in this book, Wikipedia is a decent place to go."" [pg. 319] If, on the other hand, you want your overview corrupted with dubious humor befitting a snarky Buzzfeed listicle, this is the book for you. The first few chapters held my interest well enough, despite the rising dread I felt whenever more than two sentences had elapsed since the last lame joke and it became apparent that the next one would be imminently inbound. However, once I got to the chapter on building construction, a field in which I have more experience than the authors seem to, I knew I could no longer trust their ""expertise"" and I began to question all of their assumptions. Presumably, there is good scientific content in this book, but you'll have to wade through oceans of ""humor"" to find it. Three hundred-plus pages of this is just too much. "
31,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12816722-jitesh-sharma,4,"The best thing about the book for me was the small and precise selection of emerging technologies. I've read some books talking about many over the top innovations without going into details of any one. This book does the exact opposite, it has selected 10 most promising ventures and discussed every prospect about their emergence and their hurdles. As a civil engineer, it's hiked my interest in space elevators as they are not that far in future as I thought earlier. This book will help you understand the reasons, why some technologies aren't their which should've been around by now, in a simple and practical way. You will get to know the pioneers all around the world who are working hard and taking bold steps to remove ""fiction"" from science-fiction. I hope to see many of the mentioned emerging technologies come true before the Big Robot Uprising in 2027.P. S. - I didn't know we were that close with Brain-Computer Interface.

I expect that the sort of person who already reads Weinersmith's webcomic (SMBC) is also the sort of person that will find this book to have little that s/he has not encountered and contemplated already, whether technologies or their implications.As one would expect in a work from Weinersmith, this book is smattered with humour, or rather, attempts at humour which never quite land successfully. For me, they introduced cringeworthy moments every couple of pages.I like Weinersmith's webcomic, and I believe the couple is uncommonly smart and contemplative. Only, this book was something of a grating experience for me, I'm afraid."
33,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,3,"Not bad at all. Fun, informative and doesn't take itself to seriously. I learned a lot. In fact, based on how I've rated books in the past, this should be a five-star book. Why isn't it? I listened to the audiobook which was mostly read by one of the authors. This was a shame. She wasn't a bad reader, not really, but I've gotten used to listening to pros. She was no pro. I've run into my share of books that had worse readers who weren't the author (A mystery, that) but this book really needed something more. Xe Sands, for example, would have been perfect. She read The Beekeeper's Lament by Hannah Nordhaus and absolutely killed it. Could have used some of that for this book. The right reader with the right audiobook makes magic. Pass it on."

It’s no small feat predicting how upcoming technological advancements will play out -- both accidental discoveries and the complex dynamics of interacting fields of research can really throw a wrench in timelines (we were promised self-tying shoes and hoverboards damnit!), but the Wienersmiths do a fantastic job of presenting what’s out there, where it’s likely headed, and what we can expect to see Soonish."
35,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2848292-jack-heath,5,"This is the perfect book for people who find most pop science either too gloomy or too optimistic. The authors have gone to enormous trouble to explain emerging technologies in a cautiously hopeful way, with plenty of little-known details and some gleefully childish jokes along the way.Even if you already think you know what a space elevator is, or who Dr Gerald Bull was, or what augmented reality can do, or how 3D printers might revolutionise housing, I strongly advise you to read it. You might just be around to see the future SOONISH predicts. I'm awaiting it with equal parts excitement and dread!"
36,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This was pretty good. The Weinersmiths have a knack for explaining technology in terms that can easily be understood by the layman, making Soonish a very readable book. I noticed several other reviewers here have praised this book for being funny. I would say that it’s written in a light and humorous tone, but it’s not really “funny” because the individual jokes never quite land. But that’s okay. It’s interesting.I listened to this in audiobook form. The authors read it themselves. You can tell they aren’t professionals, but they still do a fine job."

I liked the talk of space guns sending goods to the space station, and the comics interspersed throughout the narrative were a fun cute way to get the point across. Interesting to think that the thing that is stopping more space travel is the cost when we spend billions each year on warfare and other not so pleasant things."
38,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,I had problems with the layout and illustrations but that may have to do with the way I approach books. fairly good on the science with one misstep. i think she underestimates the prospects for quantum computing which might be on the verge of taking off as I write. Anyway not a book for me but that doesn't mean it is a bad book.

A must read for the curious geek. Total Rating: 9.4/10 Originality: 9/10Language: 10/10Atmosphere: 9/10Education: 10/10Illustrations: 9/10Fun: 9/10Creativity: 10/10Believable: 10/10Relevancy: 10/10Cover: 8/10Genre: Non-fictionTime It Took Me To Read: approx. 1 hour“We predict that computers will get faster. We predict screens will get higher resolution. We predict gene sequencing will get cheaper. We predict the sky will remain blue, puppies will remain cute, pie remain tasty, cows will continue mooing and decorative hand towels will continue to make sense only to your mom.” THE BOOK:I cannot remember the lat time I have enjoyed a non-fiction book SO much. This book with funny comic illustrations truly spoke to me. The authors present you with numerous future technological inventions, and back each one up with data, research and theory. Absolutely loved it. Originality: 9/10The premise is great, just has one major problem,which the authors are very aware off: Technology evolves so fast that the content is quickly out-dated. Therefore this would actually be a great series with monthly issues or something. For someone like me, who really WANTS to understand science, space and physics, but lacks the background or ability to comprehend some of those complex thinking, I would totally buy a monthly version of this nonetheless. Language: 10/10What do you expect - this has been written by researchers. They know their words. But even more fascinating it was written in a way even science noobs understand, using real live examples:""By comparison, on a roller coaster, you may feel as much as five times more acceleration. With training, humans can endure about ten or twenty times the elevator without passing out. Much beyond that and you might die. Why? Well, when you accelerate in a car, notice how the water in a cup rushes back and stays back until you stop accelerating. Imagine the cup is your body. Oh, and instead of 0 to 60 in 10 seconds, you're going from 0 to 17,000.""Also, the authors are plainly hilarious. I laughed about this for about 5 minutes:""For most people, the pleasure of reading this study was the discovery that certain individuals were not just intolerable morons, but statistically intolerable morons.""Atmosphere: 9/10It is odd to speak about atmosphere in a non-fiction book, but I really really felt amazing reading this. I felt intelligent (because I understood what they were talking about), and I felt drawn in so much I read the whole book in a sitting. I did not want it to stop. Every minute I interrupted my poor husband who just wanted to play his video game and telling him ""Wow, did you know...."" Education: 10/10As mentioned earlier with language, this book is very educational. I learned so much, more than I learned in my whole time in school in physics, honestly! This book gives you so much material to research further, and so much material to seem really intelligent at small talk. It even answered many of my questions I had about space travel, like why we haven't been back to the moon yet, or why we haven't build mars colonies yet. Illustrations: 9/10The comic strips scattered in the book added another element of humour in the book. They are often just one picture, and I honestly found them funny, which is impressive considering I am not a fan of most comic strips. I almost wished there would be more of those actually. Fun: 9/10So. Much. Fun. To achieve this as a non-fiction book is in my experience incredible. Plus, it did not feel like ideas were stretched out or unnecessarily repeated like I find in many non-fiction books just to fill the pages.Creativity: 10/10Most suggestions are based on research - but Kelly and Zach go one step further and ask more questions, developing a first idea into lots of different strings and looking at it from lots of angles. Talking about asteroid farming for example, they keep thinking further: What would that mean for our industry? Could we sell those harvested metals? Who would own the materials? What are the dangers this would bring? Collapse of our economy? Could people create disastrous sabotages? Believable: 10/10I believed it all. Kelly and Zach use lots of research, interviews with experts and data to back up their theories. Relevancy: 10/10Knowledge is power. And technology now is changing so fast, and if you are like me and napped too much during physics, you have no idea what most of those words scientists use actually mean. But this book made me feel much cleverer, informed, prepared for the future, and curious. Cover: 8/10The cover made me think it was more comic-driven than text-driven, which was not a bit misleading. I still liked it a lot though. Total Verdict: 9.4/10I would totally buy this as a monthly subscription magazine. Not only did I learn, I laughed, wondered and was fascinated. Lots of material to impress your geeky date, or shine at office parties. Read the full review here: http://bit.ly/2yj7LZX"

43,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"If you enjoy SMBC, then you will enjoy this book. The authors do a good job of injecting their humor into well-done explanations of possible future technologies. They do a very fair job of evaluating what a possible future technology will do, its benefits and possible downsides, and they get a good spread of experts. The topics covered range from energy to biology to space travel.I didn't notice any major errors in any of the areas I was familiar with and so would give pretty high confidence in all that they said. The one minor error that I noticed was in the fusion section. I happen to work in magnetically confined fusion. They said that to heat plasmas ""They electrocute it, microwave it, and fire a beam of neutrons at it"". We most assuredly do not fire a beam of neutrons at it, but we fire a beam of neutrals (that is a particle with no net charge, or non-plasma). This technology is quite interesting on its own (look up netural beam injection on wikipedia). This is a common misinterpretation (""neutron"" for ""neutral"" since they sound similar), though.Otherwise, I definitely recommend the book, but I like the style of humor. If you don't like SMBC, then you probably won't like the style of the book."
44,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49355780-cady-johnson,2,"Pros:- I learned about some concepts I didn’t know existed before- it was somewhat easy to read. Something about the format however made it hard for me to explain to others or remember what I just read. They used a lot of oversimplified metaphors to explain things which sometimes only confused me and then I felt dum that I didn’t even get the metaphor.Cons:- Sometimes the humor worked and sometimes it didn’t for me. -It got really annoying clicking into the footnotes when 50% of the time it was a joke I didn’t get-The cartoons were neat but I didn’t get the jokes in them or the purpose of them the majority of the time. Since the subject matter was complex it was also hard for me to context switch to get the joke.- I wish there was more subject matter discussed outside the realm of space and health. Like underground tunnels, flying cars, what’s next in popular devices, that sort of thing.- I didn’t understand the point of the “graveyard” section. Like, if it wasn’t good enough to put in the book in the first place, why have it at all? It seemed like the writers were trying to prevent people from giving “but what about this?” feedback when ultimately you can’t prevent that from happening when you are writing this type of book."

Or give the authors a way to access cheap space travel so they can collect all the stars from there.(Look, it me trying to be relatable by referencing a chapter from the book).1) Which book gives you not only well-written chapters with understandable analogies for you to wrap around it, but also chapters which didn't make the mark and mourn for them?2) Which book mixes up cannibalism, telepathy, technology, and other t-words all in the same book?3) Which book has 9 pages of references?4) Which book is the one to change your life?The answer (because this is in a review) is Soonish.I picked up this book after my friend recommended it to me because we both are nerds.I took about 2 months exactly to read it , but I am so happy I took the time to pore through these pages because this is such a good book.I found so many references to other books/academics through this one, and I know I shall go through all of those as well, although I'm not sure if I'll get the same ""my world has changed"" viewpoint as I did with this book.ALL THE STARS."

Well researched and current, but with far too much added humor and web-style comics.These are bigger-picture ideas, not simple components like driverless cars or retinal scanning. Each has a thumbnail sketch of where we are now, possibilities and concerns, and how this tech could change the world. In the conclusion, the authors express their biggest fear is being called inaccurate, and this book seems to pass that test.There is a final chapter which lists ideas they thought of including but didn't. In that section they described their process - write up the idea, then inject humor and cartoons. This latter injection was the major drawback for me. Cartoons that explain a topic or its drawback would be fine, but the vast majority of comics in this book do not. Many contain just the authors and a joke or humorous situation - these feel very forced.I get that one of the two authors is a successful web comic guy, and some humor in a science book is welcome - but this book goes beyond over-the-top."

This is well and truly written for that publisher-beloved ""general audience"". Lots of science books are marketed as such, but this is one I would actually recommend to just about anyone. Kids might have a little trouble with some concepts, but anyone who had even an eight-grade science class even a long time ago will be able to follow the authors' explanations. It's a look at an array of different emerging technologies and how they might affect our futures (or more likely the futures of our great-grandchildren). The humor and playful tone keeps this from becoming too serious, while the challenges and ethical concerns of innovations are dealt with a nuanced thoughtfulness. Personally, the space chapters are my favorites, but the chapter on printable organs was very cool too. In the end, I just want more, not soon, but NOW. "
48,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"There are some great ingredients here:- from the authors of the genuinely excellent SMBC comic strip- the book samples from a buffet of different science topics in an accessible way- the authors went out of their way to find interesting or funny anecdotes from major figures in each fieldI was really anticipating (and rooting for) a great book here, but if I'm honest it was merely pretty good. It felt long after a while and I found myself looking ahead to picking another book in my list to read. The chapter format was a little repetitive, maybe there were too many topics, and although I love the authors' sense of humor it got a little stale by the end of the book. Sometimes I had a hard time separating what was scientifically plausible from what just made for witty commentary. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for either."
49,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3147465-ray,2,"Started this with some enthusiasm which sadly wained. Subject area exciting and should have me entranced. Perhaps I'm being very unkind, in that it felt to me like an enlarged Wikipedia article, a collection of fact after fact with humor to leaven the fact... that it was boring. The humor felt forced something inserted to an editorial plan rather than flowing from and with the text. But I did learn so it served a purpose. It was a helicopter view so that's the level I learned at, a sense of landscape with little detail as if each technology was represented by one or two ""selfies"". This is probably fine if you know little about the directions of modern science but if you read a science magazine like New Scientist now and then and particularly its excellent collections series, or listen to the many podcasts available, there really is little here for you"
50,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31138442-brad,5,"This was recommended and lent to me by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a fantastic read the makes the science and technology topics accessible to everyone. It walks you through some of the logic on the technology, the problems/challenges that have to be addressed in working toward it, and the implications the given tech would/will have, both good and bad. You can sense the great deal of research that went into studying for this but it still is something easy to consume. The humor was great and I received several quizzical looks from fellow commuters on the train when I couldn't contain my laughter. The humor may not be for you, however, some people didn't seem to enjoy it quite as much as I did, but I wonder if that is just because I was sharing snippets out of full context."
51,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17011474-gregory,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this silly romp through emerging tech. The science isn't too heavy, the humor is my style, and the authors aren't hype-machines (a common issue with future tech). The authors were right to trim each chapter and section to keep the pace moving (though it does slow down a little near the end).My biggest gripe is that the comics are mostly single-panel. That's fine, but the true strength of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal (the web-comic by the same authors) is the long-form. I think they missed a huge opportunity to create exceptional long-form comics that could be both funny and poignant."
52,0399563822,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,4,"This book looks at some existing technologies and makes predictions about how they will develop in the future. The early chapters explained som things that are not neccessarily obvious. Airplane engines have quite different characteristics depending at what speed they work. You can build your own device to fuse atoms (yes nuclear fusion), it will randomly and on a very infrequent basis create helium and emit a neutron.Mostly this books shows how hard some problems will be to solve (if at all)."

The authors go through various in-development technologies from cheap space travel to automated construction to personalized medicine. They do a good job of describing the current state of the technology, the future outlook/feasibility, how it could improve the world, and some of the troubles it could cause. The whole book also includes a level of humor I found entertaining. My only complaint is that some of the medical chapters dragged on a little but otherwise the book was very engaging."

Not sure what's up with the formatting-- frequently there is a big chunk of blank space after a paragraph, which the reader might assume is the end of the chapter, but it's because there is a cartoon at the top of the next page, with additional text after that. The illustrations aren't so sensitive that they make sense one or two paragraphs out of context."

Even as someone who reads a fair amount of this subject, I found some new subjects to enjoy, and I appreciated the authors giving a fair amount of space to technical limitations and concerns. Having said that, your enjoyment would probably be related to how much you follow new tech developments. Someone who follows more than I do might not find much new, while someone who doesn't touch pop science might find this a fantastic introduction."

The authors provide an overview of state of the art in every field, outline some difficulties that will need to be overcome, and make some potential prognoses.
