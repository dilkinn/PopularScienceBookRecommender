Don’t want to spend your valuable time to understand the complexity of the world of physics? Do you think physics cannot be easy or physics cant be funny?? Come here! Come here!One afternoon of a bank holiday Mr. Tompkins goes to attend a lecture on Theory of Relativity and falls asleep when the lecture goes over his head. But only then he enters a dream world where everything is happening like the lecturer was saying. Surprisingly, now the phenomena are easy to understand cause those are actually happening in front of his eyes. An everyday character trying to comprehend difficult concepts of science in weirdly simple yet delicious dreams, walk in parks and what not! Seriously, here is a book for all of us written by one of the finest physicist himself! Read it to laugh, read it to learn! You will never regret reading this! Please?!"
1,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,4,"George Gamow (during his ""three decade vacation"" in the USA) wrote a number of articles and books featuring Mr. Tompkins, a bank clerk with an especially easily influenced dream-life. The dreams have a funny way of becoming stories and adventures that explain features of fundamental physics and cosmology (as of the 1960s). Many of the illustrations are also by Gamow. A foreword to this edition by Roger Penrose indicates where theory has moved on since Gamow's time and the few, slight inaccuracies in the description of Relativity.Mr. Tompkins' adventures are charming - delightful, in fact, though they show signs of the time/culture they were written in. The appearances by Father Paulini (Pauli) and Maxwell's Demon (dressed as a Butler but never without his tennis-racquet) are particular fun for me. No-one would consider writing a popular science book via this approach these days and so this will remain a unique classic of the genre. Strongly recommended to everyone just for the fun of it. You might learn something along the way but nevermind if you don't - just wait for the bit where Tompkins turns into an electron!"

3,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665098-mark,5,"This book is a classic popularization of science by one of the great popular science writers who was also a brilliant physicist. He did a lot of work in developing the big bang theory. This book combines two earlier books. The first is ""Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland"" which discusses the weird consequences of relativity on time, mass, and velocity through alternating scenes of a science lecture and the dreams of a bank clerk who dozes off during the lecture. The same structure is used in the second book, ""Mr. Thomkins Explores the Atom"", which describes quantum mechanics including atomic and nuclear structure.Gamow writes in a clear and humorous style that both enlightens and entertains. His writing reminds one of the way Richard Feynman could break down the most complicated concepts into easily digestible nuggets. (Considering the chronology, perhaps Feynman reminds one of Gamow.) He imagines what the world would be like if the speed of light was much smaller and is obtainable by a bicyclist. In the second book, he imagines what would happen if Planck's constant were much larger. (It has to do with the uncertainty principle.) General readers will like this book, and learn a lot of science. Readers who know the science will love it and increase their understanding. "
4,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327206-charlotte,4,"Mr. Tompkins, a childlike fellow who works at a bank and has limited intellectual ambition, has various fantastical experiences (usually dreamed up while sleeping through lectures delivered by his father-in-law, a physics professor) which illustrate the laws of physics in extremely intuitive ways. The book is geared to young readers or an audience with casual interest in the subject, but I must say I learned more than I'd like to admit. This is a thoroughly charming little book with a pleasantly dated, mid-century feel. From the standpoint of the history of science, it is interesting to read an account of the ""latest"" developments--as of 1965--in quantum physics and relativity from the point of view of a contemporary and one of the big names in the field. "
5,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40590836-ami-iida,5,This book is a commentary book on the theory of relativity.It explain it so much fun.
6,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8391461-jessica,1,"I finished reading this story for no other reason than completing a recommendation from a friend who has been requesting I read some of his favorite books. I have a very limited knowledge and passion for physics, but my friend insisted that I would still find enjoyment in the basic storyline that ran through the overarching plot. I found none. Even had I possessed a prior interest in physics, the story itself was painfully boring and seemed to arbitrarily exist for the sake of tying the chapters together. Essentially, reading this book felt like listening to the ranting and rambling lectures of a monotone physics professor. "
7,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/780526-marcus,4,"Without this book I would still be utterly lost trying to understand modern (circa 1950s) theoretical physics. While I'm still far from fluent in understanding all the nuances of relativity, this book provides a guided tour through it's perplexing concepts. Want to better understand Einstein? This is the book for you."
8,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743620-jennifer,5,"This is the coolest introduction to Physics out there, I actually read and reviewed it for my final project in my Physics class at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics way back in 1997. I still have a really fond place in my heart for this well-written introduction to complex concepts. LOVE IT!"
9,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555413-vishy,4,"Finally got to read Gamov's book on physics featuring Mr.Tompkins :) Gives a beautiful account of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics in everyday language. It had one of the best, most accessible explanations of radioactivity that I have ever read. Longer review soon. "
10,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037117-eric,5,"If you want to read up on quantum theory, this is the best place to start!"
11,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60800887-david,4,Mr.Tompkins is not your average book. It is a collection of short stories all based around the same character learning about science. The stories are usually entirely disconnected from each other and usually turn out to just be dreams. If you like to learn about math and science I highly recommend this as the book tries to explain it in a way that lets you think about similarities to the macro world we live in compared to the micro world he usually explores. The book talks about everything from how the speed of light works to subatomic particles qualities to things as big as the end and start of the universe. So no matter what level your at if you are interested in science this would be a great interesting and informational read.
12,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"Physics has never come naturally to me. I thought this book would help me understand more since it is supposedly written for children. Every once in a while, I understood something, but most of the time it went into the eyes and immediately rose up like steam through my brain without sticking anywhere. Oh well. I suppose if I repeatedly attempt to understand, eventually I'll get it. Fortunately, I own this book and can easily read it again if I can bear it. The fact that it's somewhat outdated will lessen that possibility. I do like what I understood."
13,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63131027-jens,3,"I read translated versions of these books as a boy, and they were part of the reason that I pursued an education and work life focused on natural sciences and technology. So even if theoretical physics may have evolved somewhat since the midlle of the 20th century, I thought it would be interesting to revisit Gamow's little gems. I found the stories to still be charming, but maybe three decades passed had cast a too romantic light, raising my expectations to an unrealistic level. three-and-a-half stars."
14,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6022684-scott,3,"Mr. Tompkins has a bad habit of falling asleep during his friend the Physics professor’s lectures and having wild dreams set in the strange worlds of quantum physics and atomic particles. The book is a blend of these fanciful adventures with straightforward discussions of science. Last revised in the mid 60s so it might not be totally up to date, but it’s mainly of interest for Gamow’s sometimes humorous way in popularizing fairly difficult topics."
15,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27751101-jose-brox,4,Great as a popularizing physics book.
16,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"While drinking with a select group of academics and fellow graduate students a raucous and far-ranging discussion led to an ernest suggestion to read George Gamow’s Mr Tompkins stories. The discussion had meandered into a messy philosophical argument bringing into question our understanding quantum physics, as discussions often did in the cloistered world of university physics departments. Well actually they usually devolved to discussions on sex and quantum physics; two subjects we physicists found equally mysterious.Fortunately George Gamow had thought about quantum physics enough to make it intelligible to most, including physicists. His stories explain to the layman the basic ideas of quantum physics and relativity by exaggerating the actually existing phenomena to such an extent that they can be easily observed by the hero of his stories, C. G. H. Tompkins, a little clerk of a big city bank.George Gamow wrote the first story in 1938 and subsequently had it rejected by Harper’s Magazine. Suitably chastened after half a dozen more magazine rejections he put the manuscript in a desk drawer and forgot about it. What follows, in his own words, is a fascinating commentary on science communication: During summer of the same year, i attended the International Conference on Theoretical Physics, organized by the League of nations in Warsaw. I was chatting over a glass of excellent Polish miod with my old friend Sir Charles Darwin, the grandson of Charles (The Origin of Species) Darwin, and the conversation turned to the popularization of science. I told Darwin about the bad luck I had along this line, and he said : ‘Look, Gamow, when you get back to the United States dig up your manuscript and send it to Dr C. P. Snow, who is the editor of a popular scientific magazine Discovery published by the Cambridge University Press.’ So I did just this, and a week later came a telegram from Snow saying: ‘Your article will be published in the next issue. Please send more.’The rest, as they say, is history. In 1940 Cambridge University Press published a book form of the articles called Mr Tompkins in Wonderland. This book was followed by a sequel, Mr Tompkins Explores the Atom, published in 1944. Then in 1965 Cambridge University Press united these two books into this current volume, which updated the stories with current advances in physics, illustrations by Gamow and verses and songs (!) written by Gamow’s wife Barbara. This possible quaintness works well for these stories; giving them an intimate storytelling, an almost (in my mind) Lewis Carroll feel to the stories, while at the same time knowing that the physics is real.The fifteen chapters in this volume truly are a masterclass of science communication; exquisite science, simple and engaging stories, imbued with subtle humor. Some of my favorites are: Quantum Jungles, where Tompkins and ‘his old friend the professor’ go hunting with ‘Sir Richard’ in a region where everything within is subject to quantum laws with a very large quantum constant, resulting in tiger hunting with a difference, and chapter 101/2 (J. K. Rowling I think was influenced by this 1965 piece of writing), A Part of the Previous lecture which Mr Tompkins Slept Through, which introduces quantum chemistry.This was a must read in 1981 when I was first introduced to it. Gamow has lost none of his ability to communicate what even now is an arcane discipline to non-specialists or ‘layman’. Gamow is also, I believe, a great example to any, both aspiring and established, science writers on how to develop and communicate a narrative around complex science subjects.This review was first published here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post...

WIll update this when I recall the name."
19,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25833062-billpalmer,5,"Review of ‘Mr Tomkins in Paperback’ (1994) by George Gamow, Canto Books (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.Reviewer W. P. PalmerThis book should be on any science teacher's bookshelf: it is inexpensive and a delight to read. Firstly, however a little information about the publication.1. This small paperback volume contains not one but two separate books. Mr Tomkins in Wonderland was originally published by Cambridge University Press in 1940. Mr Tomkins Explores the Atom was published by Cambridge University Press in 1944. The two volumes have been through different editions and reprints ever since and in 1994, Cambridge University Press marked more than half a century of Mr Tomkins by bringing out a joint paperback volume of all the Mr Tomkins stories. 2. Mr Tomkins in Wonderland explains Einstein's theory of relativity. Mr Tomkins Explores the Atom explains atomic structure and some of the ideas of quantum mechanics. He does this through the introduction of three main characters, Mr Tomkins, a clerk in a big city bank, with an interest in, but little knowledge of, science and a strong propensity to fall asleep and dream during the ""Professor's"" scientific lectures, the ""Professor"", who gives the scientific explanations, and his daughter Maude, who develops a romantic attachment to Mr Tomkins. 3. Relativity and quantum mechanics are explained very well through these stories and Roger Penrose in the introduction states that with a few minor exceptions these stories still give a useful explanation of these 'difficult to grasp' concepts.4. Gamow wrote the first of the Mr Tomkins stories in 1938 and was unsuccessful in finding a publisher. Eventually he offered it to C. P. Snow, who then edited Discovery and who published it and subsequent Mr Tomkins stories in Discovery.5. The original illustrations were drawn by John Hookham, but after Hookham had retired, Gamow did subsequent drawings himself following Hookham's style. I suggest that the whole new volume would be very suitable for teachers who want a reasonably accessible explanation of relativity or quantum mechanics or for interested students in Years 9-12.Original review in The Journal of the Science Teacher Association of the Northern Territory, Volume 14, pp.134-135.BILL PALMER"
20,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37034446-rob,3,"Gamow took on the challenging task of writing a novel that would involve lofty science topics such as relativity and quantum mechanics, in which he would help the readers develop a basic understanding of the topics. He did a pretty decent job, but I think for a casual fan of science, it is still a laborious read - you really need to take your time and think about the topics and having a beginning background in the ideas is useful. I did like the way that the chapters were their own little stories and reading them together fits in the story line, but you could still read a chapter by itself without worrying about remembering what happened earlier in the story."
21,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"A single-volume reprint of two popular books describing the state of theoretical physics as of the mid-1940s (quantum mechanics is there, but quantum field theory isn't) in the form of dreams of a listener to popular physics lectures. Some of them are obviously inaccurate, but I am stumped trying to come up with something better. For instance, in one dreamworld Planck's constant is macroscopic, so a tiger attacking an elephant looks like many fuzzy tigers. Classical physics has probabilities, which are nonnegative real numbers that add up to 1 (you don't know what direction the tiger is going to attack from, but you know that it has to attack from somewhere); what's different about quantum physics is that it has amplitudes, which are complex numbers the squares of magnitudes of which add up to 1, so the tiger can constructively or destructively interfere with itself. Now, how do you explain it to a reader who may not have heard of complex numbers?"
22,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18221892-linda-hamonou,5,"""Curiosity makes a scientist""This book tells the story of a banker who wants to learn something new and end up in a relativity class. Of course, he get's so bored than he falls asleep and visit a world ruled by relativity.It continues with lectures on physics Mr Tompkins attempt during which he always manage to grab some more sleep and some more dreams about quantum mechanics and atoms.Even if destine for a large public, I can understand why some people might be tempted to take a nap during the lecture. The dreams are a lot easier to understand and give a release for the brain that lack in textbook. Mr Tompkins always end up with very interesting question which his father-in-law never fails to answer. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a easy way into quantum mechanics and atomic physics. Though it might be better to start by reading Alice in Quantumland first."
23,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1622495-m-l,5,"Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland, and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom, are two adorable gems by physicist George Gamow.In story format, Gamow presents important concepts to the general public. The themes are dated -- e.g., Mr. Tompkins attends lectures in order to win the favor of a professor whose daughter he wishes to court; however, the style is nevertheless effective -- and funny.There is a contemporary version, an ""update"" of Gamow's Mr. Tompkins works, which may be more readily accessible to modern students. Even so, I recommend this original version because it is the first of its kind -- a creative, innovative approach by a physicist who was present during the time of these ground-breaking developments in physics. "
24,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6080060-caleb-lohrberg,0,"This book surprised me. Mr. Coakes had lent it to me after a discussion we had on some science theories. At first I thought it was going to be like reading a text book. Although i kept me thoroughly entertained and mentally challenged as it described many current and new ideas in theoretical physics. The whole book is written in 3rd person, and it tells the story of Mr. Tompkins, a sometimes too curious man who find himself trapped in many predicaments. From becoming an electron trapped in a chlorine atom, to the beginning of the universe when it was the size of classroom. Again this book really surprised me, it was very entertaining and extremely fascinating. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about science."
25,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5932356-tim-robinson,3,"Mr Tompkins has a number of dreams in which he encounters advanced physics on a personal level. Thus he is exposed to relativity and quantum mechanics, cycling close to the speed of light and circling a nucleus as an electron.At first glance, this seems like a good way to bring science to the masses. In fact, this kind of writing is never satisfactory. Shrinking the hero to an atomic scale so that he can experience quantum effects first hand may create an illusion of understanding, but the reader can gain only the vaguest idea of what is really going on. Thus, the work is too difficult for the layman and too inaccurate for the specialist, and falls between two stools."
26,0521447712,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1460812-mary,5,"What was this doing on my ""want to read"" shelf? I've read this book many times, starting at the age of about 12, and I absolutely love it! Nowadays, if I work hard at it, I can sometimes make a little sense of the lectures that accompany the stories. But the stories, with their old-fashioned charm, do most of the teaching and entertaining here. I recently shared this book with a teen volunteer who was introducing younger kids to Einstein's theories (in a class on cosmology). A lot of fun, thought-provoking, and educational. The theories are no longer cutting-edge, as they were in the 1950s, but I don't think this book will ever grow old.(And I do want to reread it soon.)"

I love the way George Gamow explains chemistry concepts. Mr Tompkins shrinks ala Alice in Wonderland to quantum/atomic size and exlores on a personal level the wonders of small things. And it is oh sofun and personal too - the electrons dance and everything is not as it seems. Nothing is like things are in the ""real"" world. Science is explained along the way, along with the history of those who discovered various facts. Should be required reading."

Gamow uses Mr. Thompson as a vehicle to describe basic comsmological concepts, chemistry, geometry, and a little statistics as well. He is a good enough writer and although the stories are corny, I still learned something after each chapter. Today, I have probably a 10% chance at describing General Relativity. That's infinitely greater than where I was previous."
