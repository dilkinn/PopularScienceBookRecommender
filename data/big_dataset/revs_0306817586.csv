0,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,4,"I loved this book, and it wasn't just that cheeky Brian Cox going on all the time about being covered in tweed and chalkdust (somebody please hand me a fan).'Why does E=mc2' is my fifth book from the Royal Society science book shortlist. If Marcus Chown is magical cellulite cream, this is physics bootcamp - no corners cut, no let's-take-it-easy-today-shall-we. Cox and Forshaw don't just want to explain this equation - they want you to understand it, to understand its power (predictive and descriptive) and understand how, despite being just a diminutive collection of letters and symbols, it underpins nearly a century of contemporary science, and captures some of the most fundamental characteristics of the universe.I feel like the target market for this book - a person who gave up on maths in fourth form, and stumbled through sixth form physics before escaping the next year to classics class, my natural home. Cox and Forshaw are punctilious in their care for the mathematically challenged, to the point where even I wished they'd quit apologising for bringing the maths in to it - because for once, I was following it.I'll need to read the book at least one more time to really get to grips with the subject. But I started to feel the magic tingle of understanding when I read sentences like 'temperature is essentially nothing more than a measure of the average speed of things', or when I looked up from the book and listened to the waves breaking and thought of them as energy, drawn from the moon's gravitational force, dispersing itself through friction and sound (yep - an unusual beach read, I'll concede, but perhaps that suggests the book's measured pace and gentle writing).I felt my usual moment of cosmic connectedness when I read in here about the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Hida, Japan, where neutrinos are 'seen' passing through a cylinder filled with 50,000 tonnes of pure water at the bottom of a mine shaft. Knowing that every second every part of my body, everthing I can see - everything I can't see - is being lanced through by innumerable particles spat out from the sun fills me with a sense of wonder that is the nearest I come to a religious sensation.In addition to their explication of the equation, Cox and Forshaw do a good job of describing the sense of wonder physicists themselves feel, not just at the deep movements of the world, but at the almost magical way that mathematics can be used to describe them. Writing about the master equation that lies at the heart of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and sums up - well, basically everything - they note:It is certainly impressive that we can shoehorn so much physics into one equation. It speaks volumes for Wigner's ""unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics"". Why should the natural world not be far more complex? Why do we have the right to condense so much physics into one equation like that. Why should we not need to catalog everything in huge databases and encyclopedias? Nobody really knows why nature allows itself to be summarized in this way, and it is certainly true that this apparent underlying elegance and simplicity is one of the reasons why many physicists do what they do. While reminding ourselves that nature may not continue to submit itself to this wonderful simplification, we can at least for the moment marvel at the underlying beauty we have discovered.Highly recommended if you have the itch to scratch, but a word of warning - if you're not interested in understanding why the theory of special relativity is so important, then this is not the book for you. The authors are intentionally avoided adding to the (understandable) hero worship that surrounds Einstein, and this is not biography-as-science: this is a maths and physics primer, kindly and interestingly written. "
1,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Cox and Forshaw pack Einstein’s theories of relativity and much more into 250 pages. They state upfront that their book is intended to be challenging. And it is, despite simplistic analogies and explanations tucked in between some pretty dense material. Their underlying premise is “From the simplest of ideas”. Einstein noticed that Maxwell had shown that the speed of light was a constant and from this he constructed the Special Theory of Relativity. Then Einstein thought about the fact that all objects fell at the same rate as Galileo demonstrated. He turned this idea into the General Theory of Relativity. The first half of the book centers around a derivation of E=MC2. Many complex topics are addressed along the way. The authors employ high school algebra and geometry but their manipulations can be intricate. The derivation is not done historically. They use Pythagoras’s theorem to compute the value of time dilation, the difference in time between a stationary observer and one in motion. They note that the observer in motion and stationary observer are interchangeable. Each can perceive the other as the one moving and the one for who time slows. There is no absolute motion as Galileo validated.Time, size and distance are observer dependent but the solution must be invariant, looking the same to all observers. To achieve this space and time must be combined into a single entity with four dimensions. The authors introduce us to Minkowski space which blends space and time. In spacetime Euclidian geometry won’t work. In it Cox and Forshaw use a modified Pythagorean formula that avoids going back in time which would violate the principle of causality, e.g. you can’t kill your parents before you were born. To measure distance in spacetime, the constant c, is introduced to calibrate. It is the universal speed limit and the speed of light. Everything moves through spacetime at this speed. If at rest the movement is all through time. If moving through space then time slows proportionately from the point of view of a stationary observer. Thus both moving and stationary observers agree on movement through the combined spacetime and invariance is achieved. To complete their derivation the authors introduce momentum, the product of mass and velocity. Momentum is a three dimensional vector in our everyday 3D world and four dimensional in the 4D world with the added component of time. The time component of the momentum vector in 4D space is mc, mass times the universal speed limit. Momentum is a conserved quantity as is mass which is equivalent to energy. Mass and energy are different manifestations of a single underlying physical quantity. Energy, mass and momentum form a spacetime object known as the energy-momentum four-vector. From this the authors produce E=MC2. The details are in the book. The foregoing is just intended to give the flavor and flow of the book.The second half of the book is easier to digest as Cox and Forshaw give a broad overview of assorted physics topics. They describe the vast amount of energy in a tiny amount of mass and how that mass is converted, not just in nuclear reactions but in chemical reactions and other everyday phenomena. They venture into particle physics and quantum mechanics describing the emission and absorption of photons from electrons and subsequent changes in their “orbits”. The authors discuss the Higgs boson as the origin of mass, even though this was just a prediction when they wrote the book. They even go back to the Big Bang and the disparity between matter and anti-matter. They then present the equation for the Standard Model, explaining what each term represents. They discuss how the model was put together and the various contributors, Glashow, Weinberg, Salam, Feynman, and Gell-Mann. Finally such a wide ranging review would not be complete without General Relativity to which the last chapter is devoted.I enjoyed this book. However the presentation was a bit disjointed. The authors write for readers at varying levels bouncing back and forth between simple explanations and more difficult detailed ones. They insert apologies to those for who the material might be too complicated and for those who might get bored. While the math itself was not overly difficult, following it in terms of the concepts it represented was more demanding. Still I applaud the effort to put some accessible math behind concepts that are deep and not intuitive. Regardless of level this is a book for a non-scientist reader with a strong interest in the subject. Cox and Forshaw said the book was meant to be a challenge. It was and that made it worthwhile."
2,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3216-danielle,3,"I was expecting, from the first few paragraphs of the book, that I was going to breeze right through this. It didn't really happen that way. I had to take college physics, which included the basics of relativity and quantum theories, so I probably have a bit more knowledge than the average non-physicist. All the same, there were areas of this book that just did not seem to click at all, even after reading paragraphs over and over again. Usually the parts that didn't click were the ""easy"" examples such as how the distance between the moon and the Earth get further apart as the spin of the Earth slows. For anyone that doesn't know about conservation of rotational momentum, this is not an easy thing to figure out. Especially since they don't even mention momentum until 5 chapters later. I think many of the examples were well chosen, and the histories/biographies of the scientists leading up to Einstein were very interesting, but the book lacked a bit of flow and at times seemed to be lacking in proper explanation for the chosen examples until much later on (or sometimes never toward the end). The end of the book definitely seemed a little bit rushed, mainly due to the ""just take our word for it"" approach for what they deemed hard to understand topics. I understand this was attempting to make Einstein's theories accessible to lay people, but I feel it felt a little bit short."
3,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31197106-david,5,"I would love to say that I understood every word and every example of this book, but unfortunately there were many times I felt like the concepts were far too complicated for me. I'm not an unintelligent person but my math and physics knowledge is rather old and rusty.I'll give it another 2 or 3 read through before making any firm judgements on the books. I feel I have learned something from this book...I just don't know what it is I've learned.."
4,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003783-c,1,"Absolutely senseless. If he ever gets close to talking about the matter at hand, another long passage about a motorcyclist will pop up to ""explain things""Look. The reason you use so many horrible analogies is because you are a horrible explainer! Convey it the first time, don't waddle about."
5,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31021-kristin,4,"On a good day, high school physics class used to leave me feeling kind of (for lack of a better word) high. This book brought back that old, familiar feeling, but in an even better way. In the end, I walked away with a much clearer understanding of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity than I ever achieved slogging through high school physics. (I think our teacher must have been unable to articulate and synthesize the underlying questions that the equations sought to answer.) The authors--very slowly and gently, bringing in maths only when absolutely necessary--walk the reader through the major breakthroughs in science/physics that paved the way for Einstein's e=mc2. Then, they show us how Einstein arrived at e=mc2. This process is broken down into a few key steps: 1)an understanding that the speed of light is constant and therefore space and time must be ""variables""; 2) the mathematical definition of spacetime and the formula needed to relate events within it; and 3) the definition of vectors in spacetime. When vectors are broken down in spacetime, e=mc2 is revealed. It really is as simple as that. With an understanding of these key relationships, the elegance, beauty, and profound repercussions of the equation become crystal clear, even for those of us who never pursued physics beyond high school. I did struggle with a few sections, particularly the bits about electromagnetism, the conservation of rotational momentum, and--I hate to say it--the ""tiny physicists in elevators"" analogy. In spite of my mushy understanding of those parts, I was still able to ""go there"" with the authors in the end. The English major in me was a little miffed when they had a go at Murray Gell-Mann for taking his inspiration for the name ""quark"" from Finnegan's Wake, but otherwise I enjoyed the authors' playful, easygoing tone.

7,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"I’ve got rather mixed feelings about this one. I think writing a simple account of very difficult material is hard to achieve and so every such effort should be praised wherever it is found – but there is a fine line between simple and patronising and I’m not sure this one respects that line all of the time. It is clear these guys know their stuff, but I found it hard to concentrate on parts of this book as they would go into a longish chat about how hard the maths is and so how they have made the maths easier to understand than it should have been and by the time I’d drifted back to paying attention I felt I might have missed something along the way. I read this book, rather than listened to an audio book – where drifting off is more excusable - so I wouldn’t have expected drifting off to have been an issue. It also hasn’t helped that I started this and then spent three weeks in New Zealand with only having 30 pages left to read. I’m telling you all this because my problems with this book may have been related to my drifting off while reading it and with the long break in the middle of reading it.The best of this is how well they explain why it is not possible to travel faster than light – a really quite nice geometrical proof they offer. They also give a really nice discussion of the Higgs field and why finding the Higgs Boson is quite so important and why some physicists might choose to call it the ‘God Particle’. There are also some rather veiled digs made at Creationism and Intelligent Design which might have been better being said out loud rather than the curious sotto voce chosen here.All the same the bit I enjoyed the most was the part of Einstein’s special theory of relativity that has troubled me for years and I’ve never had a satisfactory answer to. This book doesn’t really answer all of my concerns – I’ve a feeling I would need to learn lots of maths and lots of physics to really understand what happens, but this book has been the best explanation I’ve found so far. My problem has been in trying to understand why the twin paradox happens? The twin paradox is where you have a pair of twins and you stick one of them in a spacecraft and her brother gets left here on earth. The twin in the spacecraft zaps off at near light speed for a few years and when she returns her brother has been dead for a million years or so. My problem with this has always been the ‘relativity’ part of it. If she is travelling off at near light speed and he is here drinking coffee at earth speed, why shouldn’t she consider him to be as moving off from her at near light speed and her not really moving at all? The answer, I’ve been told here and also told by Paul Davies in How to Build a Time Machine is that if she was going at near light speed the whole time then there would be no difference in their relative times and no way for either to know who was moving or who was still – but to get to those speeds she would need to accelerate and in coming back she would need to decelerate and it is those changes that make their relativity no longer work and for her to age effectively more slowly than someone left on earth. This was something nearly explained in The Fabric of the Cosmos, I think, although, not as well as is done here. In that book he talks about being in a spinning box in the middle of the universe and seeing the stars turning around you – how do you know it is you that is moving and not the stars. (When you think about it this is an amusing example, given Ptolemy, but his point is that you can tell you are moving and not the sky moving around you.) I think this all relates to Newton’s first law, the law of inertia. If a body is experiencing an accelerating force it therefore experiences the universe differently from one that is experiencing a lesser force. But I don’t think anyone ever really has explained to me why this might be the case. I might have missed it here, though, perhaps they did explain it. If they did I still don’t really get it. All of this stuff makes my head spin and so no matter how simply people seem to be able to write about it I still feel like I’m caught in some twisted logic I can’t quite follow. Why should accelerating make time slow down?All the same, the authors have gone out of their way to make this book as clear as they can – if I still don’t quite follow it is probably my own fault."
8,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"For those trying to nudge themselves into Einstein's world a little more, this book's title has great appeal. At some very general level, the equivalence of energy and mass can be understood, but the role of light (""c"") and light squared remains a challenge. The authors do a good job of describing how mass converts to energy (heat/photons/light carry away mass; when wood burns, energy is released and mass is reduced). In the reverse, energy adds to mass. When energy (heat) is added to mass, mass increases because energy itself has mass. At the heart of the understanding of reality, the authors make it clear that mass and energy are the same thing. They are not ""disconnected entitites."" Matter is, in short, ""capable of popping into and out of existence"" but (presumably) continues to exist as energy. This all prompts one to wonder what underlies and connects these two disconnected entities and why does conversion from one to the other occur. Is the ""pull - push"" phenomena related in the sense that mass pulls energy into itself and energy seeks to escape mass? Is concentrated energy in mass gravity? Is energy escaping mass ""liberation""? [The authors make a few references to ""liberated energy""]). If, as the authors note, the sun loses 4 million tons of mass every second in the form of radiated energy, does this mean that the earth is gaining some mass from that energy? While the authors are quite lucid here and there, their discussion of the role of light in Einstein's equation was frustratingly opaque. Intriguingly, they seem to suggest that the speed of light is not the central factor. It is, rather, a way to measure distance in a time direction, but it is not clear how time (spacetime) relates to the discussion that energy and matter are equivalent. The authors are clear that time and space are one thing, and that light years (a unit of time) can be used to measure distance. The authors seem to say that ""c"" is relevant because particles of light are massless. It's almost as if they are saying that at the speed of light there's no mass but only pure energy (but if this is so, how do photons/energy add to mass; if mass is shedded by radiated light, doesn't mass go with that light in some way?). Elsewhere, the authors say that spacetime is like ""cosmic maple syrup"" with some mass (Higgs field?). When that happens, does light pick up mass? The authors say other things about light that are also unlcear: that there's a cosmic speed limit and that there is such a thing as ""allocated speed"" and a cosmic ""speed quota,"" and that everything hurtles through spacetime at the same speed. All of this is somehow related to the ""c"" in the Einstein equation. At this point, it's an achievement for the lay reader to simply identify what he or she does not understand. This is all challenging stuff. Perhaps the real problem is the inability to transfer our earth-bound perspective as that has evolved to be into these cosmic realms that operate on such vastly different scales. "
9,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652517-merilee,5,"Superb review of latest in particle physics and spacetime. Cox explains things as clearly as possible, but I believe I will need to reread this before I could begin to explain any of it to anyone else.

10,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,4,"Who was this Adventure in Space-Time Written For?The challenge of writing any popular science book is that the audience has different levels of knowledge. The author needs to choose the appropriate level of knowledge to aim the writing at. It follows that the reader’s appreciation of the book depends on what they know. To understand my perspective, you should know my background:A long time ago I completed first year university science before switching into computers. I have since read a number of popular science books on relativity and quantum mechanics. I am presently taking on-line university physics courses to get a deeper understanding. I have thus seen many of the ideas in this book before, and understand the mathematics.The book begins with the claim, “We do not assume any prior scientific knowledge.” While the language is often simplistic, and they even explain the meaning of a divide sign, I think this is a compromise that does not really work. Frequently they give a hokey apology (I got very tired of chalk dust) and then present complex mathematics in prose. Important steps are often skipped. I can tell you that I had to read much of this book several times, and do the math on paper to try to understand it.Electricity and Magnetism Dance at the Speed of LightEinstein’s insight into the special role of the speed of light derives from Maxwell’s equations of electricity and magnetism. Following Einstein, the authors devote a chapter to this subject. This is fine with me, because I am taking my electricity course for precisely this reason. Briefly, experiments in the 19th century showed that a moving magnetic field generates electric current, and an electric current generates a magnetic field. These mutually reinforcing forces create an energy wave, which can be described by a wave equation. This equation gives us the speed at which the wave must travel, which turns out to be the same as the speed of light. Thus light is just another type of electromagnetic wave.Einstein assumed all movement is relative, and that the laws of physics are always the same no matter what is perceived to be doing the moving. Maxwell’s equations give us the speed of light without mentioning the motion of the source or the observer. His genius was to take this result literally, and conclude that the speed of light must always be constant no matter how it is measured.The book claims (on page 27) the speed of light is determined by the ratio of the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields. But peeking into the actual wave equation, I see that c = 1 / √(ε*μ), where ε and μ are the electrical “permittivity” and magnetic “permeability” constants respectively. That looks like a product to me, which makes intuitive sense if they are reinforcing each other. But this stuff is over my head, so did they oversimplify, or do I have it wrong?Riding the Relativity Railroad with PythagorasNow we get to the classic thought experiment of measuring the relative passage of time on a train from the perspective of an observer on the platform. The passenger measures time by shining a light from one position to another one meter above it. The observer on the platform sees the light taking a longer path because the light pulse is moving along with the train. As the speed of light is constant, the passenger’s clock must therefore appear to be running slower. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the rate at which time appears to slow down, known as time dilation. While it is cool that such basic math can be used to derive relativity, for some reason the author chooses not to call this by its usual name of Lorentz factor.This stuff seems to make sense when I read it, then I wake up in the middle of the night and it does not make sense any more. For example, I wondered if the above result is only true at the exact moment when the train passes the observer. No, it turns out that time dilation does not depend on the direction of motion. This is still not obvious to me, and I could have used an explanation in the book.I find it easy to get confused about which clock is running slower. I have to remind myself of (what I call) the Spoiled Princess Principle: You are the center of the universe. You do not move, everything else moves relative to you. Your clock always runs at the same rate. It is everybody else’s clock that is different.Stretching time does not seem as strange as the fact that space contracts in front of you when you are moving. The example he gives is that if we go fast enough, we can get to the Andromeda galaxy, which is three million light years away, in fifty years of our time. Are we going faster than light? No, my spoiled princess, remember that is only how it appears to you. How it looks to the people who sent you is coming up next.According to the equation, light, which goes the speed of light, takes no time at all to reach its destination. I don’t know why they don’t talk more about this. It suggests that a photon traveling between you and Andromeda is everywhere on its path simultaneously. Does this not mess with causality? Is there any connection with wave nature of particles in quantum mechanics?The Imaginary Single Speed in Minkowski Space-timeI was aware that travelling in space means that you also travel in time, and nothing can go faster than light. But the introduction of Minkowski space-time was a revelation. It begins with the observation we just made that distance in space changes depending on the relative motion of the observer. We can add a fourth dimension in time such that some quantity (distance “s”) is invariant no matter what speed the observer is moving. This new dimension is multiplied by the speed of light (c*t), so it becomes expressed in the same distance units as the other dimensions. But if we assume this is a Euclidean space, so that the Pythagorean triangle relationship s^2 = x^2 + (c*t)^2holds, we can get events that finish before they start. This violates causality, which means this model does not work. He then tells us “there is no other option” than to assume thats^2 = x^2 - (c*t)^2Not true, it is only one of many possibilities. But, of course, he knows the answer in advance. He then constructs a hyperbolic curve to demonstrate this relationship. It solves the causality problem, but visually the arithmetic is clearly false.I had to hunt around to discover that Minkowski space-time uses an (unfortunately so-called) “imaginary” time dimension, meaning a multiple of the square root of -1. Squaring it gives a negative number, hence the minus sign. Now it makes mathematical sense, but why did he not explain this? I still do not understand why, given that it is the time dimension that is “imaginary”, he subtracting the space dimension instead.Anyway, the amazing result is that the speed of light is not just a limit, it is the only possible speed! When we think we are standing still, we are zooming through the time dimension at the speed of light. When we move in space we have to slow down our movement through time to compensate.The Mystery of the Time Travelling TwinsI think the twin paradox is the key mystery in special relativity. One twin takes a round trip to Andromeda on a fast spaceship while his sister remains behind on Earth. When the travelling twin returns, he thinks it took one hundred years, but the Earth, including his sister, is now six million years older. The apparent speed-up in space is compensated by a vast increase in elapsed time, at least from someone’s point of view.After all the work we have done, I thought I was finally going to understand it. But at the end we are told the whole calculation fails because it does not take into account the acceleration required to turn the spaceship around. How can he do this to me?Lets jump ahead to the final chapter on General Relativity. We learn that acceleration and gravitational attraction are equivalent. We also learn that clocks run faster in weaker gravitational fields. This must mean that clocks run slower under higher acceleration. Is this why the travelling twin’s clock slowed down while he was turning around? Then why did he not make the connection?Well, lets go ask Mr. Internet. I’m back! Yikes, you would think this would have been figured out by now, but apparently not. The most common view is that, contrary to this book, the acceleration is irrelevant. Apparently the special relativity formula is correct, and there are ways to explain it with simple math. It would have been nice if he did this for us. So then, why do the effects of General Relativity make no additional difference? Ah, forget it, nobody answers my dumb questions.So wow, we can go anywhere in space as quickly as we want, and travel far into the future! The problem is that we are not photons – we have mass. Why does he not mention that it takes an ever increasing amount of energy to accelerate mass? Near the speed of light the energy required becomes infinite. I think of it as all the energy is going into moving in time rather than space, but I can’t connect this thought to what I learned about Minkowski space-time. Anyway, don’t expect to book your sci-fi trip anytime soon. Lose some weight first (like all of it).The Energy of Momentum in Space-TimeTo introduce the concept of momentum, we get a crash course on vectors, mass, Newton’s second law, and energy. Then we realize that a momentum vector in space does not work in relativity, so we must find an equivalent in space-time. The now familiar distance vector in space-time is transformed into a momentum vector, which is mass times velocity. To get there, we multiply by mass and by the velocity of light, then divide out the distance. Figuring this out from the text took a lot of work on my part. By trying to simplify, he actually made it a lot more difficult than it needed to be. In the end, we get of the standard momentum component (mass * velocity) in the space direction, and mass times the speed of light (m*c) in the time direction, both multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ). Because the total momentum must be conserved, the time direction (γ*m*c) must also be conserved. Therefore γ*m*c^2 is also conserved. Now he makes an approximation for the Lorentz factor, which is reasonably accurate at low speeds. The result is:m*c^2 + (1/2)*m*v^2This is interpreted as the sum of the energy contained in the mass (m*c^2) plus its kinetic energy. At zero velocity, we still have energy in the mass. We have just achieved the stated goal of the book. But what happens if we don’t cheat on the math? I can’t help thinking there is an important consequence at high speeds, such as what happens when you accelerate mass?A Good Learning Experience with Room for ImprovementAfter proving that E = m*c^2 he cannot resist going on to presenting the Entire Standard model, with its master equation that shows how every particle reacts with every other particle. So far I have been feeling sorry for the scientifically challenged trying to read this book, but now I experienced being one of them. The verbal description made sense, but without knowing what the symbols or operators mean, constantly referring back to the equation just got in the way. I think this book could have been better if they accepted they are writing for two different levels of knowledge. The equations could then be presented properly in a text box, accompanied by a text description of what they mean, followed by a philosophical summary for the non-mathematical reader. Better still, they could provide supplementary material on the web to answer my questions. I suppose this review is really a long confession of ignorance. I learned a lot from this book, and more from the research to make sense of it. While I still don’t completely get it, this journey into the mystery of space and time was well worth it."
11,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars.The writing of science books is a difficult task. On one hand, you have a ready market of science nerds that will instantly pick up your book (an easy sale), but they want hard facts, maths and challenging concepts. On the other hand you have a large mass market audience wanting desperately to learn more about science but if you dive in with the hard facts, maths and challenging concepts you are (possibly) going to lose some of them along the way and turn them off science. So what do you do?Brian Cox has made a living on bring science to the masses and having heard him speak a few times now when he has been in Australia it is always such a delight to see the diverse crowds that rock up to see him talk. If any-one was able to please both groups - I would put money on it being him.While I found this book to be a really solid read (and will definitely read it a second time), I unfortunately think the audience of the book is unclear. The book starts out quite gently with some very easy to get your head around concepts about space and time, the speed of light and special theory. I was speeding through these chapters feeling pretty confident with everything I was reading and coming up with a few good examples to incorporate into my work. Then there is a sudden switch to spacetime momentum vectors that had me trying to recall study from years ago and wishing desperately that I had a pen and paper (note: next time bring pen and paper). So just when you go ""yes...we are ramping this up a little"" it then switches to quite inane topics again (let me explain scientific notation to you....hmmm...if I got through spacetime diagrams and spacetime momentum vectors I think I got scientific notation and why scientists use such big numbers). The jumping back and forth between baby steps and elephant steps just made me feel a little confused (and dizzy). I also wonder if the authors solo wrote specific chapters as the voice (way of explaining) did seem to change throughout and that also mixed up my rhythm with the book a little (and added to the dizzy). Overall, I think the authors did an admirable job on a difficult topic/market. So hats off to them both. So if you are a hard-core physics geek, maybe skip the book and grab a textbook. If you are totally new to this field ...jump in but be prepared for a shaky journey. If you are in the middle, bring pen and paper and enjoy the bumps.Reading ChallengeAussie Reader's 2020 April Opposites Challenge: Read a book of fiction and a book of non-fiction"
12,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,4,"2020 TBR Challenge: Read a book you don't remember why you added or boughtI really enjoy Brian Cox, I watched his series Wonders of Life ages ago, and I've always liked seeing him on various panel shows etc. He is incredibly intelligent (to state the obvious), but gets across ideas in an accessible and easily understood way, and has a great sense of humour to boot.This all extends to Why Does E=mc²? - I still don't think I fully grasp any of the concepts explored in it, I have never had a brain that is wired in the right way to 'get' physics intuitively like some people I know, but this book certainly got me the closest, and inspired me to do some research off my own back to see if I can at least say I understand something.Why Does E=mc²? regularly made me laugh out loud with some of its analogies and turns of phrase, which are a fantastic and welcome break after several pages of frowning, squinting at the page, and grappling to understand relativity.Probably a book I'll read again to try to cement my understandings. Very much enjoyed it."

A bit difficult to follow at times and I still have a few technical questions that I'll need to look-up myself, but I still learned a lot! While the progress we've made is astounding, I can't help but feel a bit of despair at the thought of how this progress was achieved sometimes (see the Minkowski spacetime ""why not try Pythagora's theorem with a minus sign???"") and all the ""forced"" assumptions we've made when shaping our theories (e.g. the demands of causality when shaping up the spacetime ""rules"")Definitely recommend it!

But this isn’t for you - it’s for all people that are curious about Einstein and our universe, can follow a logical discussion, but are not technical enough to follow a more detailed explanation. Not that this isn’t detailed, but Cox and Forshaw go to great lengths to hold your hand along the way and explain it all, using analogies and not a lot of maths to make their point.And it works. You might feel a bit lost at times, but things will fall into place. And hopefully you will also be able to appreciate the beauty of Einstein’s ideas."
17,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5640245-brigitta,0,"(I never say this, but thank goodness I read this book in Hungarian. It was difficult enough without having to try and decipher what are the Hungarian equivalents of all the terms.)I have been meaning to read this book every since it came out in Hungarian, but now it seemed like just the light summer read I needed… which, of course, it isn’t, but I’m fairly certain that I’d find some parts of it very complicated even in winter, so what the hell. My main motivation to read this book was Brian Cox himself (I know, I’m that shallow), because I’ve been fascinated with his lectures and telly programmes, and since I had my fair share of brilliant and brilliantly mediocre science teachers in my time, I had to realize how important presentation actually is. For a long time I considered myself devoid of any kind of scientific interest, but then I had to realize that everything is interesting if explained properly – and I think this book is further proof of my theory.Interesting, however, doesn’t necessarily mean easily accessible. The authors certainly try and explain even simple concepts, e. g. what exponentiation means, but let’s be real, if someone meets exponentiation here for the first time, best of luck with the rest. In any case, the authors make it clear that if you don’t want to bother with the maths, you can skip the hardcore parts and still enjoy the rest – which is true, but sometimes I felt my brain bent in ways it doesn’t usually bend, but it was a nice experience, I missed it. I have noticed that several readers criticized this book for either talking down to the audience or for being to complicated, but once again, let’s be real, this is what happens when you try to talk to a wide range of people with heterogeneous backgrounds. You can’t please everyone, but I think the authors handled these challenged as well as they could be handled.I have to admit that a significant part of this book went over my head, despite all the best efforts of Messrs. Cox and Forshaw, but I don’t think that’s a problem. It challenged my views, I have learnt a lot and it definitely raised my interest and inspired me to learn more, so I got everything out of this book that I’d hoped for."

I bought this as further reading on an iTunes U course I'm doing, thinking that it would offer further insight. The first half of the book is so patronising that I could barely bring myself to claw through it (but unfortunately I have a Magnus Magnusson approach to reading). This merely added to the annoying impression that the authors are explaining all the n a s t y, d i f f i c u l t s c i e n c e y - w i e n c e y v e r y s l o w l y t o y o u. B e c a u s e y o u ' r e s t u p i d. The over-use of analogies in an attempt to ""simplify"" the mathematics, theories, discoveries etc, does nothing but confuse you, and I would recommend, if you do decide to read this book, that you skip anything referring to motorbike riders, billiard balls, cannon balls, or anything that starts to look like an apology for teaching you something in a book about science, that you have chosen to read. On the upside however, once you reach the apex so to speak, and your tiny, limited little brain has been gently guided through all the scary bits that lead to Einstein's equation, then things get kind of interesting, and much less patronising. Chapters 6 and 7 were much more enjoyable and far easier to understand once the authors felt they could trust you not to dissolve into a quivering wreck of unteachable mush.So all in all, a bit of a disappointment, but there are nuggets of lovely knowledge in this book which I'm glad I've discovered. Now on to my next challenge!"
19,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7138526-john,2,"Why is E=mc^2? It was an enormous ask, and Cox and Forshaw were never going to deliver.It is easy reading, but unless you understand maths you won't get it at all.When I read on page 77 ""although we did not prove (the maths)"" I began to feel cheated, and then they tried to explain in several thousand words space-time vectors, which could have been done in two lines of maths, then I thought to myself it would have been much easier if they had used the maths throughout, and dispensed with all those words and all that repetition.It is not a bad read, but I wouldn't want to read it twice."

21,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34019657-jorge,4,"""In following the book up to this point, you may well be juggling a lot of mental balls as you read this sentence"". Cox and Forshaw say this at some point halfway through the book, but it might as well be applied to my feelings when finishing it. I don't really know how to criticize, comment or even rate it (for the most of the reading I was pretty sure I would leave no rating at all). I started in August, read a couple of chapters and loved it; never had I understood relativity and physics so well since I was reading Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"". Then, everything went worse.Maybe it was the fact that I left the book on the shelves for a couple of months, maybe it was that I was reading it in English language, maybe I didn't read it thoroughly enough, or maybe, and most probably, I'm just stupid, but I struggled to understand most of the chapters that followed, regarding spacetime, Einstein equations, the fabric of reality and so on. Some things I did not get a single word; some others, I understood them (kind of) but was unable to explain the concept to others, usually a good way to know if you really understand something. From particle physics onwards the reading was much more enjoyable, and I wasn't forcing myself to finish the book anymore, 'cause I was back to understanding it, but still... My brain was at the point of melting form a good deal of pages.So, I just don't know. 4/5 because Cox and Forshaw are good writters and explainers, and they know how to make the text appealing to the reader, keeping mathematical complexities at a minimum; still, loses one star because their intention was for non-scientists readers to get a good grasp of Einstein's theory and its importance and, at least in my case, they only achieved that to a very limited extent."
22,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,4,"So, first of all, this is a lovely little introduction to relativity, both special and general, produced with just the right amount of math to make all the concepts clear without too many confounding and always unhelpful analogies (though at times it did feel a bit patronizing – they spend quite a while explaining, for example, the concept of a variable that, if you don’t already have in your toolbox, pretty likely means you will not be able to follow any of the math anyway).Now, how this was supposed to work as an audiobook is just beyond me. Had I not already gone through the math several times previously, and had I not entered this book with a pretty solid idea of all the stuff they were about to cover, I would have been hopelessly confounded by the “explanations”. Don’t get me wrong, some of the descriptions, histories and analogies are spot on and convey quite beautifully the mind-bending ideas of relativity. However, to kick things off and at certain crucial points, the authors use actual math, and while (I assume) that can be relatively easily followed on paper/screen with anyone capable of doing basic algebra, it was damn near impossible to follow in audio format after a while, especially when they are doing a complex bit of formula juggling and then reference a variable that they derived and set aside a couple of minutes earlier. Maybe there are people whose brains are capable of storing, handling, and juggling ephemeral audio data like that, but mine sure as hell isn’t.That feeling of a lack of consideration for the format was further compounded by the fact that the audiobook has an index, where the narrator “helpfully” spends about an hour reading off an enormous list of words with corresponding page (?) numbers."
23,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63319555-rachel-welton,4,"There are some books that are enhanced by metamorphosis into audiobook, and others that need to remain firmly in the realm of the written word. Jeff Forshaw manfully reads out the equations but I couldn't manage to conjure them up in my mind's eye. The numerous analogies were enlightening, and I certainly feel I have learned things that I didn't know before, however often there was a big, unexplained leap from analogy to completion, possibly at the speed of light, or failing that at the square root of c^2-v^2 which tends to 1 if you get near a neutron star.... where was I? Oh, yes, I need to go through it a couple more times before I will have absorbed it all."

30,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6098128-huw-evans,5,"Brain (sic) Cox is one of the current pin-up boys of science; ex pop musician, he is now a physicist working at the LHC in Switzerland when he isn't gadding about the world for his latest TV series or recording The Infinite Monkey Cage for BBC Radio 4 (listen if you get the chance - it is brilliant). There are many explanatory books about the theories of Relativity, most of which are so up there own backsides that they are unreadable unless you have a degree in theoretical physics. Cox and Forshaw conquer by stooping low enough to make the subject intriguing, interesting and intelligible.  Of all the equations known to man Einstein's final statement of the Special Theory of Relativity is probably the one that is best known to educated man. Ee equals emm see squared (and I apologise for altering the title, I can't get my computer to generate a squared symbol) generated a wholly different view of the universe to the one that had held sway since the time of Isaac Newton. The problem was that, as experimental physics became more precise, nice and accurate, the answers generated by Newtonian physics were not supported. The difference may have been in terms of more decimal places than Newton ever envisaged but there was a level of inconsistency that could not be ignored. As Richard Feynman said (paraphrased), ""If the evidence doesn't fit the theory is wrong"".The other equation most people remember is ascribed to Pythagoras; the square of the hypotenuse in a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. From this, via Newtonian laws of motion and electromagnetism Cox and Forshaw take us on a journey to explain how Einstein came to his conclusions and what their impact is on our understanding of the universe and (almost) everything within it. The steps taken are gentle, well explained and the mathematics is not particularly taxing. Physics, theoretical and experimental, has evolved over time as our abilities to investigate have improved; it is the downside to being a particularly clever monkey. Asking questions about how things work has been our curse, the ability to find some answers our blessing. We are now at the stage where we can force streams of particle to accelerate to near light speed, smash them together and analyse the results to see whether they match what has been predicted.This book is as much about the history of human thought and discovery as it is about mathematics. It is also about numbers that are so small or so large that they are mind boggling. It introduces that mathematics of spacetime in a way that arouses curiousity, rather than fear. Moreover it is a very honest book; it does not claim that Einstein's theories explain everything but that it produces a picture that is more accurate than the previous theories. Until the next one."
31,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This is a great introduction to understanding how energy has been converted to mass and back into energy, creating every bit of known matter. The first part of the book introduces the reader to the concept of e=mc2, in very simple and easy to understand terms. In the second part of the book, the authors breakdown the equation to teach any curious learner the math behind the equation. Even if you are not interested in breaking down the math, I would still highly recommend this book if you are curious about special or general relativity.I found the 3rd part of the book to be the most enjoyable. The authors give a fantastic and extremely easy to understand survey of the various types of stars in the universe. Stars are one of my favorite things to read about, and I have read my share of books about them. I would definitely say these authors excelled at explaining the relationship between mass and type of star as well as the forces at work to keep stars active. There is a beautiful dance that exists between the inward pull of gravity and the outward push of fusion and electron repulsion. The way the authors organized this discussion was so simple and beautiful. I think anyone interested in the dynamics of stars would love this book. They did not mention my favorite star, the brown dwarf. That was a tiny bit disappointing.The final part of the book gave an extremely brief summary of the standard model as well as a summary of some of the particles accelerators and wave detectors. The authors chose not to bog the reader down with the various particles of the standard model. They were more interested in trying to help the reader understand how these particles are at work in e = mc2. I would definitely recommend this book for someone who is looking for an introduction or a refresher. "
32,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,5,"I've been a fan of Brian Cox for years. His infectious enthusiasm, his ability to boil down complex concepts for an average dude without a physics degree, and his clear passion for what he does, make him compelling viewing.So after seeing him and Jeff Forshaw lecture on the subject of this book, I decided to get a bit more in depth and check out the book.It’s excellent. The guys are able to help me to understand and visualise relativity. This is easier said than done with such a counter-intuitive topic, and they do it with style.They look at space, time, spacetime, relativity and mass. They bring in a bit of chemistry making things clear that I didn’t get at school.The last book I read on this topic was Hawking’s Brief History which was rubbish. Badly written and impenetrable.I came from this book with a much clearer understanding of E=mc^2, particle physics and where we’re going with the latest research.I’ll read it again for sure. "
33,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937339-s-p,2,"From the man that bought us the 1997 New Labour election theme tune, comes a book about the origins and meaning of Einstien's E-Mc2.The main problem with the book is there is far too much going on about 'deeper understanding' and time spent telling us how things are being explained to us poor intellectually subnormal non physicists in v e r y s i m p l e t e r m s so we can keep up. If you can get over the condescending tone, and the jumbled narrative (too many tangents), the information is easy to comprehend - in that the book does what it reputes to do, explains why E-mc2 in language that make sense. It could, with a bit of revising, drop about 100 pages - maybe use the space to move into more of the quantum stuff, or even allow more space for more organised explanations of background information. "
34,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1795309-robb,3,"I felt like this book went back and forth between being written in real simple terms to being hard to follow mathematics written in narrative form. It went back and forth between being exciting to being boring in its presentation of equations, and that's coming from a math major who enjoyed every math class I had in school. Some of the concepts in the book, which are considered by some to be basic and foundational to modern physics, are truly fascinating to ponder. I love stretching my brain thinking of the implications of how much energy is all around us, and what it would be like to travel close to the speed of light. So I would say I really enjoyed about half the book, and the other half was either hard to follow or boring. "
35,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5256904-nicol,3,"This was really well written for the lay person, covering the early history of physics and how we came to these equations and what we use them for...but I had to renew the book at the library for another month because one isn't enough to fully absorb all the information this book covers. I'm sure it's a breeze for an MIT student, but since it was written for my level of science (meaning zero) I need more time to wrap my brain around these concepts that are completely new to me (because my high school physics teacher lost me from day one and that was a long time ago). But with my hobby being radio astronomy, I really want to understand what's behind the surface of our Universe and how the heck it works. Brian Cox is a stellar teacher."
36,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5848237-j-f-lawrence,5,"I had never been able to grasp fully the 'basic' explanations of relativity before I read this excellent book. Ok, Iwas fine with the concept of space not being absolute, but that was about it. I certainly had no real idea why time should pass at different speeds according to one's frame of reference or why spacetime makes sense of things. And as for why energy should be equivalent to mass x the speed of light and why this matters for causality, well forget it.But thanks to 'Why Does E=mc2 and Why Does It Matter?' I can honestly say that the Einsteinian account of the universe makes complete sense. I feel considerably smarter after having read it, and no longer will physics graduates kick sand in my face."
37,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3172434-joanna,5,"I loved this book - it actually takes you through the processes of deriving e=mc2 and provides the necessary context on people and theory to understand the meaning behind what this equation means. Good detail. Good big picture. Also sheds some light on the experiments the lovely people at CERN are doing. I had to re-read several sections (some many times) to really get it but it was well worth it. The math gets pretty deep towards the middle (you can skip it, but it's there if you're inclined to follow) and I remember sitting at the Munich airport waiting for my flight home from a snowboarding trip working out the equations by hand on the back of a napkin stained by apple strudel trying to find my way to e=mc2...and I did! Awesome light bulb moment."

It makes it so much easier to understand if you have a passing knowledge of Pythagoras. Loved the explanations of how the counter-intuitive properties of the universe were derived from simple rules. Lots of 'ah-ha!' moments for me, especially when talking about ""everything travels at the speed of light"", and ""distances are smaller at faster speeds"".A really enlightening book, although I was only just hanging onto the maths at the end when pulling apart the Standard Model equation."
39,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15656262-john-rauch,4,"The information in this book was incredible. The delivery sometimes made it more difficult than necessary. I don't believe that every book should have to be ""beginner"" level, but if you're going to claim that anyone can read it, maybe spend a little extra time working out some good analogies to explain simple concepts or give explanations that don't always require advanced math to grasp. I think I understood the majority of the book, but there were some sections I had to read multiple times to understand, then once I did, could easily think of better ways to explain it myself. Aside from that, I think this is a great read for someone really interested in physics."

I couldn't believe they pulled off a non mathematical treatment of 4-vectors (although it may not have been worth it for the layperson). Some of the later chapters were a bid hurried, but their generalization of the speed of light to the speed of massless particles and their treatment of energy mass equivalence in everyday life was fantastic!"

It does a fantastic job of explaining how things that seem to contradict our own good senses work and why. Time is relative. What does that really mean? How does it impact our experience of the universe and technologies? Answers in here. Space and time are malleable and subjective. Real objects do shrink when they move. To use an example from the book, if you were trying to fit a 4m car into a 3.9m garage, you could if the car was moving at 22 percent of the speed of light. Before it bursts through the back wall. But you get the point. The book then goes on to explain spacetime- a way of understanding the universe that's- well universal. Accurate regardless of the observation point in space. They derive this concept and again, it's fascinating.But ultimately, while it describes the brilliance and experimental validation of Einstein's relativity, he also leaves you excited for the next step- at the precipice of a totally new understanding of the universe. He talks about quantum theory and that it can't be meshed with relativity... and reminds us that as soon as something better comes along, relativity may be revised or replaced. But that doesn't make it any less special and in fact, that's the exciting thing about science! Relativity replaced Newton's understanding of gravity and it will continue to evolve as we discover new things. Newton's understanding, which we know now to be more an approximation, helped us engineer bridges and skyscrapers. Einstein's gave us the GPS satellite system. What will we get with the next great theory?That being said, this book was published in 2009. So much has happened since. I actually got to look up the results of one of the ongoing experiments he described and saw the results, which was kind of awesome. Ultimately, this book peaked my interest and had me looking for more. And gave me the framework to understand the importance of experiments taking place right now. A few good quotes:""Einstein was undoubtedly one of the great practitioners of the art of science, but as we have emphasized throughout this book, he was led to his radical revision of space and time by the curiosity and skill of many. he was not a freak of nature and his intellect was not supernatural. He was simply doing what great scientists do: He took simple things seriously and followed through the consequences logically.""""'From the simplest of ideas'... if there were ever to be an epitaph written for humanity's greatest scientific achievements, it might begin with these five words. Taking delight in observing and considering the smallest and seemingly most insignificant details of nature has led time and again to the most majestic of conclusions.""""Our musings on the nature of space and time have led us to understand that the earth is doing nothing more than falling in a straight line around the sun. It's just that the straight line is in a curved spacetime, which manifests itself as a (nearly) circular orbit in space."""
55,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62747656-shreyansh-jain,4,"Picked this with up some apprehension after the semi-disappointment that ""Quantum universe"" by the same authors was, but happy to conclude that this book was much better.The explanations for constancy of speed of light, Minkowski ST, invariant distances and momentum were pretty good. The English explanation of standard model and especially the Higgs mechanism was quite good. There are many details that were fudged over or poorly explained (the super condensed write up on white dwarfs - neutron stars - black holes, or how exactly does general relativity not enmesh with standard model, or the lack of dark matter from the book altogether). But I guess that is to be expected when you are looking for a ""condensed"" course on relativity AND quantum electrodynamics from an author who insists upon the assumption that even the slightest amount of math would turn his readers away.A good effort overall but wanted a bit more. I would recommend this to high school or freshmen nerds to spark their interst in theoritical physics and to develop a real appreciation for the genius of Maxwell and Einstein. There arent many authors in this niche so your options are somewhat limited if you want to learn about this stuff when not preparing for a graded exam."
56,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66196977-benj,3,"Quite an enthralling ride, but I got pretty lost about half-way through. I suspect that the problem is that the authors know their subject so well, they can't always see when they have to slow down to allow the layman time to catch up.I also found a couple of their mathematical processes a bit dubious. Trying to calculate an absolute space/time distance s, and broadly based on Pythagoras, they postulate that s2 is equal to ct2 + x2 (sorry, I can't work out how to make the 2 a superscript to denote squared). When that is shown to be false, they then say that the only alternative is s2 = ct2 - x2, which is so obviously bad logic that they have to include an appendix to justify it. I don't doubt that they're right, but their explanation was unconvincing to me.In another case, they're happily working through some equations, and then decide to change one of them to a completely different one. They prove arithmetically that these two equations are so nearly the same that it doesn't matter, but I would have got my knuckles severely rapped if I'd tried anything like that in A-level maths. As this equation is the one that eventually leads to E=MC2, I felt a little bit cheated."
57,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28920845-josefine,4,"Such an interesting book for all of us who want to understand, but maybe don't want to spend many years studying theoretic physics at Oxford (though that does sound pretty cool).Let me relieve you: No, I must certainly did not understand everything in this book. If we are being fair, I actually think I only fully understood to about chapter 5. After that things went fuzzy. However, I am walking away with this book feeling just slightly smarter, and with a more abstract idea of the universe, which is what really matters.What this book needs, is to be accompanied by some youtube videos. They do, for the most part, a great job of explaining the thought experiments, but I feel like it could have benefited from some visual aid. Preferably a bit slower.That said, with some videos, a future reread, and maybe a possible chat with an expert in the field, I feel as though I should be able to scrape together the parts I missed out on.Can recommend to everyone who is curious about the universe we live in. Nothing is absolute, everything is relative!"
58,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14106330-amy-suzanna,3,"With this book it appears it was a case of third time lucky. I'm fairly certain that I've only made two previous attempts to read Why Does E=mc²? before, but it might have been more. About third of the way through, I remembered why I'd always given up - the maths may be fairly tricky, but the mildly patronising asides about how difficult it is and the lengthy (and in my view oversimplified) analogies annoyed me. Now a decade old, the science in this book is still important and often misunderstood. Explaining the concept of spacetime, quantum physics and how the standard model we currently use is not  quite  right, can seem impossible, particularly if your audience is not scientifically minded and/or has very little knowledge of maths. My problems with the writing style are merely personal taste, an annoyance tainting what is otherwise a very good book. I can't help thinking, however, how differently the ending might be if it was written today. In 2007, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN had yet to find the Higgs boson and therefore prove a prediction that quantum physics had long been based upon. Perhaps now is the time for Professors Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw to produce a new edition."
59,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919112-daniel-bratell,2,"I want to love a book like this, a book that guides the reader or listener to amazing scientific insights. Unfortunately I did not because the book's general attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Don't ask me why.A few tangible things:* The book (at least the edition I consumed) is dated. For instance, the Higgs boson was found by the Large Hadron Collider a couple of years after this book was written. * It explicitly avoids even letting the user get a glimpse of any complicated math. Just to be able to pretend everything is very simple. A lot is very simple. All is not very simple.* It avoids mentioning things that complicates the current picture, except when saying over and over again that some day we might figure out even better theories and models. For instance, if time is like any other dimension in spacetime, why can't it move backwards? All in all it dumbs down things a bit too much. I'm probably just not in the book's target audience, so what book should I read instead?"
60,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67204030-louis,4,"grabbed this quickly from the audiobook section of the library as my toddler was pulling the shelves apart. Very Glad I did. While I had to let go of the fact I wasn't going to follow the math in my head while commuting; however, I did go home and reproduce the ""proof"" of relativity using a train moving like an example they use in the book. and any book that inspires someone to do math must be at least half decent. I really liked how they bounced around from the math to the thought experiments. as someone who sees's big picture and concepts fairly easily it was fun to understand and then try to follow the math. enjoyed both parts of the book. the history of building up to E=mc2 and then the 2nd half talking about modern physics was fascinating. I didn't really understand how the title applied to it though. Great epitaph. the kind of teaching I hope my boys get in high school. either form reading or a real teacher. "
61,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"This book presents relativity extremely well for the layperson. It might even edge out Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe for the explanation of why time expands and the derivation of the formula Einstein gave for addition of velocities in special relativity.The formula can be explained once you get time expansion and a distance formula (almost the Pythagorean theorem, but a version for non-Euclidean geometry).The latter half of the book, in which they present and explain most of what they call ""The Master Equation,"" which covers the non-gravity forces in the universe, lost me. I could follow along at an extremely high level, but not much more than that.But it made physics really accessible. If you're curious about understanding what relativity really means, this is a great, non-scary book.My edition also credits Jeff Forshaw as an author."

I have learned so much on those topics from reading (multiple times) his essay collections. True joy is to be found in those books (including his funny personal anecdotes). This book was really hard to read despite the marketing that it is aimed at science laymen. While it is true I could understand some individual parts of what he was saying - from a higher, macro level I have no idea what the point of the book was. It was a confusing mess. It did not help that he would frequently start to explain something and then state ""we'll get to that later"". This left me with so many dangling thoughts, I was totally lost as to what his point of all this jabber is supposed to be. Had to force myself to finish reading and was left completely unfulfilled at the end."
63,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,4,"Admittedly, I am not a big fan of popular science books. Science without the unromantic exploration of mathematical rigors is simply a bland list of the writer's claims. Plus, books like these give people who don't understand science the false impression that they do; and that's just dangerous. Look at how many people on social networks pretended that they understood the underlying concept of the gravitational waves. That was one of my cutest days on the internetHowever, I liked this one. Well, I am little biased towards Brian Cox. I kind of like the guy. Plus, he has this Feyman-esque capability to come up with fantastically simple analogues for seemingly recondite concepts. I always struggled a bit with Minkowsi's Space-time hyperbolic. This book finally connected the dots for me. So thanks for that"
64,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,4,"I found this book both frustrating and riveting. I'm abysmal at maths, so portions of the book that were heavy on the mechanics of the equations mentioned left me a little bored when I couldn't completely follow (not to mention depressed about not being good at adding). But then the non-math heavy parts were very engaging and it was hard to not get caught up in the enthusiasm of the authors. There were places I wished for more of an explanation and things I found would have been useful if they had been mentioned earlier, but overall I was very glad I stuck with the book. I got a sense of what went into that one small equation that says so much about the universe. It's pretty awe-inspiring.Also, a million points to any book that makes you stick your hand in the air and smile as you imagine heaps of neutrinos passing through your thumb. Very cool."

It explains many mindbending concepts of spacetime, quantum mechanics and relativity. If you don't have much interest, this will sail right over your heads. Though it explains in a very layman language without use of maths. This books covers so many dizzying mindbending concepts ,it can be hard to process as many of them are also related to each other."

They are challenging, inspiring, mind-blowing, exciting, and usually deeply thought provoking. This book seemed to lack all of that, except for the challenging part. I expected more out of Brian Cox. I think he is a good TV host, but he fails where Carl Sagan succeeds. He is no Carl Sagan. I still gave it four stars because I learned stuff even if I didn't understand everything. I went in thinking it was going to be different than it was. That is not the fault of the authors, that is my own fault. So four stars for subject matter. Meh on mind-blowing, life changing thoughts on the universe. I will have to go elsewhere for that. I'll give him another shot, but if his next book doesn't do it for me, then I am out."

This book offers a beautifully lucid and understandable explanation of Relativity and, as a bonus, the Standard Model. Although you won't walk away with an expert level understanding (obviously) it will certainly upgrade your layperson's understanding of just how fascinating and beautiful these theories really are. Covers concepts in depth that most books only touch on - things like symmetry, invariants, particles with zero rest mass, and the fact that light moving at the universal speed limit is actually largely a coincidence - the real explanation of c turns out to be much more interesting. Definitely worth the read for anyone interested in modern physics."

This book explains why – for example – time really does slow down when clocks speed up (and so why we age more slowly when we travel more quickly). Abundantly illustrated with easy-to-grasp analogies (as well as a lot of background tales from the history of science), Professors Cox and Forshaw do an excellent job of opening this subject up to the ordinary reader – it’s clear they’re used to explaining counterintuitive theories to folk whose experience is limited to the everyday.

I also love the fact that they tell you a equation, then what it is for, and then they give you really life examples of it so you could understand it from every aspect. I also feel like I learned a lot from this book that I wouldn’t really learn in school. I also feel like that 250 pages is not to much and not to less and that it was a good happy medium.

So despite the simplistic start, halfway through I was drowning.It starts so simplistic that by the time you don't know what Cox is talking about it's too late. You reread a few paragraphs and then a few pages and then you know you're not figuring this out without starting over. So you push through to the end knowing full well that you're never going to understand how a massless photon can have energy and e=mc^2 can be true. You mark off in goodreds as good as me can.

I have to admit I still do not fully understand. My intuition is still limited to Newtonian physics.However, the power of logical reasoning and empirical evidence tells me I have to trust Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum physics. The new paradigm has to be closer to the truth of the universe.At least I learned that the fabric of space-time itself implies mass, energy, and momentum are interchangeable through the famous formula E = mc2. The book even goes further to quantum physics to explain how matter could be created and can have mass.Sometimes it is harder to let go of my prior gut feeling and follow the flow of logic."

I found the first half of the book (chapters 1-5) more enjoyable than the second half because I think I found it more understandable. In this half the authors explain the concept of spacetime and how Einstein came to form his theories of special and general relativity based on the works of previous scientists before him. Overall a challenging but mind-opening and satisfying exploration of physics. "

106,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64511955-daniel-hejnar,5,This book has blown my mind over and over again..
107,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46692221-james-hauenstein,3,"I gave it 3 stars because it really slows down when they start doing the math. You can say it’s a little over my head I guess, but it still seemed tedious to me."

109,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76946755-volo-bonetskyy,5,Just read it. Authors made a great job explaining hard physical principles with the simple language.
110,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47090146-wood-duck,3,A little dry
111,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4004839-heather,3,I'll be honest; this lost me halfway through. 
112,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90599715-layla-adanero,4,You'll need to be familiar with the certain theories the book touches up on but it definitely contained a lot of insight into various topics. I found myself re-reading paragraphs and sections.
113,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19018861-adrian,5,Such a well written and accessible science book.

116,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44317411-liam-joyce,3,Found it very interesting - but sometime tough to follow sometimes - that is not due to the book - more my concentration sometimes!
117,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79374983-kristopher-driver,5,Absolutely fantastic. Everyone must read this.

119,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64457836-andrey,5,"Really good book. Authors tried to explain complex things in a very easy manner. Some places here require math knowledge, but the overall explanation is great and deep enough"
