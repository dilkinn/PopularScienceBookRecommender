0,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/819-erin,1,"It's been a busy couple of weeks, so I thought I'd spent the last of my holiday indulging in a witty travelogue to set my feet itching. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong book. Years of declining the advice of the Bryson-worshipers, it seems, was not in vain.I'm halfway through, and - like the author on the daunting trail - am unsure as to whether or not I can finish my task. Bryson sounds, to put it mildly, a real jerk. He's smug and superior, and spends most of the book complaining about his companions on the trail. A common motif is how everyone one is but a weekend hiker, that he is a true back-to-nature type in comparison. True, some of his encounters sound less than thrilling, but even the obnoxious woman he encounters should get credit for tackling the trail by herself. Instead, she's unceremoniously ditched (in real life as well as print) by the man who couldn't stomach the thought of going alone. He enlists the companionship of a long-lost friend with whom he'd proven incompatible on a previous travel experience. Said ""friend"" is then derided throughout the book for his sloth, roughness in manner, and lowbrow tastes. Meanwhile, Bryson paints himself as Guardian of the Trail, criticising the Parks Service along with all who venture through her woods.I'm still waiting for even a glimpse of the much-vaunted Bryson wit and charm to show itself. At the moment, he's nothing more than the stereotypical Blue Stater - putting himself on a pedestal while looking down his nose at everyone else. It's not attractive, and it makes for a very frustrating read. I wish he'd stayed home."
1,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,3,"I am what some might call a pussy hiker. I do genuinely enjoy a leisurely stroll in the “mountains” of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. I like the pretty views. I always bring my conveniently-sized L.L. Bean backpack ($39.95 from the Kittery Outlets) so I have a place for my camera and cell phone. But by early afternoon, I would like to be done, please. I would like to be done and sitting at a booth in a pub with my burger and beer. Camping is certainly worthy of consideration, but here’s the deal: I don’t do rain. In light of the fact that weather reports are unreliable beyond a 48-hour window (and even that is pushing it in New England), it is unlikely I would ever camp for more than a two-night stay. Oh, and if I were to camp, I would like it to be at a site that has free Wi-Fi.What this amounts to is that the Appalachian Trail, endearingly referred to by those hiking it as “the AT,” will never be anything more to me than a lovely little map.
(click to enlarge)
BUT. I am glad for gung-ho people like Bryson and his chubby checker friend Katz who did walk “the AT” and are kind enough to let me know what I am missing. As it turns out, I am not missing much. This is not to downplay the extraordinarity of a 2,200-mile trail of wilderness running from Georgia to Maine, a trail that takes the average thru-hiker six months to complete, but in terms of day-to-day variation, it is basically a shitload of trees followed by another shitload of trees.

For me, this book makes a better argument for the day hike. There are many parts of the trail I would enjoy, including the Smoky Mountains, the Shenandoah Valley, and the Delaware Water Gap. Like Bryson, though, I am a people person, and I enjoy my simple human comforts. I would like to see these areas without having to make an extended departure from civilization. Why can’t I have both—my nature and my nurture? Fortunately for me, almost a full third of the Appalachian Trail is in New England, so maybe I can have it all—because I think if there is one thing I’ve learned from Bryson’s experience, it is that I don’t have to suffer through long days of cold rain and hungry nights to enjoy what the Appalachian Trail has to offer."
2,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,4,"I kind of surprised I liked this book at all, because: a) I read pathetically little non-fiction b) I've never read a travelogue ANDc) I'm only a fan of the Great Outdoors as long as I'm safely Indoors.So, color me shocked that I not only finished this, but giggled my way through quite a bit of it! Bryson really is a pretty funny writer, and the way he captured his experience on the Appalachian Trail had me in tears a few times. His fears about getting mauled by a bear (among other things) before he started off were especially hysterical, and maybe that's because I could see a lot of myself in his initial terror of spending so much time surrounded by...NATURE!Now, there was a decent-sized chunk towards the middle of the book that I just had to grit my teeth and push on through. Bryson's friend Katz wasn't with him during this portion, and the difference in the tone of the writing is really noticeable. Lots and lots and lots of mind-numbing details about the Trail, and very little of his experiences. And while all of that sort of info is relevant to the book, it's also the main reason that I don't actively seek out non-fiction or travelogues. Eventually, Katz comes back to finish out the hike, and the story vastly improves, but it never managed to recapture the humor or spirit that it had in the beginning. But that's only MY opinion.And I really did enjoy the last bits of the book a lot. Especially the moments between Katz & Bryson there towards the end.Overall, I'd say this was a winner. And even if the whole thing wasn't to my liking, the first half was an easy 5 star read for me.In fact, it made me want to call up my BFF to see if she wanted to take the kids camping this summer so we could poop near a waterfall!You know, instead of meeting at a hotel on the beach and drinking ourselves silly while the kids play in the surf.And then I thought about that sentence.Bwahahahahahahaha!No. Just...no.See you in Florida, Jill! I'll bring the blender! "
3,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie,4,"I'm no city mouse. I'm a country mouse who lives in jeans and who often has a thick layer of soil under her nails from gardening. But, when compared to my brother, I feel like Beyoncé.My brother is like. . . Inman, from Cold Mountain. A man who walks and walks, all over Appalachia.He knows how to forage for food and how to identify what is good and what is bad, out in nature. I can point to anything within the plant kingdom, and he knows its name. He composts all of his own waste and leaves a very faint footprint on our planet.He's also. . . you know, a little crazy, when it comes to the whole walking thing.My brother has thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail once, in its entirety, and has section-hiked more than 900+ miles of favorite parts of it, at other times. He walks or hikes 5-25 miles a day, and he's currently on the Pacific Crest Trail, somewhere in Northern California, at the time of this writing.He's a walker, and even though I ALSO walk and hike, my habits apparently look like small potatoes to him. When he was here in May, at our house, preparing to head out to hike the PCT, he was nudging me, emphatically, to hike the Appalachian Trail soon.He was doing this nudging as all three of my kids were in the kitchen with me, and one of them was literally hanging on to my leg. Both dogs were starving, staring at me as we talked, our cats were walking in and out of the house, yowling for food, and my husband was outside, pulling weeds.I must have looked at him like he was an idiot. I sputtered out something in annoyance, like, “I have responsibilities. Maybe someday, like, when we're retired??” (And, maybe not then, either?)The compromise we reached was that, instead of starting the AT on that day, I would commit to reading Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods while he was out on the PCT. Fair enough. I finished it today.Here's what I have to say:I love Bill Bryson when he's funny, like when he's making social observations, or, in the case of this story, out hiking with his friend, Stephen Katz, and the hilarious commentary that ensues.I don't love Bill Bryson when he bores me to bits, breaking off from the funny story to describe geological phenomenons or maps or the National Park system in the United States. Be humorous OR be didactic, Bill, but please don't be both. I would never hike one of these trails without an entourage, bear spray, a billy club and/or a baseball bat and an INCREDIBLE SENSE OF HUMOR.After reading Bryson's book, I would like to hike at least part of the Appalachian Trail someday, if only to write about it. I believe that my desire to pepper spray any strange looking man on the trail, without a moment's hesitation, may make for some interesting writing. Plus, I'd be sure to scream at every snake, and I'd probably be stupid enough to play with a bear cub. They're so cute!Personally, I wanted to know a LOT more about these freaks in the shelter at night, and way more details on where and how they all went to the bathroom (shudder), and I felt completely let-down that Bryson and his companion hiked so little of the actual trail.Honestly, the book was so boring in the middle (when they gave up on the trail the first time), that I could barely summon the interest to read it again.I think I need to stop thinking of Bryson as a humorist, like Dave Barry. He does make me laugh, but he does drone on, too, about things that interest me not. I've reached a weird point with him, where I'm not sure I want to continue reading more.Four stars for some memorable descriptions of a few of the hikers and several hearty laughs. . . And fingers crossed for the safe return home of my brother!"
4,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,2,"I wanted to like Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. Not sure what I was expecting from this—perhaps more about hiking on the actual AT and the reasons Bryson made this trek—but I was mostly disappointed. It read like a series of travel brochures: here’s the history of the region on this section of the trail, and now another…There was much more attention devoted to towns along the route than hiking the actual trail. It was also disappointing that Bryson noted the historical stereotypes of Appalachian people and casually confirmed their stupidity without any real interaction (not once but many times). The smugness of his remarks was irritating. I still would like to hike the AT, but Bryson did little to illuminate what it’s really like to hike the trail except to offer that it’s not what most people expect. "
5,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,5,"Bill Bryson calls the Appalachian Trail ""the grandaddy of long hikes,"" but for me, this book is the granddaddy of hiking memoirs. I first read it sometime around 1999, and I enjoyed it so much that not only have I reread this multiple times, but it also inspired me to read at least a dozen other hiking adventures. None have matched Bryson's wit. Before he started writing long books on various aspects of history, Bryson was known for his entertaining travelogues. A Walk in the Woods was his humorous take on attempting a long-distance hike of the Appalachian Trail, which spans more than 2,100 miles from Georgia to Maine. Here were his reasons for trying:""It would get me fit after years of waddlesome sloth. It would be an interesting and reflective way to reacquaint myself with the scale and beauty of my native land after nearly twenty years of living abroad. It would be useful (I wasn't quite sure in what way, but I was sure nonetheless) to learn to fend for myself in the wilderness. When guys in camouflage pants and hunting hats sat around in the Four Aces Diner talking about fearsome things done out-of-doors, I would no longer have to feel like such a cupcake. I wanted a little of that swagger that comes with being able to gaze at a far horizon through eyes of chipped granite and say with a slow, manly sniff, 'Yeah, I've shit in the woods.'""And so Bryson plans his trip, gets indignant over the high cost of outdoor equipment, and recruits an old friend, Stephen Katz, to walk the trail with him. Katz, an overweight, out-of-shape, recovering alcoholic, adds much hilarity to the adventure. The first day on the trail, Katz falls behind and has a fit, throwing away a lot of supplies in an effort to lighten the load of his pack. Later he gets lost during a stretch when they were dangerously low on water. But he's so pathetic and funny that you forgive him.Meanwhile, Bryson was having his own problems that first day:""It was hell. First days on hiking trips always are. I was hopelessly out of shape -- hopelessly. The pack weighed way too much. Way too much. I had never encountered anything so hard, for which I was so ill prepared. Every step was a struggle. The hardest part was coming to terms with the constant dispiriting discovery that there is always more hill ... The elusive summit continually retreats by whatever distance you press forward, so that each time the canopy parts enough to give a view you are dismayed to see that the topmost trees are as remote, as unattainable, as before. Still you stagger on. What else can you do?""After a few days on the trail, they met another hiker named Mary Ellen, who leeched onto them. ""She was from Florida, and she was, as Katz forever after termed her in a special tone of awe, a piece of work. She talked nonstop, except when she was clearing out her eustachian tubes (which she did frequently) by pinching her nose and blowing out with a series of violent and alarming snorts of a sort that would make a dog leave the sofa and get under a table in the next room. I have long known that it is part of God's plan for me to spend a little time with each of the most stupid people on earth, and Mary Ellen was proof that even in the Appalachian woods I would not be spared.""I'm not going to retype entire pages, but trust me that the conversations with Mary Ellen are one of the highlights of this book. Bryson and Katz spend several weeks on the trail, hiking 500 miles in their first section. Then the two take a break and return home for a few weeks, and Bryson resumes with some shorter hikes in New England. Katz and Bryson reunite in Maine to hike a particularly daunting section of the trail called the Hundred Mile Wilderness:""The Appalachian Trail is the hardest thing I have ever done, and the Maine portion was the hardest part of the Appalachian Trail, and by a factor I couldn't begin to compute.""Exhausted, filthy and hungry, the two abandon their trek in Maine and hitchhike to a small town, where they're able to make their way home again. ""I have regrets, of course. I regret that I didn't do [Mount] Katahdin (though I will, I promise you, I will). I regret that I never saw a bear or wolf or followed the padding retreat of a giant hellbender salamander, never shooed away a bobcat or sidestepped a rattlesnake, never flushed a startled boar. I wish that just once I had truly stared death in the face (briefly, with a written assurance of survival). But I got a great deal else from the experience. I learned to pitch a tent and sleep beneath the stars. For a brief, proud period I was slender and fit. I gained a profound respect for wilderness and nature and the benign dark power of woods. I understand now, in a way I never did before, the colossal scale of the world. I found patience and fortitude that I didn't know I had. I had discovered an America that millions of people scarcely know exists ... Best of all, these days when I see a mountain, I look at it slowly and appraisingly, with a narrow, confident gaze and eyes of chipped granite.""One of the things I especially like about this book is the history that Bryson includes along the way. He shares interesting stories about the areas he's passing through and about how the trail was built. He also looks at America's unique relationship with nature, which includes some backwards policies of the U.S. Forest Service and the Parks Service. It's really a delight to read.This memoir has been criticized because Bryson doesn't hike the entire trail, but regardless of the distance, it's still a damn fine travelogue. This was his experience on the AT, which he shares with much humor and insight. I don't care that he hiked only 870 miles out of 2,100 -- the point was that he attempted it."
6,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1194517-mischenko,5,"Definitely read the book if you're a fan of the outdoors and hiking. I learned about the book after watching the movie, and let me say, the book to me was much better."
7,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Undoubtedly an amusing, breezy read, full of the kind of fun and hilarity all the blurbs lead you to expect. For instance, ""Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old."" That had me laughing on the train.I can't say I liked this book quite as much as some of my friends seem to. On the one hand, I've had at least 1 semi-grueling backpacking experience with a companion who was wholly unprepared for a rigorous day hike, let alone several of them on consecutive days, weighed down by tents, bags, and water, except my experience was less hilarious and more infuriating (even in retrospect, though there was certainly some hilarity). I also found Bryson fairly amusing, his fears and hijinks recognizable and diverting. On the other hand, he's kind of an ass. Seemed like every person he met was a subject for mockery. He also went off on these long jeremiads over the ecological devastation we've wrought on the Eastern forests, without citing any sources whatsoever, or recommending solutions. Obviously I agreed with the substance of those rants, but the dripping sarcasm in his indignation was just so annoying. Good researchers cite sources, and good crusaders at least try to find answers to the world's problems. Bryson seemed like more of a gadfly: buzzing, bothersome, but impotent. In the end, what I really wanted was just more depth. More analysis of what the trail means to Americans, what it symbolizes, a more informed (and documented) record of the Park Service's transgressions, more comparisons to similar trails in other parts of the world. "
8,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2861020-ben,1,"Bill Bryson is extremely annoying. I started out liking this book, but the further I went along, the more obnoxious I found the author's smarter-than-thou attitude. And that's a shame, too, because I was very interested in the subject matter and had the impression that Bryson wrote with a comedic edge. However, his sense of humor turns out to be quite bland, and consists mostly of making fun of everyone he meets. Get ready for adjectives like ""stupid"" and ""fat"" ... very high-brow. And don't worry, you'll hear the standard inbred jokes as he hikes through the South.Like hypocritical rants? You'll get plenty here; he eviscerates the National Park system, but that doesn't stop him from taking full advantage of all its amenities. He rips tourists who just stop by the AT to do quick hikes, eat cheeseburgers at fast-food restaurants, then hop in their cars and move on, and yet he spends much of the middle section of the book doing just that! He also rips unprepared hikers who don't know what they're doing ... much like the time later in the book when he leaves his windbreaker at home while hiking in the Presidentials; also, he sets out to hike the entire length of the AT, but gives up when he looks at a map in Gatlinburg and realizes -gasp- the AT is really long! Seriously? You didn't look at a map BEFORE you started hiking? Needless to say, he gave up immediately.Not that there's anything wrong with giving up. I guess this writer's just not for me - he comes across as having a little more disdain for the rest of the world than he has a right to."
9,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads,4,"Well, scratch the Appalachian Trail off my bucketlist. Bryson sets off to walk the Appalachian trail with only an extremely overpriced backpack (packed with equally ridiculously expensive gear), an old ""friend""  that he hadn't talked to in years and a will to find his next story. He quickly realized that the months of preparation he conducted (and the lack of months his friend prepared) were not nearly adequate. But on the plus side, he certainly found his story.As always, I absolutely enjoyed his signature sense of humor. Despite wandering around half crazed with fatigue, he still took the time to pen his quirky musings:
Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old.
Joking aside, this is a brutal trail (no matter what Cheryl from Wild may say. Her little pot-shots against The Appalachian Trail were not justified). The sheer willpower it takes to slog through ten to twenty trail miles a day simply boggles my mind. 
Distance changes utterly when you take the world on foot. A mile becomes a long way, two miles literally considerable, ten miles whopping, fifty miles at the very limits of conception.
I was weary just reading it - and he already most of the monotonous bits from his story. I appreciate how reading this allowed me to adventure vicariously and decide (most definitely) that I will never hike such a trail. Even part of it. 
I'm not touching that thing with a ten-foot pole
I'll stick to my wood-chipped half-mile paths in the local park, thank you very much.Audiobook Comments---Am a smidge annoyed that he did not narrate his own autobiography (well micro-autobiography of a trail adventure (are micro-autos a thing?))---Narrator (Rob McQuay) was great though. No complaints other than it wasn't Bryson.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!"
10,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49365462-w,5,"Travel writing does not get any better or any funnier than this. This is Bill Bryson at his very best,side splittingly funny.Bill Bryson sets out with his friend Katz to hike the Appalachian trail. The trail is picturesque,but for two men in their forties,it is still hard work.As he always does,Bryson digs up a whole lot of background detail and trivia about the trail. It's first rate entertainment. Katz may not be the ideal hiking companion but provides plenty of humour.There are lively encounters with fellow hikers along the way and even some disconcerting ones with wildlife. The trail can be dangerous too,as shown by the murder of some hikers in the past.Bryson's subsequent travel books would not necessarily maintain this quality. This book would later become a movie in 2015,with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte playing Bryson and Katz. But I doubt if the movie could do justice to the sheer comic brilliance of the book."
11,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff,5,"Going into this book, I really had no idea of what to expect from Bill Bryson. Even though I picked this book up based on Diane’s terrific review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), I had never read the author before and let’s face it - blurbs on the cover only tell you so much. You have to read and live with an author’s prose to get a feel for it. As far as travelogues go, I don’t read many: Paul Theroux, Mark Twain and Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley are the only ones that come to mind. So I plunged in and I’m happy I did.Finding a rich source of humor (Monty Python, Archer, S.J. Pearlman, Deadpool) is always like Christmas Day. For me, humor has always been the fuel to motor through tough times and Mr. Bryson delivers it by the tank full. This book has a score of laugh out loud moments all weaved into Bryson’s cultural and historical insights.Bryson lived abroad for years and upon returning to the United States decided to hike the Appalachian Trail. The trail is over 2000 miles long and extends from Georgia into Maine. Along the way, Bryson discourses on subjects that range from the history of the Appalachian Trail, the neglect and incompetence of the Forestry and Park services, pre-Colonial botanists, the potential flame ball that is Centralia, PA, the temperature extremes of Mount Washington (NH), trees, the constant threat of getting eaten by bears or hogtied by hillbillies and, of course, the hike itself. The long, long hike.My experience with hiking and outdoorsy stuff begins and ends with the Boy Scouts. For me, it was about smoking cigarettes in the woods, being able to indiscriminately pee on the local flora, fauna and the occasional fellow scout (the latter, accidently, of course) wearing the same clothes and not bathing for three days. “You packed extra underwear and socks, Ma? I hadn’t noticed.” “The tooth brush is green because I dropped it in the creek. Don’t worry, I used it anyway.”If I were to go hiking today, I don’t think I would have picked the guy Bryson ended up with. Stephen Katz was overweight, needy, impetuous but funny. Kind of like hiking with my brother-in-law, minus the funny. The two are an unrivaled comic pair and their hiking adventures are a highly recommended read."
12,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail pressed all my favorite buttons: Humor. Adventure. Danger. Storytelling. Nature. Local/personal interest. Et cetera.I even liked that the author Bill Bryson is a American-Brit ex-pat/transplant and thus an outsider giving his opinion as a stranger in a strange land. Bryson's humorous, well-researched, yet relaxed writing is what I always hope for when embarking upon a book like this.A trek upon the Appalachian Trail is supposed to be relaxing, if strenuous, and if a bit of history and humor get mixed in then all the better. For those like myself who grew up in New England, the lure and legend of the trail was spoon-fed us from an early age, right along with Johnny Appleseed and the ride of Paul Revere. Those of us too lazy to make the actual hike can sit back and read Bryson's book while thinking about how swell a jaunt would be.                While I enjoyed hearing about the local spots I'm familiar with like Mt. Washington in New Hampshire (a hiker from Pepperell, MA the tiny town my mom is from is even mentioned, woohoo!), it's Bryson's relationship with his friend Katz, a larger-than-life character who joined him periodically on the trail, that really ties this whole book together. The hijinks are raised when Katz enters the scene, making a normal hike in the woods into an adventure, perhaps more than it needed to be, but I'm grateful either way!Bryson's writing and the personality that comes through made more palatable his occasional soapbox tangents. The guy loves nature preservation and he's not happy when man fucks with it, so every once in a while the reader must wade through a lecture on why the trail is essentially lucky to be alive. For all that, I loved this book just about in its entirety and look forward to reading more by Bill Bryson, a writer who I've taken an immediate shine to, a reader-writer bond strengthened by my own private pleasure at discovering we share December 8th as a birthday."

After reading A Man Called Ove last week, I was afraid nothing would compare and I’d be stuck in book hangover mode unless I picked something totally different from what I normally read. I decided to go to the library website incognito in order to not get the typical porny recommendations made “just for me” and get the generally recommended ones instead. Obviously A Walk In The Woods was a book that appeared on the list and I remembered way back when I was thinking about reading Wild a certain Georgia peach said I should read this instead because at least if I hated it she was almost certain I’d at least get a couple of laughs. And she was correct. Right from the start Bryson declares . . . 
I wanted a little of that swagger that comes with being able to gaze at a far horizon through eyes of chipped granite and say with a slow, manly sniff, “Yeah, I’ve shit in the woods.”
I pretty much decided right at that point the author was probably my people. To begin with he described his state of living as 
“waddlesome sloth,”
 which is a lifestyle I support 110%. He followed that up with a shopping trip to buy necessities such as 
“a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies.” 
 And then he sealed the deal by taking his old friend Katz along for the hike . . . .
“Jesus, I smell like Jeffrey Dahmer’s refrigerator.” 
In case the above didn’t clue you in, Katz isn’t exactly what you’d call politically correct. You’ve been warned so don’t come crying to me about what a disgusting manbearpig he was. Here’s another tidbit at what my new best friend Katz brings to the table . . . .
Good lord, look at you! What have you been doing? You’re filthy. You haven’t been screwing hogs again, have you, Bryson? . . . They’re not clean animals, you know, no matter how attractive they may look after a month on the trail. And don’t forget we’re not in Tennessee anymore. It’s probably not even legal here – at least without a note from the vet. . . . Come sit down and tell me all about it. So what was here name – Bossy? Did she squeal a lot?
These two were a hoot. A regular Odd Couple taking the reader on a potential life-threatening comedy of errors. From freak snowstorms to uninvited tag-alongs on their journey.(SIDENOTE: Apparently the role of the uber annoying Mary Ellen is played by none other than the lady who voices this delightful little lady in the movie version . . . . 

While Ms. Schaal makes for quite the entertaining cartoon voice I have a feeling I’d want to stab the non-animated version should we ever meet. /ENDSIDENOTE)To a possible bear attack that had me casting John Candy in the role of Bill Bryson due to this fond memory . . . . 

The only reason this gets 4 Stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that . . . 

While it’s obvious that Bryson fell in love with The Appalachian Trail on his journey, there is a lot of info dumping that occurs because of this love. The history of national parks/the Army Corps of Engineers/the forestry industry as well a detailed inventory of flora and fauna and random tidbits and “fun” (in a macabre sense of the term) facts regarding different locations along the trail sometimes left my mind wandering.That being said, A Walk In The Woods is an adventure I won’t soon forget. I didn't know until this weekend that there’s a film version. I hope to check it out soon because . . . . 

Nick Nolte was more than a bit too old for the role, but still might end up being the  perfect choice for Katz!"
14,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,2,"When I chose this book I failed to understand the author’s intention. Look at the subtitle! I hadn't noted the words ""Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail"". This book is not for people who love hiking; it is not intended to increase love of the sport. It scarcely shows the pleasure one can derive from hiking. It is instead a commentary on America with some details about the Appalachian Trail. I have to admit my own fault in not carefully reading the complete title. I still must rate according to my own appreciation of the book. For me it was just OK.This book is full of griping and whining. From its start to almost the very end. At the end there is a line or two that shows appreciation for hiking. For the purpose of delivering an exciting tale the author begins by listing all the terrible things that can happen and have happened on the trail. Bryson warns of getting lost, being bitten by snakes, eaten by bears, mauled by mountain lions and even being murdered. The complaining doesn't stop there. He tells of unpleasant people on the trail, the weight of the pack, hunger and tiredness, the expense and idiocy of trekking gear, even abstinence from sex and family and TV and soda pop and Little Debbie cakes and beer. He goes on to bemoan pollution, park authorities, deficient maps, modern American urbanization and expansion of roads to the point where one is unable to w-a-l-k by foot anywhere. Sure, some of the gripes certainly are legitimate, but a whole book of griping is hard to take, and the focus is scarcely on the delight of hiking. I love hiking. Beware, by no means does the author and his buddy Stephen Katz travel the whole trail. Do not expect a complete trail guide. They trek 500 miles, starting at the southern end, and then stop for a break, totally worn out by their experiences. They each go home, but Bryson then decides to cover portions of the trail by making day trips using his car. At this point the topics covered shift from trail experiences to information about historical events that have occurred at various places near the trail. The book sidetracks to cover events of the Civil War (Stonewall Jackson and Harper's Ferry), oil and anthracite mining, the smoking, inextinguishable underground mine fires of Centralia, Pennsylvania, as well as the ecological devastation at abandoned zinc mines at Palmerton in the same state. I name but a few examples. After Bryson’s solitary day excursions by car the two buddies meet up again to trek in Maine, finishing off with the “100 Mile Wilderness”. Well, I will not tell you what happens there, but you can pretty much guess. Anyone who knows anything about longer hiking tours knows that planning and careful preparation are essential. This includes critically assessing one’s own capabilities. Who says one has to trek the whole trail anyway? They finally realize that! Pseudonyms are used to protect the identity of those spoken of. Stephen Katz is a pseudonym too. When you read the book you will not be surprised at the need to cover up true identities. Many extremely uncomplimentary things are said. There are some humorous lines. There are some interesting historical details about the trail. There are some relevant insights about trekking which can be drawn from the book if you ponder what happens:-the first and second day are always the hardest.-it is easy to get lost.-don’t walk alone and inform others of your itinerary. -plan carefully water availability.-have proper clothing; weather can radically change.-take only what you really need. Every ounce feels like a ton when it is on your back. After a trek you will feel as though you are flying. After a trek you will appreciate the wonder of a warm shower and cleanliness. After a trek you will appreciate what before you have taken for granted – the ease of walking without gear, cooked food, being clean, and the beauty of nature. I wish this book had much more emphasis on what trekking can give a person. The audiobook is narrated by Rob McQuay. He does a fine job. Easy to follow and at a good clip. He expresses through his intonation both the lines of humor and the author’s criticism of modern American trends. The disdain is heard. **************************After 9 chapters:I am not exactly enjoying this, even if there are a few amusing lines. So much complaining. Such poor planning. And tell me why is there so little about the beauty of nature? The point with hiking is not to partake in a race or a competition to determine who does it fastest, in one swipe or in parts. Why would anyone have to do the-whole-thing? That is not the point. I prefer the empty Swedish mountain ranges.But I haven't given up on the book."
15,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87898-jack,5,"Imagine a grueling, four-month wilderness trek along the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Your guide: an intellectual, who lived half his life in England, well versed in geology, zoology, ecology and pretty much all of the other ‘ologies.’ Yet, this far from ordinary guide summons the sparkle of Twain, and of Billy Crystal. Picture all of this for a sense of what can be found inside the covers of Bill Bryson’s ""A Walk in the Woods."" Bryson, a self-deprecating intellectual of the first order, provides massive helpings of horse-laughing humor that are pleasantly painful to read. The compulsion to read aloud ""Walk’s"" funnier passages to friends and family overwhelms, as does the desire to pass the book on to others after the warmth of the last page flickers. Bryson grew up in Iowa. While in his twenties, he moved to England where he spent 20 years writing for British and American publications. In 1996 he and his family returned to the United States, settling in New Hampshire. One day, he “happened on a path that vanished into the wood on the edge of town.” That path was a tiny segment of the Appalachian Trail: a continuous 2,100-mile, mostly-wilderness trail along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains. Intrigued, Bryson thought, what better way to reacquaint himself with his native land, and at the same time: “It would get me fit after years of waddlesome sloth."" After thorough research, Bryson determines his undertaking would be difficult, requiring a companion. Exhausting all of his best choices, Bryson settles on Steve Katz, an old high school buddy. Katz, an overweight and out of shape, X - Files addicted, Snicker munching, surprisingly fetching sidekick becomes the focal point of much of Walk’s hilarity and pathos.A number of unforgettable characters pop up along the trail. Most memorable is the gratingly obnoxious Mary Ellen, who after she had tagged along for several days, Bryson and Katz ditch using an elaborate deception. “She was, as Katz forever termed her in a special tone of awe, a piece of work."" They encounter Bob, the world’s foremost authority on everything. Bryson and Katz spend several days with the delightful John Connolly, a New York schoolteacher who had been hiking the trail a bit at a time for 19 years. One night the three camp with seventeen Boy Scouts and three adult supervisors, “all charmingly incompetent.” After watching a night of the scout’s ineptness: “Even Katz agreed that this was better than TV.""Along the way, Bryson painlessly inserts lessons of history, geology, entomology, and more. We learn about the changes acid rain has brought to the wild, and he recounts the stories of the southern pine beetle, the smoky madtom and wooly adelgids, and about Daniel Boone, Henry David Thoreau and Stonewall Jackson. Bryson delivers an extended geology lesson on the tectonic formation of the 470 million year-old Appalachian Mountains that palatably educates. While praising some of their employees, Bryson effectively and mercilessly bashes the U.S. Forest Service (road builders for the logging industry – “eight times the total mileage of America’s interstate highway system,"" the National Park Service (“actually has something of a tradition of making things extinct""), and the Army Corps of Engineers (“they don’t build things very well"").  Bryson makes his environmental bent abundantly clear. But, his lessons rarely become preachy. They reflect the all too human predisposition to seek the easy way, the momentary thrill, and always at a cost. Without accusation, Bryson reminds us of those often easy to ignore environmental costs. Bill Bryson’s ""A Walk in the Woods"" lovingly opens a window to “an America that millions of people scarcely know exists.” There are problems to solve along this great, mountain forest trail. Yet, the air intoxicates. The sights are unforgetable. And the smile remains"
16,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"In ""A Walk in the Woods"", Bryson narrates his experiences on the Appalachian Trail which stretches 2000+ miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, passing through eleven states and populated with all kinds of peril imaginable. As Bryson saysThe woods were full of peril - rattlesnakes and water moccasins and nests of copperheads; bobcat, bears, coyotes, wolves, and wild boar; loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex; merciless fire ants and ravening blackfly; poison ivy, poison sumac, poison salamanders; even a scattering of moose lethally deranged by a parasitic worm that burrows a nest in their brains and befuddles them into chasing hapless hikers through remote, sunny meadows and into glacial lakes.Of course he's exaggerating... but it's the kind of exaggeration one nervously indulges in to mask one's apprehension, the reader feels. And combined the trials of the trail, the fact that Bryson is supremely unfit to do any kind of extended strenuous activity, does not know the first thing about hiking, and is accompanied by the recovering alcoholic Stephen Katz who is even less fit does nothing to alleviate his apprehensions.He sets of gamely, however - and what we get is a travelogue-cum-science-cum-history-cum-geography lesson. It is fascinating.What I love about Bill Bryson is the casual way in which he feeds you nuggets of information: history, geography, science and whatnot. He packages them in digestible chunks in between personal anecdotes sprinkled with humorous observations, so that subjects which by right should be boring, become exciting.The first part of the hike from Springer Mountain in Georgia to the town of Front Royal in Virginia, was completed in one stretch by Bryson and Katz, with motorised breaks in between - for not being professional hikers, walking through was a virtual impossibility for them. This part is extremely amusing, some parts being worthy of Wodehouse himself. The idiosyncrasies of various hikers, the sorry condition of the night shelters, and the colourful personality of Katz (who manages to fall afoul of the irate husband of a lady he propositions, even in the midst of hiking, believe it or not!) - all make for engrossing reading. The second part is completed by Bryson in bits and pieces until the very last bit in Maine, where he is rejoined by Katz (and they end up in dropping out halfway, after Katz manages to lose himself in the woods for a brief interval - a scary episode). It is here that we are treated to the fascinating history of the trail. The story of Centralia, a once thriving mining community in Pennsylvania now degraded to ghost town status, due to a coal fire in the underground mine started in 1962 and still burning, slowly eating away the town, is especially rivetting and disturbing. Bryson does not hide his ire at the authorities for America's disappearing woodlands, as well as his contempt for a populace addicted to the transient pleasures of instant sensual gratification.It was a thoroughly enjoyable read to finish the year off. I will be reading more of Bryson in the future."
17,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46000051-piratesteve,5, I chose this book in hopes it would rekindle my appetite for hiking. The book easily did that. I also found this to be such a pleasurable read. I looked forward at every stolen opportunity to read another chapter. It delivered each time.
18,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/303446-dylan,5,"I have read most of Bill Bryson's books and they are all good-- excellent even. His gift is in his ability to detect the humor in any situation. Where you or I might see a man walking down the street he sees something, and articulates it so well, packed with humor. But this book is his best. The reason, I think, is that it takes him out of his element. His natural writing style is this so-called ""travel writing"" genre-- the idea that someone goes somewhere and writes about it and their time there. But most ""travel writers"" don't hike over half of the AT, that's unheard of. And the fact that Bryson at middle age decided to take on such a task with no real background in backpacking, let alone for months at a time, is downright impressive. So the premise of the book is already good before you even start reading. Then the book just blows you away. The man can describe nature with the best of them but his expertise is in describing human interactions. And, perhaps, that's why he chose the AT. There are indeed some interesting people who decide to take the plunge and walk the trail from end to end. Among them are Stephen Katz, Bryson's sidekick from earlier adventures in France, who is now overweight and obsessed with junk food-- admittedly Katz gives Bryson ample material to work with. Then there is the woman who hikes with them and camps with them for a few weeks. She acts as though they are the problem, forcing the partnership on her as it were, but we quickly discover that her own insecurities are at the root of her behavior. Bryson navigates her personality in a delicate but oh so funny way. Whether you hike or not, laugh or not, enjoy Bryson or not you should read this it will change your mind or affirm what you already knew-- Bryson is the best at what he does."
19,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,4,"Let me just get this out of the way first: Sorry, Trish! I couldn't help myself! I have no willpower! I am officially the world's worst buddy reader!Right, as for the book... I enjoyed it. The only Bryson I've read before this was his book about hiking in my native UK and, perhaps because this book deals with territory I'm a lot less familiar with, I preferred this one. I enjoyed Bryson's wry, despairing sense of humour. I enjoyed his interactions with his walking-buddy, Katz (not sure of the spelling; I listened to the audiobook) who was both hilariously annoying and quite sweet on occasion. I enjoyed Bryson's many educational tangents into the history of the area they were currently walking through.Why only four stars then? Well, there isn't really anything wrong with the book that I can exactly put my finger on, but I just didn't enjoy it quite enough to warrant the full five stars. I wish I could tell you why; I just can't quite bring myself to give it five out of five. Maybe some of the people they encounter are just a little too irritating to be thoroughly enjoyable. Maybe some of the historical tangents are just a little too tangential. Maybe I'm just an arse.Despite this, I certainly enjoyed it enough to read more Bryson in the future. (That's kind of redundant isn't it? It's not like I can read more Bryson in the past...)"
20,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17420799-olive-fellows-abookolive,4,I discussed this book and its movie adaptation over on Booktube: https://youtu.be/FhH1h1MKYuI
21,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books,2,"This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.I am terribly disappointed by the fact that I did not fall in love with this book. When I was choosing a book to read, I took one look at the ratings for this book on Goodreads and knew that I had to read this book right away. Seriously, every single one of my friends on Goodreads gave this book either a 4 or 5 star rating. And they said it was funny. I love funny. I knew that I would just love this book.I didn't love it. I was actually bored for most of this book. I do admit that this isn't the kind of book that I usually read but a humorous non-fiction story about hiking the Appalachian Trail sounded fabulous. I really did enjoy the parts of the book that focused on Bill and Stephen's adventures on the trail. I just wish that the focus of the book would have stayed with Bill and Stephen.The problem was that there was just too much other stuff crammed into this book. I sometimes felt like I was reading a textbook....a well-written textbook...but a textbook nonetheless. In this short little book, I learned about the history of the Appalachian Trail, some geology, information about bears, trees, the National Park Service, birds, and various other things. A lot of the time the book just felt dry and information packed. I was glad that some of this information was shared in a fun way that actually put a smile on my face. All too often, I felt like skipping entire sections of the book so that I could get back to the actual hike.I had hoped that this was going to be one of those side splitting funny kind of books. It had its moments of humor but nothing that made me do anything more than crack a smile. There was no laughing out loud and the parts that were funny seemed to be rather sparse. Don't get me wrong, I can tell that Bill Bryson is a very funny guy but I need a lot more of those kind of moments to offset the parts of the book that were dry. I did notice that there is a movie based on this book that is soon to be released. I actually am looking forward to that movie because I suspect that it will focus on the parts of the book that I really enjoyed....the actual hike. I don't think that there will be too many geology or history lessons found in the film. I am thinking that I actually want to go an see the movie when it comes out and I never go see movies.I am not going to be recommending this book but I am seriously in the minority with this one. I would tell readers to pick it up if it sounds interesting to you. You may be one of the many who really love it. I still really wish that I was one of the many readers who love it. I received an advance reader edition of this book from Blogging for Books for the purpose of providing an honest review."
22,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72137025-j-k-grice,5,"Pure Bryson delight, as well as an informative history about the Appalachian Trail. Although I could never imagine Robert Redford portraying Bill Bryson, the film version is pretty funny, with Nick Nolte adding great comic relief. Highly recommended."
23,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,4,"I really enjoyed A Walk in the Woods, the first book I've read by Bill Bryson. I enjoyed Part 1, where Katz was Bryson's trail companion, more than Part 2 but still liked all of it. The book has a very good balance of story, humor (including plenty of sarcasm), and Appalachian Trail history and information. Hiking the AT (or anything similar really) is something I more than likely would never do. I am a day-nature-r, enjoying outdoorsy activities for the day, usually one day at a time, and if anything, am more of a Glamper than a Camper. While there are plenty of differences, Into the Wild and Wild are among some of my all-time favorite books, and I'm not surprised I really enjoyed this one too. Perhaps well-written books where the premise is nature-based are enjoyable for me because they're an escape - imagining the immersion in nature while not having to actually participate in the rigorous, physical demands involved in undertaking such a challenge."
24,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"I love Bill Bryson's books, and this one is no exception. Bryson tells the story of his hiking up the Appalachian Trail (AT for short) with his friend, Stephen Katz. His friend is quite a character, and I sort of wonder if he is a real person, or if he is ""invented"". But--Katz is such a wonderful character, he is probably real, because ""inventing"" him would be nearly impossible. He is a recovering alcoholic, overweight sort of slob who throws out his irreplaceable supplies when the going gets tough. It seemed like a disaster in the making, but somehow Bryson and Katz survived.Bryson's prose is just a delight. He interleaves humorous anecdotes with tangents about history, the environment, bears, wildlife, and other interesting tidbits. The AT is not a simple ""walk in the woods""--it is at times demanding, challenging, and very time consuming. It can take a great deal of preparation before setting off, and is definitely not for the weak-hearted. If nothing else, this book persuaded me not to try to hike the AT. But--I love the stories that Bryson tells along the way.I didn't read this book--I listened to it as an audiobook. Rob McQuay does a great job narrating, and I look forward to listening to other books that are read by him. "
25,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char,3," A WALK IN THE WOODS was just okay. The author and his friend did not get to hike the entire trail as they had originally intended, which was not only disappointing for them, but for me as well.  I learned about the history of the trail and how the whole thing works. I previously had no idea that the trail sometimes crosses roads and rivers and whatnot-I had this picture of a pristine wilderness in my head and while some parts are just that, others are not. I thought there would be a bit more humor than there actually was and on top of that, there were no actual bears, (see him on the cover there?), unless you count the night something was heard just outside of their tent. Overall this was fun and I learned some things, so 3 stars it is.Thanks to my local library for the loan of this audiobook. Libraries RULE!"
26,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"Sometimes I wonder if I have been too judgemental with a book, I returned and reread a good chunk of this and feel if anything I was too generous. The problem I feel is that Bryson's humour is all about people. The odd people he meets and the funny things they say. On a footpath, in a forest, there are not many people and the interactions between Bryson and his sidekick Katz don't carry the weight of my expectations. The other ingredient in Bryson's style is a general attitude that the world is going to hell in a hand cart, and that cart has a wobbly wheel, which squeaks. This mindset qualified him to become the head person at the Campaign for the Preservation for Rural England, in this book it is evident in his belief that everybody has done everything wrong. So if it is not bad enough that logging is allowed in US national parks, to add insult to injury that logging is inefficient and loss making. If the Parks service leave an area to allow nature to do what it wills, that is wrong too. I had the feeling that for him Nature was perfect in, perhaps 1937 (view spoiler)[ or some other year (hide spoiler)] and the efforts of all right thinking public organisations should be directed to keeping things exactly as they were in 1937.At this time in his life Bryson was irregularly uprooting himself and family from England to the USA and then from the USA to England, England at times was plainly too English for him while the USA seemingly has a majority population of overweight car obsessed people who can barely stagger a half mile on foot, many of whom are also irredeemably stupid and inbred. Having said that whenever he stumbles across a hostelry he gorges himself on grease burgers and makes off with multi litre bottles of fizzy pop. He admits while walking to generally zoning out and not being aware of the landscape which apparently is largely all the same for him (view spoiler)[ some might regard that as a slight disadvantage for someone writing a book about a long distance walking trail (hide spoiler)]. I feel that Bryson's vision of his fellow Americans is largely a mirror image of himself(view spoiler)[ and viewed too close he finds the reflection horrible, back on the other side of the Atlantic it is, to mangle popular sayings, enticingly greener  (hide spoiler)], an intellectual butterfly that prefers to flitter than to seriously engage with anything and so with regard to the management of the National Parks I note that ecology is hard, mismanagement from one perspective or another near inevitable.Overwhelmingly I felt he would have preferred to have been walking in England - start the day in a pub, finish in a pub, unless unlucky lunch in a pub too, a rich collection of charming eccentrics on the footpaths admiring a landscape which by US standards would be dreary with nothing wilder than some sheep in sight.This a deeply, thoroughly and utterly ok kind of book, completely middle of the road. It's readable, moderately humorous and slightly informative and if you never read it your life will be no poorer.Bryson, writing this book doesn't know the Appalachian trail as somebody who has walked it a few times, or short stretches regularly might, or even somebody who has lived alongside it might. Nor from his text did I believe he had much knowledge of long distance walking. So I'm not sure that I can take his praise or criticisms of the route, its management or those who use it seriously. More to the point having read it, I don't feel an urge to explore it myself which is about the worst thing I can say about a book of this nature."
27,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid,5,It's the longest armchair hike I've ever taken and I've enjoyed every minute of it. I know I will never do this for real so this is next best. I enjoyed reading about the history of the AT and all the other stories that BB included in the report of his adventures.
28,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38544962-guy-austin,4,"This is a book I had always thought to read, but never had. I am very pleased that I finally got round to it. If you’re wanting something funny and absorbing for the flight home, to sit on the patio with a cup of coffee, or you’re your favorite chair staring out the window you have found it in A Walk in the Woods. I’m intrigued by stories of people who take to challenging adventures… I'll never be one of them. Bill Bryson and Katz kept me laughing and entertained for hours. I latterly was laugh crying at points and my wife walked in and asked what the heck I was reading. I know people say this from time to time as in an internal chuckle. No this was literal. Laughing so hard tears came forward and I could not go on reading as the pages were blurred by my tears. Mary Ellen was one of my favorite parts – I won’t spoil it. Bryson and Katz spend several weeks on the trail, hiking 500 miles in their first section. Then the two take a break and return home for a few weeks, and Bryson resumes with some shorter hikes in New England. Katz and Bryson reunite in Maine to hike a particularly daunting section of the trail called the Hundred Mile Wilderness. The first 500 Miles hold the best part of the book. The back half was good, but without Katz it was feeling a bit light and he returns for the hundred Mile Wilderness. Sewn within the narratives are many stories and back stories of town’s histories, trail history and environmental issues of both. I never felt I was being preached at. I loved those parts of it as well. You laugh, you learn, you walk away in a better frame of mind. If you’re looking to escape a little, I recommend this highly. "

31,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
32,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
33,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."

The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."

It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
37,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
38,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
39,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
40,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
41,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
42,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
43,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
45,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
46,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
47,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
48,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
49,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
50,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
51,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
52,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
53,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
54,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
55,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
56,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
58,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
59,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
60,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
61,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
62,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
63,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."
65,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/692133-julian-worker,4,"I rated this at 7/10 in terms of his other books. It's not his best, but it's better than most other books in this genre. The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."
66,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93380789-martin,5,"Facing savage weather, merciless insects, unreliable maps and a fickle companion whose profoundest wish was to go to a motel and watch The X-Files, Bryson gamely struggled through the wilderness of the Appalachian Trail to achieve a lifetime's ambition - not to die outdoors.I'll just get some hiking equipmentI ended up with enough equipment to bring ful employment to a vale of sherpas--a three-season tent, self-inflating sleeping pad, nested pots and pans, collapsible eating utensils, plastic dish and cup, complicated pump-action water purifier, stuff sacks in a rainbow of colors, seam sealer, patching kit, sleeping bag, bungee cords, water bottles, waterproof poncho, waterproof matches, pack cover, a rather nifty compass/thermometer keyring, a little collapsible stove that looked frankly like trouble, gas bottle and spare gas bottle, a hands-free flashlight that you wore on your head like a miner's lamp (this I liked very much), a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies, insulated long Johns and undershirts, four bandannas, and lots of other stuff, for some of which I had to go back again and ask what it was for exactly.Asking for a travel companionThen one day in late February, with departure nigh, I got a call. It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
67,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
68,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
69,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
70,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
71,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
72,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
73,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "

Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time.

77,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
78,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
79,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
80,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
81,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
82,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
83,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
84,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
85,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
86,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits.

Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
89,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
90,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
91,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
92,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
93,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."

It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
97,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""

I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
99,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
100,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
101,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
102,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
103,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."
104,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598503-michael,4,"I know the amount of reviews I'm promising to write are really stacking up, but I will try to get to writing full comments soon. I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
105,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
106,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
107,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
108,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
109,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
110,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
111,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
112,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
113,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
114,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
115,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
116,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

119,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
120,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
121,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
122,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
123,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."
125,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/692133-julian-worker,4,"I rated this at 7/10 in terms of his other books. It's not his best, but it's better than most other books in this genre. The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."
126,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93380789-martin,5,"Facing savage weather, merciless insects, unreliable maps and a fickle companion whose profoundest wish was to go to a motel and watch The X-Files, Bryson gamely struggled through the wilderness of the Appalachian Trail to achieve a lifetime's ambition - not to die outdoors.I'll just get some hiking equipmentI ended up with enough equipment to bring ful employment to a vale of sherpas--a three-season tent, self-inflating sleeping pad, nested pots and pans, collapsible eating utensils, plastic dish and cup, complicated pump-action water purifier, stuff sacks in a rainbow of colors, seam sealer, patching kit, sleeping bag, bungee cords, water bottles, waterproof poncho, waterproof matches, pack cover, a rather nifty compass/thermometer keyring, a little collapsible stove that looked frankly like trouble, gas bottle and spare gas bottle, a hands-free flashlight that you wore on your head like a miner's lamp (this I liked very much), a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies, insulated long Johns and undershirts, four bandannas, and lots of other stuff, for some of which I had to go back again and ask what it was for exactly.Asking for a travel companionThen one day in late February, with departure nigh, I got a call. It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
127,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
128,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
129,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
130,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
131,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
132,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
133,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
135,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
136,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
137,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
138,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
139,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
140,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
141,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
142,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
143,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
144,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
145,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
146,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
148,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
149,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
150,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
151,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
152,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
153,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."

It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
157,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""

I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail.

I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
161,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
162,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
163,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
165,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
166,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
167,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
168,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
169,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
170,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
171,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
172,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
173,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
174,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
175,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
176,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "

Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
179,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
180,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
181,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
182,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
183,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."

The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."

It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
187,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
188,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
189,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
190,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
191,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
192,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
193,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
195,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
196,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
197,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
198,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
199,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
200,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
201,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
202,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "

The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
204,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
205,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
206,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."
207,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4881152-me,4,"Follow the Appalachian Trail with Bill Bryson as he and an acquaintance from his past attempt to hike the entire 2,100 or so miles. The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
208,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
209,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
210,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
211,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
212,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
213,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."
215,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/692133-julian-worker,4,"I rated this at 7/10 in terms of his other books. It's not his best, but it's better than most other books in this genre. The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."
216,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93380789-martin,5,"Facing savage weather, merciless insects, unreliable maps and a fickle companion whose profoundest wish was to go to a motel and watch The X-Files, Bryson gamely struggled through the wilderness of the Appalachian Trail to achieve a lifetime's ambition - not to die outdoors.I'll just get some hiking equipmentI ended up with enough equipment to bring ful employment to a vale of sherpas--a three-season tent, self-inflating sleeping pad, nested pots and pans, collapsible eating utensils, plastic dish and cup, complicated pump-action water purifier, stuff sacks in a rainbow of colors, seam sealer, patching kit, sleeping bag, bungee cords, water bottles, waterproof poncho, waterproof matches, pack cover, a rather nifty compass/thermometer keyring, a little collapsible stove that looked frankly like trouble, gas bottle and spare gas bottle, a hands-free flashlight that you wore on your head like a miner's lamp (this I liked very much), a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies, insulated long Johns and undershirts, four bandannas, and lots of other stuff, for some of which I had to go back again and ask what it was for exactly.Asking for a travel companionThen one day in late February, with departure nigh, I got a call. It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
217,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
218,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
219,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
220,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
221,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
222,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
223,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
225,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "

Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
227,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
228,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
229,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
230,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
231,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
232,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
233,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
234,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
235,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
236,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
238,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
239,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
240,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
241,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
242,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
243,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."

It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
247,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""

I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
249,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
250,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
251,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
252,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
253,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."
255,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed,5,"When I was in the Boy Scouts, we hiked during several summers on the Appalachian Trail maybe for 200 miles or more. At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "
256,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17212630-derek,5,"Very entertaining so far!Finally done! This was delightful to read. Bryson has a great sense of humor, and his view of the world is inviting and engaging. I took about six.months to read it because I read it only at bedtime and only a few pages at a time. I look forward to reading more by Bryson. Notes from a Small Island and Neither Here Nor There look the most promising."
257,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32446295-somethingsnotright,5,I adore Bill Bryson and this is one of the laugh-out-loud funniest books I have ever read. I never tire of reading it. Pure bliss.
258,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"I delayed for so long reading a Bryson's book. I got to it just because I decided to clear the top of my reading list with a different algorithm that the usual I used in the last year. And oh , what a delightful jewel. This book was fun, and it was funny. Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
259,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
260,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
261,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
262,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
263,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
264,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
265,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
266,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."

The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
268,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
269,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
270,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,Probably only the second non-fiction book that has made me sit up thrilled through an entire night reading and feel terribly disappointed as it ended almost without my noticing it. Full review to be put up soon.
271,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,3,"3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park & Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought ""I want to do this walk!!"" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner."
272,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71481878-theresa-jackson,5,"Very funny as usual! I started off the book thinking ""What a great idea, I'd love to do a hike like this,"" and ended it with a profound respect for how long and difficult the trek was. Definitely not one for my bucket list, unfortunately!"
273,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don,1,"I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved ""Measure of a Mountain,"" by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well."

I just liked it. I found that it did not hold my attention for long periods. It is the fourth Bill Bryson text I have read, and I’ll read more. But not because of this one.In “A Walk in the Woods” Bill Bryson attempts to walk the Appalachian Trail with a childhood friend. The book documents that attempt, and mixes in some history of the Trail and other miscellany within the travelogue. I enjoyed the parts of the book most that did not involve Bryson’s attempt at the Trail, which I doubt was his intention.I think one of my issues with “A Walk in the Woods” is that Bill Bryson is too snarky and derisive of people a little too much for my tastes. Although the travelogue is clever at times, it just did not consistently grab me.“A Walk in the Woods” is a good book. It has a clear appreciation for the natural grandeur of the eastern United States, and I learned some things I did not know. No complaints about reading it."
275,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/692133-julian-worker,4,"I rated this at 7/10 in terms of his other books. It's not his best, but it's better than most other books in this genre. The film was ridiculous. As a sequel, I'm surprised Bill Bryson didn't walk along the Pennine Way in the UK or perhaps the south-west coastal path."
276,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93380789-martin,5,"Facing savage weather, merciless insects, unreliable maps and a fickle companion whose profoundest wish was to go to a motel and watch The X-Files, Bryson gamely struggled through the wilderness of the Appalachian Trail to achieve a lifetime's ambition - not to die outdoors.I'll just get some hiking equipmentI ended up with enough equipment to bring ful employment to a vale of sherpas--a three-season tent, self-inflating sleeping pad, nested pots and pans, collapsible eating utensils, plastic dish and cup, complicated pump-action water purifier, stuff sacks in a rainbow of colors, seam sealer, patching kit, sleeping bag, bungee cords, water bottles, waterproof poncho, waterproof matches, pack cover, a rather nifty compass/thermometer keyring, a little collapsible stove that looked frankly like trouble, gas bottle and spare gas bottle, a hands-free flashlight that you wore on your head like a miner's lamp (this I liked very much), a big knife for killing bears and hillbillies, insulated long Johns and undershirts, four bandannas, and lots of other stuff, for some of which I had to go back again and ask what it was for exactly.Asking for a travel companionThen one day in late February, with departure nigh, I got a call. It was from an old school friend named Stephen Katz.""Are you sure you're up for this?"" I asked.""Absolutely.""""What kind of shape are you in?""""Real good. I walk everywhere these days.""""Really?"" This is most unusual in America.""Well, they repossessed my car, you see.""My last words to him were, ""So, how are you with bears?""""Hey, they haven't got me yet!""Bill's wife is not sure that Katz is the best companion.""You have nothing in common,"" she said.""We have everything in common. We're forty-four years old. We'll talk about hemorrhoids and lower back pain and how we can't remember where we put anything, and the next night I'll say, 'Hey, did I tell you about my back problems?' and he'll say, 'No, I don't think so,' and we'll do it al over again. It'll be great.""Long underwear for wolvesThe man at the check-in desk looked at our tickets to Atlanta and our packs and said--quite alertly, I thought, for a person wearing a shortsleeve shirt in winter--""You fellows hiking the Appalachian Trail?""""Sure are,"" said Katz proudly.""Lot of trouble with wolves down in Georgia, you know.""""Really?"" Katz was all ears.""Oh, yeah. Coupla people been attacked recently. Pretty savagely, too, from what I hear."" He messed around with tickets and luggage tags for a minute. ""Hope you brought some long underwear.""Katz screwed up his face. ""For wolves?""""No, for the weather. There's gonna be record cold down there over the next four or five days. Gonna be wel below zero in Atlanta tonight.""""Oh, great,"" Katz said and gave a ruptured, disconsolate sigh. He looked challengingly at the man. ""Any other news for us? Hospital call to say we got cancer or anything?""The beginning of the TrailAhead of me spread a vast, stark world of winter-dead trees. I stepped portentously on to the path, a fragment of the original Appalachian Trail from the days when it passed here en route from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer.The date was March 9, 1996. We were on our way.The route led down into a wooded val ey with a chuckling stream edged with brittle ice, which the path followed for perhaps half a mile before taking us steeply up into denser woods. This was, it quickly became evident, the base of the first big hill, Frosty Mountain, and it was immediately taxing. The sun was shining and the sky was a hearty blue, but everything at ground level was brown--brown trees, brown earth, frozen brown leaves--and the cold was unyielding. I trudged perhaps a hundred feet up the hill, then stopped, bug-eyed, breathing hard, heart kabooming alarmingly. Katz was already falling behind and panting even harder. I pressed on.Katz is lost and found""It was a miracle, I swear to God. Just when I was about to lie down and give myself to the wolves and bobcats, I look up and there's a white blaze on a tree and I look down and I'm standing on the AT. At the mudslick, as a matter of fact. I sat down and had three smokes one after the other, just to calm myself down, and then I thought, 'Shit, I bet Bryson's walked by here while I've been blundering around in the woods, and he'll never come back because he's already checked this section of trail.' And then I began to worry that I never would see you again. So I really was glad when you turned up. To tell you the truth, I've never been so glad to see another person in my whole life, and that includes some naked women.""It is a long trail and every bit has some history. I'm not going to describe each footstep, river crossed, mountain climbed etc as Bill Bryson does this in great definition mixed with fear and humor. Just watch out for; bears, moose, deer, mosquitoes, angry guards, dubious hill billies, drunk drivers, flooded rivers, snowstorms and weird hikers.Enjoy!"
277,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"""We trudged through a cold, silent world of bare trees, beneath pewter skies, on ground like iron.""The events in this book took place in 1996 when Bill Bryson was living in New Hampshire and noticed a disappearing trail going through the region. He wondered where it led. It was the Appalachian Trail which in its entirety was more than 2,100 miles in length, snaking along the eastern seaboard, crossing 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Bryson thought it might be a good idea to walk the trail. What better way to get fit while reacquainting himself with his native land after living 20 years abroad. He also thought it would be good to learn to fend for himself, and because of the effects of global warming, with many of the trees sadly dying off, it was best to experience the trail sooner rather than later. After announcing his plans to anyone who would listen, Bryson then read up on the trail and learned of all the dangers, the stories of disease, hunger, predators, and the people murdered when hiking it, to say nothing of the mental toll. ""The American woods have been unnerving people for 300 years. The inestimably priggish and tiresome Henry David Thoreau thought nature was splendid, splendid indeed, so long as he could stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core. This wasn’t the tame world of overgrown orchards and sun-dappled paths that passed for wilderness in suburban Concord, Massachusetts, but a forbidding, oppressive, primeval country that was 'grim and wild … savage and dreary,' fit only for 'men nearer of kin to the rocks and wild animals than we.' The experience left him, in the words of one biographer, 'near hysterical.' Same goes for Daniel Boone: 'When Daniel Boone is uneasy, you know it’s time to watch your step.'""Bryson thought it best to look for someone to accompany him, and eventually, he teamed up with an old school buddy he hadn't seen more than a handful of times during the past 25 years. What ensued as they set foot on the trail was a test of endurance, both physical and mental. It also tested their patience and their sense of humor as they suffered more than a handful of mishaps and miscalculations. This was my first time reading a book by Bill Bryson and I'm sure it won't be the last, despite the average rating I gave this book. I enjoyed his easy manner when telling a story. But the story wasn't what I was expecting. True, it was better in some ways than I thought it would be, but not as good as I had hoped in other ways. I'll start with the good. This book was more than a journey along the Appalachian Trail. It was a step by step history lesson, a lesson in ecology and environmental devastation, a psychological study, a log of personal growth, and in a way, it was the story of a friendship, one that had lapsed but continued on after a resting phase. It was fun tagging along with Bryson and his friend as they toiled on the trail, and without me having to do any of the trudging myself and without me even breaking a sweat. I stayed dry, well-fed, and comfy, which is more than I can say for the two hikers. So this book was great for an armchair traveler such as myself. But unfortunately, too often, the book dragged for me. It was bogged down by too many details I could have done without, which slowed the pace like an overstuffed pack can slow hikers. I also wished for less repetition concerning their daily routine and more dramatic moments. And while I enjoyed the humor, I didn't enjoy the parts that targeted overweight people and people living in the south. I assumed Bryson changed people's names, if not the locations, but I still doubt if he would be welcome in certain places should he return to them. But most of all, I was disappointed in something I really didn't expect. (view spoiler)[Bryson only hiked a relatively small portion of the trail, skipping many states, and he sometimes took cabs or rides into town to stay at inns and eat at restaurants. I thought he'd be roughing it more and completing the entire trail. (hide spoiler)]But overall, this was a good solid book from which I learned much about the history of that region, the environment, botany, geography, geology, and more, and all of it in an easy to read style that was even surprisingly poetic, at times. ""So I would put myself in darkness and lie there listening to the peculiarly clear, articulated noises of the forest at night, the sighs and fidgets of wind and leaves, the weary groan of boughs, the endless murmurings and stirrings, like the noises of a convalescent ward after lights out, until at last I fell heavily asleep."""
278,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki,5,"What a delightful, conversational, cosy read. I loved this book from cover to cover; it made me laugh (sometimes to the very edge of tears), made me think, but most of all it took me on a scenic ride thought the majestic wilderness of the Appalachian trail. Bill Bryson’s lovely and thoughtful narration is just a joy to read. "
279,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,3,I liked the first half of the book more!
280,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808367-nita-kohli,5,"I am not a kind of a person who loves to travel or someone who enjoys vacations in different parts of a country. I am one of those (if there are other such people) who hate or at least who don't enjoy travelling. The thought of long commutes via flights and trains carrying around your luggage - gives me nightmares. Even within city or town, I don't leave house if I don't have a purpose to do so. I enjoy staying at home leaving my comfortable abode only if there is a need to do so or if I have bored myself to death after a long, long stay at home. So, me picking up a book on travel would have never happened! But, it did! Sometime back I won a competition and as a prize I got five books including A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson. So, that's how I got this book, had I not won it in a prize, I would have not purchased it. It stood on my shelf for quite a few months(to be precise, 6 months). I was looking for my next read and I wanted to read something funny and I picked up this book. From whatever I had heard of it and from what I saw in the trailer of the movie by the same name, I knew that this is a book about a guy who goes hiking and it has some humour in it. So, I decided to try it.As a reader, it is usually good to read something out of your comfort zone - something you usually don't read. I, for example, love to read fiction and if I further narrow it down, I prefer fantasy and contemporary. But, I do juggle between various genres in fiction and non fiction is what is out of my comfort zone - it is something that I generally don't like to pick up. But, I do make an effort and pick a couple of non fiction books in a year. So, this year, I got out of my comfort zone and read this book and I am grateful that I did. This was a non fiction book on travelling - both don't interest me even the least bit but I still loved this book and I have a new favourite author - Bill Bryson! PlotIn this book, Bill Bryson along with his friend, Katz , hikes the Appalachian Trail trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. The trail is breathtakingly beautiful with mountains, lakes and forests. But, the trail also offers some wild animals like bears, ever-changing weather, rugged terrain, insects and many other things that one does not want to face.CharactersBill Bryson is an amazing narrator who is not only apt at providing hilarious details in way that make you laugh your gut out but also provides scientific details in manner that you do do not lose interest. The way he talks to his readers keeps you hooked to the book. Despite the fact that Bill is great, I loved Katz more. Katz is funny, at times unreliable and crazy but these are the attributes that made me love him. And he is very real. There were numerous time when I laughed like crazy on his dialogues and his actions. What I likeI loved Bill Bryson's writing; it is simple and captivating. When I went into this book, I had limited knowledge of Appalachian Trail and American geography. Geographic details and activities like hiking are of no interest to me(I am not into outdoor activities) and going into this book, I feared that I might give it up midway or even before that. But, thanks to author's remarkable narration that I not only completed the book but thoroughly enjoyed it. If an author can make you love a book about something that you usually don't like then he has to be fantastic. I came to know about a lot of facts, be it environmental, scientific, historical, without getting bored. The environmental issues were eye-opening. What I did not likeI had no complaints with this book. My final thoughts on the bookThis was my first book from Bill Bryson and I look forward to reading more of his books in future. An immensely enjoyable and fun read with very real and hilarious characters/people. This book makes you laugh but at the same time informs you about how our planet is suffering and how the several environmental issues threaten the flora and fauna on earth. A must read if you are looking for something fun and informative. Read this and my other reviews at www.book-choose.com"
281,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,4,"A few years ago, some friends, my brother, and I decided to do some backpacking around the Pictured Rocks area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It. Was. Awesome...the first day. And then it just hit the fan. Turns out we were woefully unprepaired for the storm that hit us and completely soaked our gear in the night, flooded the trails, and turned into imminent threat of lightning storms for the following night. We only finished half the route. It's bugged me ever since. After that I read Wild and felt immensely better about the whole experience. At least I knew how to set up the tent and use the stove BEFORE we were in the middle of nowhere. I went into Wild wanting to love the book with all my heart. I wanted the book to be about the trail and experience of the setting. Wild didn't do it for me on most levels. A Walk in the Woods was everything I hoped for in Wild and then some. I have to say, on a much smaller scale, I related to Bill Bryson! He doesn't pull punches. Backpacking sucks 70% of the time, you want cheeseburgers 50% of the time, your pack feels like it will crush you 90% the time, you hate anyone you see on the trail without a pack 100% of the time (look at the freedom and lightness in their step!), and you end up in this weird twilight zone of one-foot-in-front-of-the-other where time means nothing. You kind of just want to get where your going so it's over, but also love the view along the way. And then when it's all said and done, you want to do it again. He says all of this, and more, in a wittier, more entertaining, and more insightful way. I loved it. He captures the experience. Although he and his buddy only did about a third to half of the trail, in the end, almost 900 miles is nothing to look down your nose at! Unless you've finished the Appalachian...then by all means, look down your nose all day long. You've earned exclusive privilege. This book also took momentary time-outs to discuss flora, fauna, wildlife, and a handful of other interesting tidbits, and managed to do most of it without boring the reader. I loved the gentle moment towards the end between Bryson and Katz as well. All in all, an awesome way to start 2019's reading list and gave me the backpacking urge again...we'll see if I can wrangle my hubby into doing it with me this time. I'd highly recommend this book! The perspective is real. I'd rate this a PG-13 due to language, crass humor, and direct story-telling involving past trail-deaths."
282,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597352-linda,4,"At the recomendation of one of my bosses I took this book along on a strenuous 10 mile backcountry hike in Shenandoah that was full of amazing mountain-top vistas, stream crossings, and beautiful rocky trails framed with fall folliage.It is a hilarious book that recounts Byson's aventure of preparing for and hiking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail- which actually passes through Shenandoah just miles from where we were camping. I had started reading the book in the tent by the light of my flash-light when I came across Bryson's account of his prepatory reading before he left for his ambitious trip along with vivid discriptions of horrific bear incidents that have occourred along the Appalachian Trail. Bryson writes following these terrifying discriptions which even involved a small boy being ripped from his tent and mauled, ""Now imagine reading a nonfiction book packed with stories such as this- true tales soberly related- just before setting off alone on a camping trip of your own in the North American wilderness."" Then I found myself wanting to shout back at the book, ""NO, Bill Bryson- you imagine reading a nonfiction book such as this while you are in your tent in the dark- preparing to sleep just 100' away from a trail on which had passed numerous- and I mean numerous piles of bear droppings....""In light of the fact that I was surely going to get little sleep- especially with my overactive imagination I read on and tried to listen for bears through the wind and my husband's bearlike snoring. Let's just say that having this hardcover book along on the trip was worth adding it's weight to my backpack. It provided excllent night-time reading entertainment, and if a bear had tried to rip into our tent, I could have tried to use it as a protective weapon! ;-)"
283,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830322-jasmin,2,"Bryson has a great sense of humor, and does a good job of capturing the quirkiness of backwood folk. However, I was sometimes frustrated by his viewpoints, which dampened my opinion and enjoyment of this book. For instance, Bryson says on page 199:""To tell you the truth I was getting a little wearied of this [remote wilderness]. I know the Apalachian Trail is suposed to be a wilderness experience, and I accept that there are countless places where it would be a tragedy for it to be otherwise, but sometimes, the ATC seems to be positively phobic about human contact. Personally, I would have been pleased to walking now through hamlets and past farms rather than through some silent 'protected corridor'"".I think that it is wonderful that we still have the amount of protected forest we do in the US. There are surely plenty of places to walk through lovely farmland in the US as there is in England, but fortunately we still have the luxury of having more secluded wilderness as well. Its unfortunate that he can't appreciate that, and walk along one of the other numerous trails that are more exposed to human contact rather than put misconceiving thoughts into uninformed minds. Its just frustrating. There are several other times throughout the book where this attitude is apparent, and it put a damper on my reading experience."

I've just been so busy with editing The First Empire, that's been consuming a huge amount of my time.But...Once again I really enjoyed this book. Bryson is always entertaining and I've moved on to yet another one."

At any rate, Bill Bryson's funny, realistic account of his hiking experiences was a real treat to read. His hiking amigo Katz is a riot. Bryson has an understanding wife since he's away so much, but she supports him. I love Bryson's lucid, flowing prose style. Recommended. "

Bryson is an outstanding story teller, an amazing person, and more than all the rest, he has his friend Katz (who was my star for this book).Imagine that one morning, you wake up and decide to start walking. Walking a lot. Walking the Appalachian trail. About 2146 (or maybe 2159 or 2164.7, nobody actually knows, and different people measured it quite different very much at the same time). Imagine that you are also 44 years old, and not in a great shape. And you plan to do this on your own. And then Katz comes in, with a phone call, and decides to join the ride (or walk, actually?). An ex-alcoholic, overweight, doughnut and pretty slow guy, maybe not the best body for this adventure. Or maybe, he is the best one?! I loved Katz, he was hilarious. In some parts where Bryson walked on his own, I missed Katz, and the gap was huge. I loved everything about this book, the complains, the people he met on the way (oh, Mary Ellen , what a great laugh), the places, and the animals. A bear, a moose, and a Chicken John, they are all going to make you enjoy this story. Bryson can make your jaw hurt from smiling and laughing. Bryson can make you want to take yourself and get out there, and walk in the woods. Bryson is witty, funny and super sweet. I am a fan. 5 stars of joy. "
289,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/232155-kelly,2,"""A Walk in the Woods"" is proof that if you have already written a few books that have sold well, publishers will apparently let you do anything. In the beginning I loved it, because the two hikers were not these super outdoorsy types who keep up with all the latest hiking gear and get all pretentious about trails. (As a person who was a business major in college but grew up with two siblings who both majored in recreation, park, and tourism science and are fairly uppity about the outdoors, I can really appreciate a regular person making an attempt to go hiking.) So the first third of the book was great, two out of shape, middle age men hiking the Applachian Trail. Then after they crossed a few states, they quit. After that, the book becomes absolutely pointless. It has a lot of interesting historical information about the AT and stories of other hikers, but it is obviously just filler that Bryson had to add once he realized that he was not going to get a book out of hiking the trail because he was back home, presumably doing crossword puzzles in bed. After spending the middle of the book aimlessly doing day hikes, Bryson and his hiking partner meet up to hike Maine. I was truly surprised when they quit again in Maine. The book was a disappointment. It should have been the experiences of a thru hiker on the AT as told by Bill Bryson. He is enjoyable to read, but the story was utterly pointless.Two additional gripes: I HATE being blatently misled by book jackets. Not only is there a bear on the front cover, but the back cover also claims that they meet bears along the way. They met no bears along the trail. And I am going slowly insane with publishers' need to claim that every book is ""hilarious!"". While the writing was enjoyable, I don't think it was even meant to be funny.I will read more of Bill Bryson's work if I come across it, but I'm not recommending ""A Walk in the Woods"" to anyone."
290,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Travel books are strange things. They generally seem to be written by men, men alone. It doesn't seem to matter that these men, in their real lives, have families. It is like some sort of terribly odd quest. One day they walk into the kitchen and say, ""Darling, I'm going to write a book about Turkey - and I need to do this alone."" There is a real a-man's-got-to-do-what-a-man's-got-to-do feel about so many travel books. Many of Bryson's others are just this sort of book. A lone man out travelling and telling of his adventures. There is an almost quixotic feel to these quests - and I guess that is part of their charm.In this one Bill brings along a friend, and for me it made all the difference. Interestingly, his family are still not invited.I remember reading this on a train and trying, unsuccessfully, not to laugh while his was explaining the effect thinking he was hearing a bear come up to his tent had on his sphincter muscle.This is the sort of book that makes you want to buy a backpack and go off into the woods. Though, there must be better food to bring along. It also gives a very interesting history of this walking trail. It sounds like a completely stunning part of the world."
291,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721225-steve,1,"At the dawn of the twentieth-century, journalists, travel writers, social workers, and adventure seekers descended on the Appalachian Mountains in droves, expecting to find a land of violent, uneducated ""hillbillies"" whose primary occupations were distilling illegal alcohol and killing one another. That they were mistaken in their assumptions has been demonstrated time and again, in both popular and academic literature.Almost 100 years later, writer Bill Bryson took a walk on the Appalachian trail, and expected to find the exact same thing. That he DID NOT walk into a scene out of the movie Deliverance seems to genuinely surprise him, but not to the point that he refrains from insulting Appalachian mountain people over and over again, as if the stereotypes of the ultra-violent hillbilly are utterly true and representative of the entire Appalachian population.The book is amusing on some levels, if only because I have hiked on the A.T. and identify with some of the hardships he faces. That and he rightly criticizes the National Park Service for its poor stewardship of the lands it forcibly seized from Appalachian farmers. Otherwise, this book is of scant value -- unless, of course, one needs paper to aid in starting a fire, or to make a nice set of paper dolls. "
292,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"This is a wonderful book to listen to while traveling with a group of people. It will keep you interested and laughing heartily all the way to your destination.Bryson decided one day that it would be a neat thing to hike the Appalachian Trail – all 2,160 miles of it (although the actual length varies depending on the page you might be on in the official guides or what year it is, because the trail is constantly being changed and moved).Deciding to do a little research, he soon discovered that there are certain dangers to walking the trail, including bears, assorted diseases, and “loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantitiesof impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex.” Henry Thoreau, that great 18-month adventurer into the wilds a shortwalk from his town, helped create a great nostalgia for the woods, even though, as Bryson notes, he could “stroll to town for cakes and barley wine, but when he experienced real wilderness, on a visit to Katahdin in 1846, he was unnerved to the core.”Bryson decided to take Stephen Katz along for the trip. Katz is a character who shows up in several of Bryson’s other books. He’s fat andlazy --he throws away their water supply to make his pack lighter-- and soon Bryson discovers that this may not be the little walk in thewoods he had expected. After several weeks on the trail, in rather miserable weather, they arrive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. There, he finds a map of the entire trail, about six inches wide and four feet long, and discovers to his horror that he and Katz have only traveled two inches on the map. “My hair had grown more than that,” he reports.Even though it’s a very funny book, Bryson makes several serious observations, discussing the mismanagement of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency that builds more roads than any construction company; it supervises and has built more than 378,000 miles of roads, more than eight times the total mileage of the interstate highway system. Most ofthese are to service the needs of logging companies that need to get in to chop down more trees. Bryson also discusses the American ambivalence toward nature. We revere it, but are afraid of it as well. The woods are beautiful, but they “choke off views and leave youmuddled and without bearings. They make you feel small and confused and vulnerable, like a small child lost in a crowd of strange legs.” A lot of wilderness still exists in the United States, as he discovers on a section of totally uninhabited wilderness the trail traverses in Maine (he decided to do short sections of the trail after his epiphany in Gatlinburg).This week-long march leaves the hikers completely on their own and is nowhere near any kind of help should one get into trouble (the AT kills several people yearly). There’s still a lot of nature out there; only 2 percent of the United States is classified as built up and 15,600,000 square miles are completely wooded, without a single resident, and remain impressive despite our mismanagement of the ecology and massive logging. Bryson ended up walking a total of 870 miles of the trail – not an inconsequential feat. Of the two thousand or so who make the attemptevery year, only about two hundred finish. "
293,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1853807-eric-aiello,4,"Quite seriously the funniest and most inspiring book I've read in a long time. The first half (or so) of the book with Katz was hilarious. The brief intermission without Katz was very interesting, but damn, I couldn't wait for Katz to show up again. The last few chapters when Bryson and Katz were hiking the 100 mile wilderness in Maine were tear-and-convulsion-inducingly hilarious. Wonderful, wonderful read!This entire book is worth the read if only for the part that Bryson describes the moose he sees in Maine and, consequently, the moose species in general. I had to put the book down until I could pull myself together. I laughed with tears rolling down my cheeks for a few minutes. It was the single most hilarious thing I've ever read in a book before. Oh, and this book has made me seriously consider (not just daydream about) hiking at least half of the Appalachian Trail. Presumably I'll do it before grad school - but damnit, I'm going to do it!"
294,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29647641-nathan,1,"DNF at 31%. I don't find Bill Bryson funny at all. Zero laughs. Not even a chuckle, though there were plenty of times I could tell he was trying to be funny. As a result, Bryson comes off as a smug dick. I hated this book and stopped when I did so I wouldn't end up hating the Appalachian Trail too.Bill Bryson's Spirit Animal"
295,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930089-kim,5,"What an amazing journey! I usually do not read memoirs, but I love the outdoors and have heard great things about this book. I really enjoyed reading about their adventure. It is well written and entertaining. I am very happy to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. I look forward to seeing the movie! "
296,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"3.5 starsLet me begin this review by pointing out that this was a buddy-read with my fake-adoptive daddy-dearest, Paul. And if we had actually taken a walk in the woods together, he would have left me to the bears. Paul, this one's for you. *evil grin*This book is about a middle-aged guy, the author, suddenly having the idea to walk the Appalachian Trail. In Germany we call that a Schnappsidee. Don't get me wrong, I myself LOVE hiking and nature, especially woods. What I hate is people, typical city dwellers, who think they can conquer the earth but balk at the very idea of a few leaves rustling. You know, people who run around screaming as if Godzilla was after them, making a little squirrel feel damn proud and self-important.That was the author at the beginning of the book. He read all kinds of literature about bear attacks, diseases and murders in the history of the Appalachian Trail, working himself up until he had a fit and was generally panicking for no reason at all. Sure, you need to be careful but if you are being smart and reasonable, it's not that big of a deal! It was quite unnerving and annoying. Then he went on to make the owner of an outdoor store very rich by being stupid enough to let himself be talked into buying shit nobody needs. *rolls eyes*So we weren't off to a good start, Mr. Bryson and I. Add to that his weird-ass travel companion, Katz, who was hopelessly out of shape. Now, for honesty's sake let me say that I wouldn't be able to hike over 2000 miles myself either (at least I wouldn't want to do it alone and would want someone with experience with me), but there is a difference between not being as fit as an Army Ranger and being as unfit as Katz obviously was. *lol* If Mr. Bryson helped the squirrel's self-confidence, then Katz helped that of a slug. At least in the beginning.Interestingly though it was exactly Katz that made the trip so funny in my opinion. It shows in his way of dealing with certain encounters (humans mostly, but also that night-time visit of whatever comes to mind). There were quite a few situations in which the dry humour and situational comedy were very enjoyable. Sadly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny, but still good.Furthermore, the highlight for me personally was all the information Mr. Bryson put into this. I've learned tons about the Appalachian Trail (historically and biologically/geologically) and cannot believe the way people go about hiking in the US. I mean, I'm sure there are enough stupid Europeans too, but what the author described here, the encounters he and Katz had ... it's disconcerting (it would be immeasurably funny if it wasn't such evidence of incapacity).Sure, without all the chapters containing actual information the book would have never gotten the required page count, but I love reading about history and geology and this was the perfect combination. I was shocked and appalled when reading about the National Park Service causing the extinction of so many species of animals (fish, songbirds, foxes, ...) and going about their work all wrong (even today) and very saddened when reading about the extinction of the American Chestnut (to name just one tree species) due to an imported Asian fungus. I was delighted when reading about New England having been 70% farmland and 30% woods back in the day, while now it's exactly the other way around. I squealed with delight when the author confirmed (or was very cautious to do so) that tracks and droppings found were actually that of eastern mountain lions. And I agreed with the author how awful it is when people go hiking but are carrying around laptops and all manner of other (most of the time useless) technology. #teamnatureThus, this was quite a mixed bag for me. Enjoyable, sure, but not as funny as I had hoped after what other people told me about it. The most pleasing thing was how much both Mr. Bryson and Katz got into the whole hiking experience and being in nature and all. That was most notable when they had to split up for a while (you know, because of life) and the autor talked about how going everywhere by car revolted him so he started going on little hiking trips on his own.I'd say this book gets a recommendation from me, not for the humour that supposedly made it famous, but because of the way in which the author makes you learn about a very important and beautiful part of the United States."
297,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4881152-me,4,"Follow the Appalachian Trail with Bill Bryson as he and an acquaintance from his past attempt to hike the entire 2,100 or so miles. The book is educational as well as entertaining, as Bryson cites the history and the ecology surrounding the areas that he visits. At the end of their journey (they only hike about half of the miles) Bryson has developed a life-long friendship with Stephan Kats, his hiking partner. "
298,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602796-linda,4,"Enjoyed A Walk in the Woods..... Bryson has a way of telling a story that puts you right there with him, very entertaining, found myself chuckling quite a few times at the antics of two friends trying their luck at hiking the Appalachian Trail..... love books about hiking in the wilderness. Now I want to see the movie made about this starring Robert Redford & Nick Nolte!"
299,0307279464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,3,"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. Bill Bryson is freakin hilarious! One of my favorite quotes: ""What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at children's parties - I daresay it would even give a merry toot - and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.""

I DIED. Then came back to life, read this over again, and died again. There were so many LOL parts throughout the book. I kept having to control my giggles at work. I also liked the history and science behind the making of the trail, the trees/animals of the trail, and the areas that it passes through. It was spaced out enough to be interesting, but not get tedious.What I didn't like:Perhaps this is because I just recently read Wild, but I was a little disappointed he actually did so little of the trail. And honestly, the miles and miles that he drove/hiked and came home shouldn't count either. Neither should staying in a hotel at every chance. I guess to me, making a commitment to hike a long trail like this is a pure and holy thing, and it felt a little like sacrilege that he seemed to disregard it and be so unwilling to leave his privileged life behind. I mean, to each his own, but I would NEVER even think about publishing a book about a trail that, in actuality, I only hiked 39% (his words!) of. Overall, this was a fun and entertaining read, but it didn't garner much respect for the author as a ""hiker""."
