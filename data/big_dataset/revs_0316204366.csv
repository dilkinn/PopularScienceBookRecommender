0,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"Gladwell is taking a lot of heat for biasing the examples he chooses in his books to make points that are often later shown to be somewhat tenuous. That may be the case, but he is a heck of a writer. He knows how to tell a compelling story and the conversations he sparks go on for years. Whatever harm that may come from the lack of rigorousness in his brand of pop-psychology is easily overshadowed by the positive cultural impact that comes from people giving serious consideration to his ideas and how they apply to their personal lives and to society on a larger scale. As with any book, don't read it passively, decide what you buy and what needs to be further examined. Enjoy it, it's a fun read.[Update]I came across a cool and relevant quote in The Tell-Tale Brain by V. S. Ramachandran from Darwin's The Descent of Man:""...false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward errors is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened."""

Much like a born again who reads the bible for the first time, I have never been able to relate to a book as well as with David & Goliath.Disclosure: I'm a dyslexic who spent all of his youth struggling through school -- spending my lunches tirelessly improving my spelling while everyone else spent their lunch break improving their rest. Things turned out all right, I was one of the first dyslexics at my school to graduate with an International Baccalaureate diploma and to receive the award for Extended Essay (the longest and most time consuming piece an 18-year-old writes). And then recently I wrote a piece on my blog about criminal systems in Europe and America. It was a personal project which led me through months of research and reflection. I titled it, ""To punish is to promote: How criminal justice systems can encourage crime"" and came to the conclusion that in some instances punishment may actually have the opposite effect intended. In other words, I realized the limits of power. So then to read Gladwell's David & Goliath was more than just an experience I could understand but completely relate with. It was so empowering to know I wasn't alone, that there were many more remote misses fighting to be just as good as everyone else in school and ending up with skills no class can teach. If you haven't read David & Goliath you won't really understand what I'm speaking about. But I'd encourage everyone to read it. It will make you realize that there's no such thing as simple, black and white. There's grey. There's yellow, blue, pink, orange, you name it. It will allow you to understand that for every difficult hardships life will throw at you you'll learn skills everyone else will wish they had. So go on, read and be inspired to turn every disadvantage in your life into your strongest asset."

The Art of Avoiding Bestsellers: A Field Guide for Authors
How do books succeed?By getting into the Bestseller lists? By making a few millions? By winning the most prestigious awards of the day?Wrong.These are very narrow views on what constitutes success for a work of art, especially literature or serious non-fiction. If we redefine success, we might find that these very things that confers ‘success’ in the short term might be hurting the artist/author the most in the long term. This applies to prestigious prizes such as Bookers as well, as we will see. We might even get an idea of why so few of the Booker winning books seem to be good enough a few years after their moment of glory. (Spoiler: (view spoiler)[They cater to the jury and the prevailing standards of judgement, which may become old too soon. (hide spoiler)])+++Let us illustrate this by taking an example from this very book. This reviewer has to warn the reader that the example is originally invoked in the book for another purpose though it has been adopted more or less verbatim here, but we need to get into that now. (By the way, the careful reader should also be able to divine why this small essay is can also serve as a review for this book in particular and to all of Mr. Gladwell’s books in general.)Let us go back to 19th century France. Art was a big deal in the cultural life of France back then. Painting was regulated by the government and was considered a profession in the same way that medicine or the law is a profession today. The Professionals who did well would win awards and prestigious fellowships. And at the pinnacle of the profession was The Salon, the most important art exhibition in all of Europe.+++Every year each of the painters of France submitted two or three of his finest canvases to a jury of experts, bringing their work to the 
Palais de l’Industrie
, an exhibition hall built for the Paris World Fair between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine. Throughout the next few weeks, the jury would vote on each painting in turn. Those deemed unacceptable would be stamped with the red letter “R” for rejected. Those accepted would be hung on the walls of the Palais, and over the course of six weeks beginning in early May, as many as a million people would throng the exhibition. The best paintings were given medals. The winners were celebrated and saw the value of their paintings soar - became ‘bestsellers’. The losers limped home and went back to work.“There are in Paris scarcely fifteen art-lovers capable of liking a painting without Salon approval,” Renoir once said. “There are 80,000 who won’t buy so much as a nose from a painter who is not hung at the Salon.”The Salon was the most important art show in the world. In short, for a painter in nineteenth-century France, the Salon was everything - the Booker Committee and the Bestseller List rolled into one.+++And now, the twist:In spite of the all the benefits, the acceptance by the Salon also came with a large cost: for the truly creative and path breaking (let us take for example the Impressionists such as Monet, which is the case study taken up by the book):1. It required creating the kind of art that they did not find meaningful,2. & They risked being lost in the clutter of other artists’ work. Was it worth it?The Salon was the place where reputations were made. And what made it special was how selective it was. There were roughly three thousand painters of “national reputation” in France in the 1860s, and each submitted two or three of his best works to the Salon, which meant the jury was picking from a small mountain of canvases. Rejection was the norm. Getting in was a feat. “The Salon is the real field of battle,” Manet said. “It’s there that one must take one’s measure.”  It was the place where “you could succeed in making a noise, in defying and attracting criticism, coming face-to-face with the big public.”But the very things that made the Salon so attractive—how selective and prestigious it was—also made it problematic.No painter could submit more than three works. The crowds were often overwhelming. The Salon was the Big Pond. But it was very hard to be anything at the Salon but a Little Fish.+++Night after night, the rebels (the Impressionists) argued over whether they should keep knocking on the Salon door or strike out on their own and stage a show just for themselves. Did they want to be a Little Fish in the Big Pond of the Salon or a Big Fish in a Little Pond of their own choosing?The problem for the rebels such as the Impressionists was The Salon’s attitude: it was cautious, traditional. It had a reputation to uphold for being the voice of approval. It could not afford to make mistakes.“Works were expected to be microscopically accurate, properly ‘finished’ and formally framed, with proper perspective and all the familiar artistic conventions,” the art historian Sue Roe writes. “Light denoted high drama, darkness suggested gravitas. In narrative painting, the scene should not only be ‘accurate,’ but should also set a morally acceptable tone. An afternoon at the Salon was like a night at the Paris Opéra: audiences expected to be uplifted and entertained. For the most part, they knew what they liked, and expected to see what they knew.”The kinds of paintings that won medals, Roe says, were huge, meticulously painted canvases showing scenes from French history or mythology, with horses and armies or beautiful women, with titles like Soldier’s Departure, Young Woman Weeping over a Letter, and Abandoned Innocence.The Impressionists, on the other hand, had an entirely different idea about what constituted art.They painted everyday life. Their brushstrokes were visible. Their figures were indistinct. To the Salon jury and the crowds thronging the Palais, their work looked amateurish, even shocking, and was repeatedly turned down. They had no hope of making waves in the Big Pond of The Salon.+++The Big Fish–Little Pond GambitPissarro and Monet were smarter. They conjured up an alternative to the shackles of the Salon.They thought it made more sense to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond. If they were off by themselves and held their own show, they said, they wouldn’t be bound by the restrictive rules of the Salon, where the medals were won by paintings of soldiers and weeping women. They could paint whatever they wanted. And they wouldn’t get lost in the crowd, because there wouldn’t be a crowd.In 1873, Pissarro and Monet proposed that the Impressionists set up a collective called the Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs. There would be no competition, no juries, and no medals. Every artist would be treated as an equal.The Impressionists’ exhibition opened on April 15, 1874, and lasted one month. The entrance fee was one franc. There were 165 works of art on display, including three Cézannes, ten paintings by Degas, nine Monets, five Pissarros, six Renoirs, and five by Alfred Sisley—a tiny fraction of what was on the walls of the Salon across town. In their show, the Impressionists could exhibit as many canvases as they wished and hang them in a way that allowed people to actually see them.This was the first exhibition of ""Impressionism"". It was here that Critic Louis Leroy took the title of a work by Monet, 'Impression, Sunrise' to deride exposure and then went on to qualify these artists, quite skeptically, as ""Impressionists.""The name stuck.+++This historic show brought the artists some critical attention. Not all of that attention was positive: one joke (in addition to the name 'impressionism' itself!) told was that what the Impressionists were doing was loading a pistol with paint and firing at the canvas.But that was the second part of the Big Fish–Little Pond bargain. The Big Fish–Little Pond option might be scorned by some on the outside, but Small Ponds are welcoming places for those on the inside. They have all of the support that comes from community and friendship—and they are places where innovation and individuality are not frowned upon.“We are beginning to make ourselves a niche,” a hopeful Pissarro wrote to a friend. “We have succeeded as intruders in setting up our little banner in the midst of the crowd.” Their challenge was “to advance without worrying about opinion.” He was right. Off by themselves, the Impressionists found a new identity. They felt a new creative freedom, and before long, the outside world began to sit up and take notice.In the history of modern art, there has never been a more important or more famous exhibition. If you tried to buy the paintings in that warren of top-floor rooms today, it would cost you more than a billion dollars.+++In the end, the Impressionists were lucky to make the right choice, which is one of the reasons that their paintings hang in every major art museum in the world. But this same dilemma comes up again and again, and often the choice made is not as wise.Their story should remind today’s top artists and authors that there is a point at which money and mainstream recognition stop making them and start breaking them. The story of the Impressionists suggests that when the artists/authors strive for the best and attach great importance to getting into the Bestseller lists and Booker Lists, rarely do they stop and consider—as the Impressionists did—whether this is always in their best interest:1. One of the important lessons the Impressionists could teach the modern artists is that there are times and places where it is better to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond, where the apparent disadvantage of being an outsider in a marginal world turns out not to be a disadvantage at all.2. Another important lesson is that what counts in the end is if you let the Big Pond define you, or if you were brave enough to invent an alternative. The answer might not always be a Little Pond, but it sure can’t be meek acceptance of the current status quo path either.Think of all the great artists of the modern age who could hardly be defined as mainstream during their own lifetimes, who would never dream of writing for the approval of a committee, who were as far away from honors and awards and money as only exiles could be.Think of all the books with prestigious honors and the #1 bestseller mark that seem like jokes now.Think about how so many of our best authors seem to end up producing the same sort of exceptional trash - very well written, but hardly the real deal that would last a century.+++What then can be an alternative for the ones who want to break free? We can talk about one option that our case study suggests - it might not be the only option, and the creative ones can always come up with better option, but the exhortation of this reviewer is a simple one: that the really ambitions artists and authors need to start thinking hard about the best use of their own abilities and efforts.(Added here from the comments section, for clarity):To restate, in our day the artists have three options -1. Satisfy the Bank2. Satisfy the critics (or impress)3. Or satisfy their own genius (or impress)The last being the most risky and perhaps most important one.So what is the winning option again? For one thing, examples abound of niche novelists’ groups pushing the boundaries of literature, slowly attaining cult status and eventually becoming part of the canon itself. Just as Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, and Cézanne weighed prestige against visibility, selectivity against freedom, and decided the costs of the Big Pond were too great, it is time for the really serious to make the same call, of rejecting the conventional trappings of ‘success’ that only serves to limit their possibilities."
3,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5406348-tony,4,"No-one does insight porn quite as well as Malcolm Gladwell. His technique has been fairly well analysed before, and, with the publication of “David and Goliath” is currently under the spotlight again (e.g. http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/m... and http://blog.chabris.com/2013/10/why-m...). Even though much of the backlash often falls directly into the same traps of which he gets accused (e.g. critics cherry-picking the parts of his books that best support their complaints), the key argument is generally quite valid: Gladwell takes a minority, slightly counter-intuitive, perspective, highlights some evidence that possibly supports it, and ignores alternative readings of the same stories, and all the evidence for different positions.The key question is: how much does this matter?One of the central concepts in this book is that of the inverted U-curve — where an increase in something is valuable for a while, but then starts to become a negative (e.g. drinking some alcohol is good for your health, but drinking too much causes problems.) Gladwell applies this to numerous other areas, from teacher–student ratios, or the relationship between wealth and parenting, through to punishment for crimes. But one question not asked in this book, or any review I've seen of it so far, is whether Gladwell's own brand of pop-science might have exactly the same curve, and whether he might actually now be at the wrong end of it. This book contains two extended discussions on topics I know quite a lot about (the conflict in Northern Ireland, and the interpretation of the Biblical story of David and Goliath). In each there's an existing dominant narrative that is largely flawed. But directly attacking a dominant narrative generally has little effect (indeed, often simply reinforces it). A more effective approach to countering a position with which you disagree, and one that Gladwell is a master of, is to simply tell a better story with a different narrative. (There has been significant research on this area in recent years, particularly with respect to political debate, but there's also a long history of this in theology too, in the battles between heresy and orthodoxy.)On the left-hand side of the inverted U-curve, this is a very valuable function. Handled well this approach stimulates thinking and debate and, hopefully, leads to a deeper and more nuanced general understanding of the area. But this relies on arriving at a synthesis of both positions. The key problem with Gladwell, it seems to me, is that he's simply too good at what he does. He's such a superb story-teller that people read his books and come away convinced of his positions, accepting his narrative as being the complete truth itself, rather than simply as a valuable contribution to a wider debate and understanding.But I'm unconvinced that this is a flaw with his books and columns themselves. They're doing a very precise thing, and doing it very well. And this one is no exception. It's a delight to read, and raises a lot of very interesting and valuable questions. And those who wish to challenge the answers it offers would do well to learn from the approach, and start telling better stories themselves. "
4,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074042-amanda,2,"Now, there is a lot of skepticism about Gladwell and his research methods, but whether he self-selects his data or whatever, I think that the very nature of his writing indicates that his research isn't totally conclusive. So why bother reading him? Well, Gladwell, whether he's a legitimate social scientist(or whatever the term is) or not, is a pretty gifted writer. He has a knack for telling stories and presenting dry information, like statistics, in a compelling way. Plus, his theories are always provoking, if not convincing.I like to read Gladwell as more of a short story collector rather than reading his books as though they prove a single theory about humanity and how we live. Taking his chapters in isolation, he uses the form of the case study to advance some interesting ideas and I don't always agree with him.So if we think of David and Goliath as a collection of case studies that loosely revolve around a particular theme (power, the myth of advantage, and the underdog-something Gladwell is particularly obsessed by), several chapter are capable of provoking conversation such as his chapter on class sizes. Using a high school that can have classes as small as 12 kids, Gladwell talks about the ""too much of a good thing"" danger and succeeds in making us realize that small class sizes are not the golden solution to America's education problem and are not necessarily a good thing...but then he totally disrupts that train of thought when he validly mentions that a drop in class sizes across the board resulted in no appreciable gain because teachers weren't adapting their teaching methods.It seems to me that in his work there is always this give and take. He gives you an idea and some evidence to back it up...and then throws in some parallel story that either invalidates the first point or is completely irrelevant. For instance, he takes the founder of the Three Strikes Law and talks about the tragic circumstances that led to the law's genesis. He then talks about the problems of the law, weaves in some stuff about legitimate power and how cracking down harder on criminals is nonsense using Northern Ireland's history and a specific neighborhood in New York. At this point, I'm totally with it. But then he throws in a story that's meant to parallel Reynold's story-a family in Canada whose daughter is kidnapped and then years later found dead and subsequent investigations lead to the murderer being apprehended- and then talks about how this Canadian family chooses not to use their daughter's case to bring about change of the legal system..and attributes this to their Mennonite background. The overall effect is that it leaves the reader kind of confused and adds nothing to this underdog defeating the giant theme. These kinds of problems occur throughout the entire book and the ending leads one to wonder...what exactly was the point of all that, Gladwell?Added to the fact that much of this book seems to deal with stuff that's way too similar to the ground he covered with  Outliers , I'd only recommend this book to teachers looking for excerpts to use to provoke criticality about bias and research or using excerpts to introduce an idea about power, justice, etc."
5,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This guy writes so well. He draws you in with beautifully crafted stories. Murnane says in one of his books that he regretted having told people that some of his books were works of fiction and some essays. I really believe that creativity is essential for both these writing tasks, and that because real art prefers to hide, there is a good argument to be had in believing that more creativity is asked for in the writing of non-fiction than in fiction.Not that this guy really hides his artifice. His stories are painstakingly structured and his punches are delivered with such precision that it is hard not to want to applaud even as they slam into the side of your face.And I love that he leads me down the garden path. I wonder how many people will be caught in the depths of their prejudices only to find the tables being turned. It would be hard to make a more compelling argument, for instance, in favour of the Californian ‘three strikes and your in’ laws than he makes here or to find a way to so convincingly refute this emotional, logical and compelling argument almost immediately after.This book was infinitely confronting for me. If I was paranoid then I would have to assume Gladwell had gone out of his way to find every topic I find almost unbearable to think about – that somehow he had written this book as part of a bizarre vendetta against me. I’ve explained my problems with dyslexia before - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... - so want go through that again other than to say that I found this part of the book really hard going. I wouldn’t wish dyslexia on my worst enemy – shame and humiliation are not toys to be played with. As you can also see in that review, I’m from Belfast and left just before the Troubles started. That Gladwell discusses the internment here was and is and will always be like an open wound for me – my childhood consisted of hearing stories of rubber bullets fired into crowds of protestors and spent singing songs about armoured cars and tanks and guns that came to take away our sons, of collective punishments meted out by unfeeling monsters and of whole populations being guilty because they were Irish. Parts of this book held a mirror up to all of the things that made me feel different and odd and out of place in my childhood, all of the things that held me apart, and those things never really leave you, even if you haven’t thought about them for years.And if you want to make me full of an unquenchable fury, then talk of collaborators with the Nazis turning in Jews so they can to be transported to the death camps. Or of people refusing to buy clothes because a black person may have touched them. Or of black children being arrested and ‘checked for venereal disease’ as a means of humiliating them for asking for justice, for having to ask for what ought to have been theirs’ by birth right.And the worst of my nightmares are here too. I am a father of two daughters. This book was written to torture people like me. Torture us by showing our nightmares made real, lived out in the lives of people we would empathise with, but Gladwell forces from us more than merely our empathy, he places us in their shoes – he has us holding the hands of our own daughters as they lay dying or has us wait months to learn of their slow death by torture. I let very few writers take me to those places.This book has opened and scattered salt across virtually every wound and every scar, real and imagined, of which my life is constituted. All the same, read it. This isn’t a pleasant read by any stretch of the imagination, this isn’t something which is fun – but you’ll remember this book and it will make you think and it will make you feel – and there’s not much else to ask from books."

These things are fun to think about.Not everything he says is irrefutable fact. Some of his information is anecdotal. But he raises good questions. I think what he says is true, even though opposite or different views may be true. Some topics were a little slow, but I was frequently delighted and fascinated.MY FAVORITE TOPICS:The story of David and GoliathLess talented basketball players can win using full court press.The best class size for one teacher was 29. Too small, 9 was bad. The reason is students had more peers. There was more interaction, dialogue, and energy among the students. A class size of 36 was too large to be good.Two brilliant and talented students got into top colleges: a science major at Brown and a math major at Harvard. After two years they were so disheartened and disappointed that they switched to less rigorous majors. The reason is they were surrounded by so many bright minds, they felt average or below average in those fields. If they had gone to second tier schools, they would have been at the top of their classes and probably not changed majors.Dr. Jay Freireich lacked empathy for his patients - children with leukemia. Therefore, he was willing to experiment with painful and dangerous procedures for these children - things other doctors were unwilling to do. Under the care of empathetic doctors, children died from leukemia. But they were cured by Dr. Freireich’s procedures of repeated cocktails of painful drugs and large needles taking frequent and painful bone marrow samples. It is suggested that his lack of empathy was caused by lack of parental nurturing and love when he was a child.Dyslexics developed abilities that brought them great success.OTHER TOPICS:Too much money creates parenting problems.Different types of fear and lack of fear during the WWII bombings in London.Civil rights movement in Birmingham AlabamaThe British and Protestants vs the Catholics in IrelandCalifornia’s three strikes and you’re out - jailing criminalsThe Huguenots in France protecting Jews during WWIII was pleased the author provided a PDF file that audiobook buyers could download. It has the picture of the dog attacking a black man in Alabama which he talked about. It also has charts and a few references.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

7,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This is classic Malcolm Gladwell: A bunch of enjoyable and entertaining case studies grouped loosely under a thought-provoking theme. This time his theory is that being the underdog and having disadvantages can actually be an advantage.The title comes from a biblical story about a giant warrior named Goliath who was slain by David, a shepherd boy who was good with a slingshot. Gladwell analyzes the story and determines that the boy was not, in fact, an underdog, but was actually was a skilled hunter, and that Goliath didn't stand a chance against him.My favorite discussions in the book were about education, including the popular-but-apparently-not-true belief that small class sizes are always better. There were also some good stories about choosing colleges, and students reading this may be surprised to learn that a high-ranking school (such as the Ivy League) may not always be the best option for your career. There was also a good discussion about dyslexia, and why having challenges to overcome could actually help motivate you to be more successful.I finished this book a few days ago, and it is already fading fast from my mind, something that always happens to me with Gladwell books. I find his writing pleasant and his ideas interesting, but the details don't always stick. Recommended for those who want to feel like they've learned something, but you don't want to think too hard."
8,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901579-sarah-novak,4,"I've never hidden my stigmatized identity as an academic social scientist who loves Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell's books are routinely criticized by folks in my field for relying too heavily on anecdotes, conveniently selecting and interpreting supportive scientific studies, and imprecision/ overgeneralization. These points are valid, but I don't see them as damning. Gladwell isn't a scientist, and he's not writing textbooks. Ideally, he helps spark people's interest in research and makes them want to know more (and maybe less eager to de-fund science?). I enjoy getting swept up in Gladwell's story-telling and I like the way he weaves together a little research with a lot of engaging humanities / human-interest-type stuff. I don't always buy his arguments, and there's plenty to nit-pick, but I admire and enjoy his rhetorical style. His stories are juicy and memorable.David & Goliath is similar to Gladwell's previous trilogy of social science-y books. The theme here is situations where underdogs prevail and giants fail to benefit from their seemingly obvious advantages. As usual, the theme is diffuse and some of the stories are more germane, persuasive, or compelling than others. Still, I enjoyed taking the somewhat meandering, but also thought-provoking journey. "
9,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,3,"Malcolm Gladwell is one of those authors who you remember reading, but may not quite recall which book a particular phrase came from. They're all pretty similar.But that's the beauty of Gladwell. He's developing a coherent canon and, really, do you want to be surprised all the time? The world is disconcerting enough already.The title, David and Goliath, tells you exactly what this book is about. It's about the little guy who made good and, even better, who turned his adversities into strengths. In Gladwellian fashion there are illustrative anecdotes - from short basketball players, to orphaned children, to anti-Nazi French villagers - that expand upon the idea of less can be more. Or following the sometimes Biblical headers in the book: The last shall be first.So why only three stars? Because Gladwell is that sort of author. Pretty predictable, but pretty good at it. And always enjoyable.Follow me on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"

If something appears to be illogical it is simply because our knowledge about it is lacking. Unlike Spock though I embrace a wider spectrum of what constitutes logic, eg emotions are very important and relevant....but otherwise I agree completely with his approach to life.This book is all about situations that don't look logical on the surface, but if you dig a little deeper you discover the logic. To that extent it reminds me slightly of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything - a book I enjoyed enormously. It looks under the surface of things to discover what is really going on.Situations where the underdog does well are explored...some of these include:*David and Goliath. (It turns out David was not the underdog he at first appeared to be...)*The surprising emotional or intellectual strengths that can result from a childhood where loss or scarcity have been experienced.... eg poverty, the loss of a parent, or the experience of dyslexia. Obviously a constructive outcome does not apply to everyone who has undergone these obstacles in life, but it does apply to a surprising number of people.*The importance of equality to levels of happiness. Sometimes very poor countries have a higher rating of happiness than richer countries, where there is greater disparity between people. It is not correct to automatically assume that the people in poorer countries are automatically more unhappy.*Small class sizes in schools are over-rated, sometimes bigger classes are better. (Though there is a cap on size too. Massive classes aren't helpful either.)*Unless you are an absolute genius, it is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond. This applies startlingly to universities. Go to Harvard at your peril.*The experiences of Martin Luther King and his supporters in Birmingham.*The shortcomings of the Three Strikes legal system in California, initiated by Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered in 1992, versus a philosophy of forgiveness, as shown by a Mennonite called Wilma Derksen, whose daughter was also murdered.*The Troubles in Ireland, and how a march by a group of Catholic women managed to undermine the force of the British army.*The extraordinary courage of the people of Le Chambon in France, who sheltered Jewish people in World War 2, and how they managed to get away with it, despite the Germans being aware of what was going on.I found the book interesting, but a little 'bitty' (lots of short pieces about different things.) Some of the situations described interested me more than others, but this is probably only natural. I'm also not convinced of a philosophy of the strength of the underdog. Yes, sometimes it happens, and often it is great when it does, but there are millions of occasions where the winner takes all. There were some fascinating nuggets of information though, and all in all it was an enjoyable read.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Malcolm Gladwell's TED lecture on why David beat Goliathhttp://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_glad...The New York Times review of this book:http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/boo..."
11,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Malcolm Gladwell's books are all in the same style. Gladwell writes interesting anecdotes and then generalizes them, showing common themes, behaviors, or morals. Whether or not these generalizations are valid, his books are vastly entertaining, and this book is no exception. David and Goliath is perhaps the most entertaining book I read this year!In the introduction, Gladwell reviews the biblical story of David and Goliath. The popular conception is that Goliath was a mighty warrior, and David a meek shepherd who was clearly the underdog. Gladwell turns the story around, and by analyzing the biblical verses, he shows that David was not an underdog at all. He had a number of advantages that should have raised his odds of winning.This is the major theme of the book; many apparent disadvantages can turn out to be advantages, while many apparent advantages can turn out to be disadvantageous. Each chapter is a compendium of anecdotes from all spheres of life, that give evidence for this turnabout.Gladwell describes a father who volunteered to be a basketball coach for his daughter's team. Neither the father nor the girls had any experience with basketball. But because he was desperate, the father came up with an atypical strategy that turned the team into a powerhouse.Gladwell shows that although dyslexia is a learning disability, it can help mold a person. A person with dyslexia, given the right aptitudes, can overcome the handicap and excel where other people have lesser abilities. At a meeting of prominent university donors--mostly successful businesspeople, a neuroscientist asked how many had been diagnosed with a learning disorder. Half the hands went up.A medical doctor who had a terrible, traumatic childhood developed a cure for childhood leukemia. Other doctors with normal childhoods were too squeamish to experiment and find such a cure.Gladwell shows that ultra-small class sizes are not always advantageous. Selective, elite schools are not necessarily good for all the students--they might only be good for those students at the very top of the class. He wrote that ""...if you want to see the positive effects of elite schools on self-concept, you are measuring the wrong person. You should be measuring the parents.""The chapter about elite schools follows up with a very interesting observation, that it is better to be a big fish in a ""small pond"" than a little fish in a ""big pond"". As evidence for this, Gladwell cites statistics about college students completing a STEM degree (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). He writes that ""the likelihood of a student completing a STEM degree rises by 2 percentage points for every 10-point decrease in the university's average SAT score."" If you are in a university where many people seem to be smarter than you, it is more likely that you will drop out of a challenging curriculum.Gladwell writes about the apprehension in London before the expected bombing blitz by the Nazis. Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you earn when you've been through the tough times and you discover they aren't so tough after all. He shows how the Germans thought that the bombing would traumatize the city. Instead, it made the British more courageous than ever before.I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology, as a fast, entertaining look at human behavior."
12,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10981935-josh-brock,2,"Malcolm Gladwell is notorious in certain circles for his brand of ""turns out"" pseudo-science writing. The typical structure look something like this: First, he lays out a topic about which there's a certain conventional wisdom. He then proceeds to explain, through a series of anecdotes backed loosely by scientific research, that it ""turns out"" that this conventional wisdom is incorrect. Outliers and The Tipping Point are two previous examples which I thoroughly enjoyed. This book follows that formula, but less successfully than his previous works.Overall, this book was very mediocre. If you thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's other books, you might consider reading this. Otherwise, I'd probably skip it - just read Outliers instead. Gladwell's books have always walked the line between thought-provoking and entertaining on one hand, and over-simplistic and strained on the other hand. This one fell on the wrong side of that line. The stories frequently managed to be entertaining and adequately told, but the link between the stories and the ideas they're supposed to illustrate are frequently far too flimsy to hold up under any kind of scrutiny. Portions of the book, particularly his direct deconstruction of the story of David and Goliath, are even painful to read. I'm not sorry that I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it highly to others."
13,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877389-james,3,"I wrote about my Malcolm Gladwell ambivalence in my What the Dog Saw review. Reading Gladwell has become, for me, the literary equivalent of eating Cheetos or listening to Coldplay - I unequivocally enjoy the experience, but in a vaguely unsatisfying way and I wouldn't want anyone to catch me doing it. His rhetorical stock-in-trade is the reassessment of received wisdom about human behavior examined with respect to such organizing topics as trends, decision-making, success and, in this instance, perceived relative advantage in apparently mismatched conflicts. David and Goliath's argument gets off to a rather clumsy start with a creakily literal-minded 'historical' analysis of the titular metaphor. Gladwell is right about the ubiquity and deadliness of slingers in ancient warfare, but his assertion that Goliath is the warrior 'outgunned' by his opponent (""'Goliath had as much chance against David,' the historian Robert Dohrenwend writes, 'as any Bronze Age warrior with a sword would have had against an [opponent] armed with a .45 automatic.'"") doesn't seem so much a radical reassessment of the mythic conflict as a pedestrian reassertion of its traditional significance. And the claim that the 'historical' Goliath suffered, like Guiness's tallest-man-ever Robert Wadlow, from acromegaly, strikes me as the sort of disturbingly naive literalism I would expect from a televangelist and not a staff science writer for the New Yorker. Does he suppose that the giant in the Jack tales suffered from the malady, as well?But, I quibble. The concepts of relative deprivation and desirable difficulty were convincing if notentirely new, and the analysis of iconic civil rights photographs, particularly the image of teenage Walter Gadsden being 'attacked' by a police dog, was revelatory. Gladwell has a clean, unobtrusive style and a facility for translating arid scientific literature into engaging layman's prose.Can I offer you a Cheeto?"
14,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/10/22...This book is not about underdogs and giants in any conventional sense of these terms. Rather, the book is about the curious nature of advantages and disadvantages, and how each can (under certain circumstances) become its opposite.The first lesson to be learned is that the things we take to be advantages are often no such thing. Our greatest mistake here comes from the fact that we identify a certain quality or characteristic as being a benefit or advantage, and then assume that the more of it there is the better—when this is often not the case. Put another way, most of us recognize that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and yet we fail to appreciate just how often and where this principle applies. For instance, we recognize that having a certain amount of money greatly facilitates raising children (it being very difficult to raise a family in a state of poverty), and yet we fail to recognize that beyond a certain point wealth also makes parenting increasingly difficult (for it becomes harder and harder to instill qualities of hard work and self-control). Or we recognize that small class sizes are a good thing, and yet we fail to recognize that classes can actually begin to suffer once they become too small (since diversity and energy begin to disappear).Another arena wherein an advantage can become a disadvantage is in power and authority. Power and authority is an advantage, of course; however, when it is wielded illegitimately and without fairness, it can actually cause more chaos, destruction and violence than it curbs. This is as true in the classroom as it is in community policing as it is in handling minority groups within a nation’s borders.The second lesson to be learned here is that certain disadvantages can sometimes drive people into positions of advantage. Take the disadvantage of being born with a disability, for example. Say dyslexia. In our modern world, where the ability to read is extremely important—and practically a requirement for success—having great difficulty with reading is a major disadvantage. And indeed the statistics indicate that the vast majority of those who are born dyslexic end up falling through the cracks and missing out on success.Still, though, many dyslexics have gone on to become highly successful people; and it has also been noted that in certain fields (such as entrepreneurship) an inordinate proportion of the most successful individuals do, in fact, have dyslexia. So how can we explain these success stories? What we find in these cases is that these individuals have managed to compensate for their disability by developing skills that make up for their flaws (such as an improved memory or debating prowess). Thus, in a way, the successful dyslexic has actually benefited from his disability, because it has forced him into a position where he has had to develop other skills that have led him directly to success.Also at play here is the fact that dyslexics tend to endure many failures when they are young. Repeated failures (especially at a young age) have the potential to crush the spirit. But they can also have the opposite effect: they can inure the individual to failure, thus making them more likely to take risks and try things that others wouldn’t—which is often a sure path to success.A similar phenomenon also sometimes touches trauma victims. Take the ultimate trauma of losing a parent in childhood, for example. This is one of the worse experiences imaginable, and the trauma of losing a parent in childhood does indeed crush the vast majority of those who have the misfortune of enduring it.Again, though, it has been noted that a very high proportion of highly successful individuals across many fields (from science to art to politics) have in fact lost a parent in childhood. And what we find in these cases is that the experience has left these individuals with the mind-set that now that they have endured such a terrible event, that nothing could ever be so bad. And thus they are liberated from the fear of failure, and—like the successful dyslexic—are willing to try things and take risks that others are not (which often leads directly to success).The same experience and logic can also apply to underdog groups. For example, when a group recognizes that it is severely over-matched in terms of skill or strength compared to its opponent, it can begin to feel liberated to try unconventional tactics and approaches. This is often for the best, for it turns out that unconventional tactics and approaches are frequently very effective against giants—in everything from sports, to politics to war—and are, in many cases, the only chance the underdog has to win anyway. Again, then, in both of these instances (the trauma victim and the underdog group) a disadvantage has driven the party into a position of advantage, and thus the disadvantage may itself be seen as a kind of boon.Gladwell has done well to make us rethink the nature of advantages and disadvantages across many fields. The only major flaw in the book, in my view, is the third and final part. The theme of the part is that power becomes less effective (or even counter-productive) when it is wielded illegitimately. The problem with this argument is that it's a classic case of the straw-man: Gladwell has set up an opposition that is very easy to defeat, and then smashed it to pieces. What's worse is that the examples Gladwell uses to prove his point here are quite weak. Still, there is much of value in the first 2 parts of the book. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/10/22... A podcast discussion of the book will be available shortly thereafter. "
15,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22502969-erika-daniels,2,"I was not impressed. Although I have liked Gladwell's other books, this one was a miss. While I recognize that he finds empirical studies to support the central ideas of his books and am generally okay with that, he went too far with David and Goliath. It was clear that he had a conviction that he wanted to persuade others to adopt and the stories in the book were chosen for that purpose. That part was expected and understandable; the part I couldn't get past was that I have read many of the studies that he cited and disagree with the conclusions. Additionally, he gave a lot of stories to persuade a reader toward his opinion of class size reduction, but nearly all of the studies that supported his claims came from Economics journals. My final complaint is that the stories used to illustrate his central idea felt disjointed and haphazard. All in all, this was not a well-written book that worked toward a coherent conclusion. Such a disappointment."
16,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"As with everything Gladwell, this book is a fun and fast read that is not at all careful with its conclusions. It's not careful scholarship, but Gladwell doesn't claim it to me. In other words, he tells a story with great anecdotes and some data that doesn't always support the point he is making. However, I believe the point he is making in David and Goliath (that underdogs can have hidden strengths and that trials and tragedy can lead to strong character). The point is valid and the stories are riveting. As with all of his books, I learned a lot about some key historical figures as well as some key historical events and came away with a different perspective on my own assumptions. It was also an inspiring read and the stories were really well-written. But of course, I think he over-reaches in many of his conclusions. "
17,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1105868-ryan,3,"Chicken Soup for the Pop Psychologist's Soul. Or something like that.The plural of anecdote is not data. And when Mr. Gladwell has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. That is, he is a very persuasive writer, but ultimately I'm not really convinced about all of his conclusions. Do I need to point out that as social science goes, this is heavy on the social and light on the science? You probably already knew that.Anyway, I did enjoy this one. Everyone loves an underdog. And I enjoyed his retelling of certain historical events and eras. It makes me want to go back and do my own research on some of those stories to see how much of the telling is Gladwell's and how much is actually history.I listened to this on audiobook, and Gladwell narrated. Excellent choice."
18,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Malcolm Gladwell Surprises AgainEver since I read Malcolm Gladwell’s breakthrough book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, I’ve been unable to resist any new book from this most devilishly clever of nonfiction writers. Gladwell’s mind doesn’t seem to work the way mine does, and, unless you’re remarkably eccentric, I suspect the same could be said of you.David and Goliath is an excellent case in point. You might assume, as I so naturally did, that the Biblical tale of David and Goliath illustrates how the weak can overcome the strong. Certainly, that was how I was taught it as a child, and nothing I’ve learned since has led me to think otherwise. Leave it to Malcolm Gladwell to demonstrate that in reality this oft-told story demonstrates precisely the opposite. According to Gladwell (and to the numerous academic researchers whose work he cites), Goliath was massively vulnerable — in large part precisely because he was truly a giant — and David possessed an enormous advantage in his own right from the moment he walked onto the field of battle. The outcome of the battle was foreordained. Goliath’s great strength was in fact no advantage at all.In this out-of-left-field manner, Gladwell draws diverse examples from all over the map to illustrate his principal points: overwhelming power can easily prove to be a disadvantage, while disability and weakness can lead to surprising success. Gladwell writes about how dyslexia has proven to be the hidden key to success among a great many highly successful people, including such notables as Richard Branson and Charles Schwab. Other examples in David and Goliath include the coach of an untalented middle-school girls’ basketball team who led them to a national championship by virtue of a strategy born of his ignorance of basketball, to K-12 teachers who demonstrate how small classes can be disadvantageous and big classes sometimes much better, to the British troops sent to quell the Irish Troubles, only to discover that their exercise of power backfired horribly.David and Goliath is endlessly fascinating. It’s fully worthy of Malcolm Gladwell’s outstanding talent to illuminate our world in surprising ways."
19,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry,2,"Gladwell Dropped the RockI read this upon its publication a few years ago. I was disappointed because it was a real drop-off from Gladwell's previous books, such as Outliers: The Story of Success and, to a lesser degree, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. A few of his anecdotes, for example those relating to schooling, seemed a real stretch to support the book's theme of David v. Goliath. At times, it felt like he'd found some unrelated stories and tried to cobble them into a proof of his hypothesis.I still appreciate Gladwell's work and his contribution to American letters. This appears to be an aberration."
20,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,4,"I stayed up reading this book until I finished it, not only because I'm currently five books behind schedule and I just had two very big cups of tea, but also because this book, like most of Gladwell's other books, is very readable and engaging. Well at least it was to me! I am of course, aware of the criticism this book has received, and I agree that his arguments should be taken... well, not very seriously. But even so, I still believe much of his arguments will hold, at least partially. Gladwell sees things differently, and that is also one of the reasons why I enjoy reading his books! He has this thing were he can put a bunch of stuff together and come up with brilliant conclusions. I love that! I struggled whether I should give this one five stars or four. It actually does matter to me! Stars aren't for free now are they?! I'm going to give this one four stars anyways. Off to read more of Gladwell soon enough! "
21,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63911735-adam-mohd-noor,4,"An intriguing and fascinating read which lets readers to travel through colourful case studies about characters ranging from misfits to underdogs who had overturned their difficulties and challenges in their respective social environments and naturalattributes i.e. difficult childhood, dyslexia, racial segregations etc. More importantly, Gladwell examines WHY underdogs succeed when odds are totally against them. A wonderful counterintuitive exploration combining Gladwell's crafty, intoxicating storytelling with fascinating facts regarding cancer treatment, Battle of Britain, civil right movements and admission into elite institutions. This book also serves an inspiring read for those who are struggling through bad times and inturn, teaches us to harness our disadvantages and compensate/consolidate it with our other strengths. For example, Gary Cohn (the former president and CEO of Goldman Sachs) was diagnosed with dyslexia."
22,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29983165-my-strange-reading,3,RTC but that was my least favorite of Gladwell's books which is a bummer because his message/heart was intriguing. 
23,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6602830-sarah,1,"This is the kind of book I would normally dismiss immediately, but as a book club pick I gave it a shot. I started with a sample on my kindle, but after falling asleep several times reading that I transitioned to audio-book so I could listen while driving. At about 3 chapters in, I wanted to quit. Both the content and the style of writing were the opposite of interesting to me. Obviously the author is trying to make a point and I understood that all of the anecdotal comparisons should be leading me towards a conclusion of some kind. But either I'm too dense, or it's too obvious. Because I have no idea what this book is about. Story after story circles back making loose comparisons without much progression. Bibles and basketball to class size and Impressionism. And on my side, a nap while trying to give it a listen on a Saturday afternoon. After waking up... fish and ponds, and then dyslexia and so called ""desirable difficulties"". Whoa. Note that some of the stories are interesting in themselves, but I think that the connections Gladwell is trying to make to prove his point are tenuous at best. They could also just be coincidences. Yes some people are successful despite overcoming difficulties, but many are not. When he does make a point it seems almost a ""gotcha"" moment as you're wrapping up one story and he suddenly circles you back to something covered a chapter ago and tries to make a connection... Maybe these times were an AHA moment for some, but I continued to be unimpressed. Over halfway through was giving this a fair shake, I think, and turned my attentions to more interesting activities. But then I just had to finish. I knew if I really wanted to write this review it had to be with a full knowledge of what the book entailed. Apparently these books are popular because they translate the social sciences to the masses. And while I do think social sciences are interesting, results of these types of studies can be easily manipulated to make a point. The Wall Street Journal's review sums it up nicely, ""Malcolm Gladwell too often presents as proven laws what are just intriguing possibilities and musings about human behavior.""The notion that a rule holds true except for when it doesn't runs through David and Goliath.You can't make 300 pages out of interesting possibilities and musings. At least not one I want to read. It seems to me that while there might be some bits to learn here, the whole thing is strung together with such tenuous threads it's hard to take any of it seriously. "
24,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2057405-yukari-watanabe,4,"As you can guess from the title, this is the book about how underdogs break the rules and defeat the privileged. As usual, Gladwell introduced many interesting examples to show his points.The story I liked best was the one about the middle school girl basketball team coached by an Indian businessman Vivek Ranadivé. Ranadivé knew nothing about basketball and his team was made up with short nerdy girls. But he managed to bring his team to the national championship. Gladwell explained the strategies Ranadivé used which lead his team to unthinkable victories. They are interesting enough, but there must be more which contribute to Ranadivé's remarkable achievement. I wish Gladwell went deeper than this.In his last book Outliers: The Story of Success, Gladwell introduced ""the 10,000hr rule"" as ""a key in success"". I thought it was an overly simplified conclusion, and I strongly disagreed with it. I felt the same way about this DAVID AND GOLIATH. It could be even harmful if you take his conclusions as the definite truth.Having said that, this is an encouraging book for underdogs who have dyslexia or hard childhood. Gladwell is a great story teller, and I always admire and enjoy his writing. "
25,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3010986-amanda-patterson,4,"Malcolm Gladwell shows why you don't always have to be Goliath to win. He explains why places such as a rebellious Northern Ireland, London during the Blitz, Birmingham in the American Civil Rights Movement, and a small town in Nazi occupied France, were able to triumph over stronger opponents. We meet remarkable underdogs like Jay Freireich, the doctor who revolutionised treatment for children with leukaemia, and David Boies, a dyslexic trial attorney, who shouldn't have triumphed but did. Gladwell has a talent for presenting interesting subject matter in an entertaining way. He is an astute observer of the human condition. I love the way that he makes people think with his research and observations. He does not present his writing as fact but rather as a tool to engage people.Bigger isn't always better. Neither is smaller. Read David and Goliath to find out why."
26,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,3,"“Giants are not what we think they are. The same qualities that appear to give them strength are often the sources of great weakness.”Big insights are rare commodities. Unless, that is, you happen to be cycling through Gladwell territory, where tucked away inside every myth, anecdote or counterintuitive result is a profound lesson about the human condition. This is harmless enough when confined to the fiction aisles of your local library, but Gladwell presents his ideas as scientifically respectable, even moving (well) beyond the academic literature and into high-concept generalization. And this is what gets him in the hot seat.By now we're all familiar with Gladwell's tried and true formula: packaging a mixed bag of vignettes that loosely revolve around some common theme. His latest book, eponymous with the biblical tale implanted in every child's vocabulary, serves as the hub with which his assorted case studies can network. The humble stone-slinger slays the mighty warrior–the archetypal underdog story. Except Gladwell upends this classic tale and contends that any ostensible disadvantages on the part of David were actually aptitudes, and vice versa for Goliath. After some offbeat meta-analysis of the Hebrew account, he intones the book's central theme:“There is a set of advantages that have to do with material resources, and there is a set that have to do with the absence of material resources – and the reason underdogs win as often as they do is that the latter is sometimes every bit the equal of the former.” (pp. 24-25)Now there's a heartwarming idea giftwrapped in persuasive prose. One of Time's most influential people of 2005, Gladwell's ability to craft absorbing narrative merits the lavish acclaim from the popular press, but the accolades stop there. His cultivated habit of extrapolating grand truths from flimsy research has proved time and again his Achilles' heel. The anecdotes he recounts stand by themselves and gain nothing by being tangled in with pop-psychology, especially when there is actual peer-reviewed research into many of the areas Gladwell touches. Gladwell leans all of his weight on a small-sampled (read: underpowered) study which found that less legible fonts activated higher performance in students, presumably because the students worked through the problems more slowly in order to decode the typeface. Yet, as psychology professor Christopher F. Chabris points out, Gladwell conveniently omits any reference to the replication studies (of superior statistical power) that failed to reproduce this result. That the study Gladwell makes such heavy weather of is plagued with sampling, selection effect and other confounds does not bode well for his thesis.Pesky details are of trifling importance to Gladwell, who steers the data in directions both cliched and maudlin. Were we to find life on the moons of Saturn, he would undoubtedly apply his guiding principles there as well; so sure is Gladwell that this obscure study holds the key to overcoming life’s obstacles that he applies it to dyslexia, claiming that inbuilt disadvantages generate asymmetrical success stories. Replication results notwithstanding, are we to really believe that the authors of the typeface study suppose their findings reveal some deep lesson about turning adversity into triumph? Gladwell may be a lot of things but mantic isn’t one of them. You could fill a supertanker with all of the sociological and psychological layers pushed to the periphery in favor of his handpicked fiction.The balance of his thesis rests on self-reported anecdote by real-life Davids who faced down their own Goliaths. There is nothing so prescient as hindsight, especially when other factors stab at the provocative narrative hanging in the balance. Complications be damned: it can only be adversity that produces successful outcomes which, curiously, seems to knock against his thesis in Outliers (2008), which replaces adversity with caprice and right-place right-timeness. How many rabbits will he pull out of the same hat before even his unsuspecting readership cry foul?And it gets worse for Gladwell. One need not inventory his entire catalog, as his scuffles with internal contradiction can be found in adjoining chapters of David and Goliath. After tagging dyslexia as a ""desirable difficulty"" that breeds success, he juxtaposes a story about a would-be scientist who dropped out of school because she encountered undesirable difficulties at a renowned university. By relying on Gladwell's vacuum-packed logic of the preceding chapters, one is left scratching his head as to why the ""small-fish-big-pond"" schematic wasn't parlayed into the successes afforded the world's dyslexics. For Gladwell, it seems, difficulty is a good thing until it isn't, which smells as fallacy-laden as the aphorism 'If you're not early you're late.'Or as Christopher Chabris puts it in his blue-chip review in the Wall Street Journal:
""The idea that difficulty is good when it helps you and bad when it doesn't is no great insight.""
Even his deconstruction of the David and Goliath bout diverges from the core theme he attempts to build throughout the book. Gladwell tells us plainly that David actually had the sizable advantage since lithe marksmen were always favored over cumbrous infantrymen clad in heavy armor. Within the conventional confines of ancient warfare, it was Goliath who was the decided underdog. Why then did this strategic imbalance, along with his hypothesized acromegaly condition, not spur Goliath to victory as it did the dyslexic CEOs or Vivek Ranadivé’s middle school basketball team, or steel his resolve as with the near-miss survivors during the Battle of Britain?For a more hyperbolic but just as on-target commentary, see Daniel Engber's review in Slate:
""The notion that a rule holds true except for when it doesn’t runs through David and Goliath, and insulates its arguments from deep interrogation. Is it really advantageous to have severe dyslexia? Yes, and certainly not. Are children better off without their parents? Don’t be silly, but it could be so. These non-answers rub the dazzle from Gladwell’s clever thesis statements, until they all begin to look like dullish intuition. We don’t need another book to tell us that adversity can lead to greatness (see: memoirs by CEOs, episodes of The Moth, every college essay ever written), just as we don’t need another book to say that adversity really, really sucks (see: the world outside your window). But couched in the golden armor of anecdote, Gladwell’s overgrown ideas seem powerful and new.""
What's perhaps most unforgivable about Gladwell's tactics is that he, whether wittingly or no, ignores the relevant research into the very topics he covers. For example, why not mention the ongoing research on the comparative value of attending elite vs. non-elite schools? Why not discuss the actual research on age-specific impairments of dyslexia? Or why not, even if only in one of his many footnotes, source the relevant literature for the science behind ""desirable difficulty""? [1] [2] Probably because this complicates the narrative. But drawing on unrelated research that supports your thesis at a minimally conceptual level while ignoring the more relevant research extant is what we call cherry-picking. Subsequently presenting this research as though it models macroscale principles about the nature of reality is shifty behavior, to put it mildly.Closing ThoughtsEven with the outpouring of negative reaction from various quarters of the blogosphere, Gladwell's literary talents remain as agile as ever. His ability to locate and draw out the most moving aspects of the human stories he collects is on full display here. But this savoriness is perpetually undermined by his messy forays into social science, in which he scavenges the academic literature for nuggets that can be spun into a thematic web. In David and Goliath this web frequently unravels into muddled contradiction. The quickening stories he inflects through fluid prose work well on their own, even in their romanticized state, but Gladwell seems unable to fight the compulsion to reach for obscure, underpowered, unreplicated studies to which he can fasten his larger than life lessons. Despite this awkward matrimony often borne out in the pages of his books, I suspect most readers are none too interested in Gladwell's fidelity to scientific wisdom but rather are lulled by the melody around which all good storytelling harmonizes.Note: This review is republished from my official website.

27,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19072481-s-baqer-al-meshqab,4,"The art of storytelling is quite powerful, especially - perhaps for history freaks like me - if it demonstrates an event from ancient times to deliver and idea in the most interesting and outstanding way. The Event: The war between the Israelites and the Philistines, in the the valley of Elah, during which a Confrontation between David - a young small weak looking boy - and Goliath - a fearsome giant, took place and marked an end of an era, and a start of a legend. Naturally, one would think that David has no chance of winning the battle, but history says otherwise. Why? because apparently the boarder line between what we call advantages and disadvantages is not as clear as we think it is. The Israelites looked at the sturdy giant armored body of their enemy as the greatest advantage he could ever have, where in fact, it led to his demise. Interested to know how? Give the book a try. It is definitely a good read. The author mainly takes this example as a model upon which other social experiences and events can be based. The main idea: No matter how undesired a difficulty you are faced with, unknowingly, it could lead to your success. One example Gladewell tackles is dyslexia, which is the difficulty of reading and comprehending texts. Dyslexic kids are at a huge disadvantage: they cannot keep up with their class, and their future is - as society judges - is decided. Then how come, one kid who was cursed with such a thing, was able to climb the ladder of success and become one of the most notable lawyers is his entire country? It is precisely because of dyslexia. Now, is it really a curse? and knowing that, would we ever wish dyslexia, or any other undesired difficulty upon our children if we knew it could lead to their success (or couldn't)? David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants is a great book. No Giant will even feel as Giant after reading this book. Everything can be confronted with the most unexpected ways. "
28,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1696949-j-f-penn,4,"Interesting essays from Gladwell about how the underdog can win, but MORE about the way we believe certain things to be true, but they're actually not. For example, David would always have beat Goliath as he broke the rules of 1:1 combat, choosing a weapon equivalent to a gun over a sword. It was essentially an unfair fight - but we celebrate David's winning against the odds, when in fact, we should celebrate breaking the rules and winning that way. There's a lot about the misconceptions around education and crime stats as well, for example, it's better to have more kids in a classroom, up to a certain size, rather than too few. And too much punishment for crime doesn't work, whereas positive support can change an area, reducing crime. This is another important book by Gladwell and makes you think about the things we assume are ""common sense"" or ""common knowledge"". "
29,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"Just realized this was my 5th Gladwell book, and I've rated them all 4 stars.They are all equally interesting and provide a sweeping look at a wide range of topics. *However* my only criticism is the same for this book as for all his others — they are extremely random and the ""conclusions"" are not always very solid. Bit of a stretch in many parts, but still very entertaining.After all, who doesn't love a good underdog story!? “Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you earn when you’ve been through the tough times and you discover they aren’t so tough after all.”“Giants are not what we think they are. The same qualities that appear to give them strength are often the sources of great weakness.”“As the playwright George Bernard Shaw once put it: 'The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.'"""

I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
32,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

35,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "
36,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18823859-makiko-shinoda,4,"It was really hard to put down the book once I started reading. Malcolm Gladwell is such a great storyteller. I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

39,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
40,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

43,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
44,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
45,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
46,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
47,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
48,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
49,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
50,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
51,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
52,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."

54,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
55,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
56,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"

He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
60,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
62,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

65,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "

I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

69,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
70,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So five stars for that.But: he is not always accurate in his chains of arguments and he often confuses causality with correlation. So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "

If you HAVEN'T read Gladwell before, then I definitely think he is worth picking up. While I don't always agree with his conclusions as being hard facts, I think his views on society are really interesting and definitely can provoke some great conversations. It is worth it for that alone. "
73,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
74,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
75,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
76,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
77,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
78,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
79,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
80,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
81,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."

The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining.

84,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
85,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."

I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
87,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
90,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
92,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

95,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "

I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

99,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
100,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So five stars for that.But: he is not always accurate in his chains of arguments and he often confuses causality with correlation. So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "
102,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,3,"If you have read Malcolm Gladwell before, you'll feel the same way about this book that you feel about his other work. If you HAVEN'T read Gladwell before, then I definitely think he is worth picking up. While I don't always agree with his conclusions as being hard facts, I think his views on society are really interesting and definitely can provoke some great conversations. It is worth it for that alone. "
103,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
104,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
105,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
106,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
107,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
108,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
109,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
110,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
111,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."

The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."

114,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
115,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
116,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
117,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
120,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
122,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

125,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "

I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts.

129,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
130,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So five stars for that.But: he is not always accurate in his chains of arguments and he often confuses causality with correlation. So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "

If you HAVEN'T read Gladwell before, then I definitely think he is worth picking up. While I don't always agree with his conclusions as being hard facts, I think his views on society are really interesting and definitely can provoke some great conversations. It is worth it for that alone. "
133,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
134,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
135,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
136,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
137,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
138,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
139,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
140,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
141,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
142,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."

144,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
145,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
146,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
147,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"

I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
152,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

155,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "

I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts.

159,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
160,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "

163,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
164,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
165,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
166,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
167,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
168,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
169,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
170,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
171,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
172,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."
173,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam,5,"A fascinating look at the underdogs and unexpected achievers in our midst. If you have ever wanted to make what seems like a disadvantage into an advantage, this is your book. "
174,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
175,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
176,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
177,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
180,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
182,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

185,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "
186,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18823859-makiko-shinoda,4,"It was really hard to put down the book once I started reading. Malcolm Gladwell is such a great storyteller. I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic. Even then, I strongly recommend this book for the pure pleasure of indulging yourself in Gladwell's storytelling, and for the ample food for thought he proposes."

Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

189,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
190,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."
191,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21384414-franziska,4,"I really enjoy his style of writing and the little stories he tells to make his points. So five stars for that.But: he is not always accurate in his chains of arguments and he often confuses causality with correlation. So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "

If you HAVEN'T read Gladwell before, then I definitely think he is worth picking up. While I don't always agree with his conclusions as being hard facts, I think his views on society are really interesting and definitely can provoke some great conversations. It is worth it for that alone. "
193,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
194,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
195,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
196,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
197,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
198,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
199,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
200,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
201,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
202,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."
203,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam,5,"A fascinating look at the underdogs and unexpected achievers in our midst. If you have ever wanted to make what seems like a disadvantage into an advantage, this is your book. "
204,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
205,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
206,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
207,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"

I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

212,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

214,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,5,I really enjoyed this one - thought provoking and interesting. Highly recommended
215,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "
216,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18823859-makiko-shinoda,4,"It was really hard to put down the book once I started reading. Malcolm Gladwell is such a great storyteller. I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic. Even then, I strongly recommend this book for the pure pleasure of indulging yourself in Gladwell's storytelling, and for the ample food for thought he proposes."
217,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55506205-alexia,3,"As far as non-fiction goes, I did quite enjoy it. Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

219,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
220,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know.

It is worth it for that alone. "
223,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
224,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
225,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
226,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
227,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
228,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
229,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
230,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
231,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
232,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."
233,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam,5,"A fascinating look at the underdogs and unexpected achievers in our midst. If you have ever wanted to make what seems like a disadvantage into an advantage, this is your book. "
234,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
235,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
236,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"
237,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15648511-fahad-naeem,1,"David and Goliath was amongst the worst books Malcolm Gladwell had written. He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."
239,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,4," Updated November 2019 I decided to re-read this book as a reminder to myself that Bigger is not always better and to get an understanding of how I can better battle some of the giants in my life. A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
240,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
242,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

244,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,5,I really enjoyed this one - thought provoking and interesting. Highly recommended
245,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "
246,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18823859-makiko-shinoda,4,"It was really hard to put down the book once I started reading. Malcolm Gladwell is such a great storyteller. I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic. Even then, I strongly recommend this book for the pure pleasure of indulging yourself in Gladwell's storytelling, and for the ample food for thought he proposes."
247,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55506205-alexia,3,"As far as non-fiction goes, I did quite enjoy it. Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

249,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
250,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know.

It is worth it for that alone. "
253,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
254,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
255,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
256,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
257,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
258,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
259,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
260,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
261,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."
262,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,3,"I bought and started reading this book in the face of an hour long trip with no reading material. The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining. And despite all the laziness the deftness and vividness of the story telling make the observations of more is less surprisingly sticky despite the banality of it all."

264,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."
265,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"I confess that while I had enjoyed Gladwell's previous books very much, I had shied away from this one because of the decidedly mixed reviews -- but a friend recently encouraged me to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."
266,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829437-becca,5,"What can I say about this? Read it. I'll probably find a hard copy of this and mark it up and read it many times over. I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"

He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."

A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
270,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,1,"First, a confession: I couldn't finish this book. I just couldn't continue to torture myself with the ridiculously poor science, terminal confusion of causation and correlation, factual incorrectness, and shear immorality of the thing.This book is an appalling, unscrupulous mess. The entire thing, as far as I can tell, is about finding an advantage by working within the letter of the law by violating its spirit. The first few chapters are filled with ways in which the ""underdog"" found some unique advantage to defeat their opponents. You know - like the way corporations find unique ways to hide their money outside the United States so they don't have to pay taxes. Or the way rich people find unique ways to claim deductions to lower their debt obligations. Or the way police find unique ways to charge the innocent so they can increase their arrest records. Or the way high frequency hedge fund traders find unique ways to break the system so they can turn a quick profit.When Gladwell started saying that you shouldn't always go to the best college that accepts you because there are going to be people there smarter than you and you'll feel stupid and drop out, I realized he's a complete moron. When he said that since the smartest people go to Harvard then EVERYONE at Harvard should be getting straight A's because they're all really smart... right? Right?!? I realized he shouldn't be allowed out of the house without a helmet.This is a trophy-for-playing manifesto with guidelines for how to get your trophy by cheating the system. It's pathetic."

I loved everything about it, his writing style and the points of view he shares for each situation or scenario. I am very impressed with the way he is able to give unbiased perspective and lets the readers come to their own conclusions. He is a brilliant writer. I will be reading much more of his work. "
272,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,4,"Let me ask you a series of questions:Can a team with only mediocre offensive skills and limited physical gifts regularly beat teams that are more talented?Are larger classes sometimes better for learning than smaller ones?Might an accomplished young woman interested in science find career success by attending a state university instead of the Ivy League school that admitted her?Might a guy with dyslexia (a serious disorder that affects reading ability) do well in a legal career?Can a physician with a very troubled youth develop a breakthrough protocol for treating a fatal childhood disease by ignoring colleagues and forcing patients (and parents) to push through the pain?Can an oppressed minority gain rights and dignity through tricking the oppressor into dumb moves?Can the campaign of a heart-broken father to limit crime after the murder of his daughter backfire into promoting more crime?Can forgiveness provide a stable and fulfilling way of responding to horrific loss?Can a small group of dissenters thumb their noses at Vichy and Nazi officials and openly harbor Jews, saving them from internment and death?Can David beat Goliath?If you’ve ever read any Malcolm Gladwell, you will know that the counter-intuitive answers to some of these questions are Gladwell’s answers. Gladwell opens his latest book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants by explaining how David’s victory over Goliath was not so great an upset as we've come to believe. David, as an expert with the sling (not an unusual talent in that time), held a real advantage over the armor-clad, pituitary case (Goliath) that he faced. Like the game of rock-scissors-paper, each strategy entails an effective counter-strategy. So a girls basketball team, coached by an Indian immigrant father with no basketball experience, used the unorthodox strategy of an aggressive full-court press to win games and go the national tournament. (Gladwell journeys into basketball lore to describe the education of Rick Pitino about the value of the press. I must add that the press is under-utilized still. I loved it.) If you don’t have rocks, use paper.As Gladwell often does in his writing, he weaves insights from social science into real life tales, and in doing so, he challenges the easy assumptions we tend to make. In two segments involving education, he challenges a couple of common assumptions, assumptions that cost a lot of money and that have very serious repercussions. First, he explores the assumption that smaller class size always improves student achievement. Gladwell finds that class size, like many things in life, has a sweet spot—a Goldilocks point—that is neither too large nor too small. In smaller classes, there may not be enough variety to facilitate a desired give-and-take for discussion and projects. Thus, the class never reaches its full learning potential. Gladwell concludes (and I intuitively agree) that outstanding teachers are the key to educational success, not simply more teachers. Rather than paying outstanding, experienced teachers to retire early to hire some additional new, untested teachers, we should work to keep outstanding teachers working as long as possible. (Yes, I’m thinking of C, for an example, although she’s still working.)Another very interesting point involving education addresses the issue of college choice. Gladwell uses the instance of a young high-school student interested in science who goes to Brown (an Ivy) rather that her home-state University of Maryland. Because of the intense competition and high-skills range, Gladwell’s young woman abandons science as her major. She tried to make it as a big fish in a big pond, but as statistics show, this is tough. Those who succeed tend to be those who succeed in comparison to their peers in a particular environment, whether at State U or an Ivy League college. For young people making excruciating decisions about where to go to study or where to go to continue playing a sport, this is vital information. (Of course, the Ivy League works well for some, as I know a couple of Ivy League grads whom I think have done quite well.)Another tale that interested me especially was that of David Boies, one of the premier trial and appellate lawyers in the nation. Boies has dyslexia, which makes reading very difficult. To compensate, he learned to learn by listening—listening very carefully. Boies didn’t go to college until a bit later in life. He ended up graduating from Yale Law. (I guess his Ivy League choice worked out okay, too.) One strategy he used in law school was to read the synopsis of a case rather than a whole opinion (a lesson there, I think). And he listened—very carefully. (I suspect that careful listening is a skill that most of us, including lawyers—or especially lawyers?—too often fail to practice.) Boies chose litigation as a field because it didn’t require as much reading as corporate law would have. (Still, there’s still plenty to read in litigation.) Interestingly, unlike most lawyers, Bois doesn’t read for pleasure, either, reporting that he only reads about a book a year. Boies learned to compensate for his disadvantage and by doing so, cultivated skills that allowed him to rise to the top of his field.From the list of questions at the beginning of my review, you can discern some of the other topics Gladwell addresses. Gladwell has mastered this genre. Gladwell, along with Michael Lewis, Daniel Pink, and a few others, has learned how to weave nonfiction narrative into social scientific insights in a manner that is both instructive and entertaining. Gladwell’s counter-intuitive insights and arguments challenge us to consider what things may not work the way that we easily assume they do."

275,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183036-peter,5,"My favorite book of the year.What the world says is ""best"" isn't always whats best. Choose your goals and the rules that govern your life wisely. Try to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise you'll never see anything but how tall your problems are. Instead of how deadly your weapons are. I went from nearly being a High School drop out to graduating from ASU with an electrical engineering degree. I watched dozens of kids much smarter than I drop out or change majors because they got their first academic 'B' and they couldn't handle the ""failure"". If I got a 'C' in college I was ecstatic. Quote form the book...“My upbringing allowed me to be comfortable with failure,” he said. “The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed. And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. Because we’re so accustomed to the downside. It doesn’t faze us. I’ve thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.”The world isn't flat and neither are most of the other things that matter. Too much of a good thing passes the point of diminishing returns until it becomes a hindrance. I didn't expect this book to be religious but he keeps coming back to religious references to prove his points. Those that seem to understand the worlds failings best seem to be those that understand the Bible best. Why do bad things happen to good people? To make them stronger so that they can help others. Don't let others give you an excuse. You can overcome anything. "

I especially enjoyed how he combines and structures several episodes to sculpture the point he wants to get across, and the how vividly he portrays each character.The theme of the book is thought provoking. How do Davids of the world overcome obstacles, and the Goliaths be vulnerable to the underdog at times? I was especially impressed by the emerging thesis in the last one third of the book regarding how use of power requires legitimacy. It reminded me of a teaching by Takaaki Yoshimoto, a Japanese grassroots philosopher and father of Banana Yoshimoto. ""When you think you are doing good, act as though you may be doing wrong. When you think you are doing wrong, act as though you may be doing good."" (See source, though it's in Japanese.) His example is a situation where an old person comes on a crowded commuter train. A younger person gives up his seat for the old person. This is a good act. But what if the younger person appears boastful? Wouldn't it leave a very different impression if the younger person is more reserved, perhaps humble?Source:http://d.hatena.ne.jp/fujipon/20120316http://www.1101.com/readers/2009-10-0...The endnote is quite interesting in of itself, serving as a debrief of the book and a review of other reading material Gladwell recommends.I gave four stars instead of five because I sometimes felt there were jumps in logic.

Of course, the charts and events listed here are all conveniently presented with a light that enhances the author's beliefs: nevertheless, I liked how the author connected diverse short stories to support his theme.Admittedly I did not agree with some of Gladwell's assertions, and some conclusions derived from the stories were too far-fetched to persuade me, but there were a few that made me see events with a different light. Although I am far from incorrigible, it still takes some effort to propel me towards an unfamiliar point of view.But my tolerance for fiction only goes so far. I will very truthfully say that I felt bored with the book in some parts. Enjoyment factor is a very important element in my system for rating books, and therefore I can't rate this book above 3 stars without betraying my conscience.Props to the author for succeeding in making me not quit this book."

279,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15929427-briane-pagel,1,"I came to David and Goliath a bit circuitously. I started reading it last year and got a chapter in before abandoning it for a new book I'd gotten. I only came back to it last week because the loan expired on another book I was reading, and David and Goliath was one of the few audiobooks I was kind of interested in that I could download right away from the library.It wasn't worth the wait. I've been a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's since I read The Tipping Point; I liked that and Outliers because the way they used anecdotal evidence to examine hypotheses and make arguments about their premises was entertaining as well as thought-provoking.David and Goliath, though, suffers from too few examples of Gladwell's premise, or from perhaps his stretching it to try to encompass more than the theory ever could. The book is an argument that what we think of as being an underdog is often incorrect -- that underdogs in fact win more often than the title would suggest. Insofar as that goes, the book's first 1/3 or so is a pretty interesting look at why underdogs aren't really. Gladwell examines the David-vs-Goliath story of the title, noting that not only is David's weapon, a sling, a far more deadly weapon than most people assume (it was about the equivalent of a handgun when used properly) but also suggesting that Goliath himself suffered from various physical ailments that while contributing to his large size left him nearly blind and with difficulty moving. That sets up what seemingly was the premise of the book: that the superior force often hides weaknesses, and the underdog is often only so on the surface. Gladwell then discusses two basketball teams: one, a girls' team in California, the other a mens' college team. Each team had no real skilled players on it, but each managed surprising victories by playing basketball the way it is almost never played: using a full-court press, defending the field from the throw-in to the other end. Through those two stories, Gladwell's work is at least interesting: he suggests that being an underdog means finding gaps in the way conventions favor the powerful, becoming a disruptive force by finding another way -- not necessarily better, overall, but powerful in its unexpectedness-- and succeeding in that other way.Then the book goes off the rails, eventually ending dismally, both in terms of the story and in any coherent examination of the idea. Gladwell walks through a terrible example of a rich man discussing the difficulty he has raising his children because he can't teach them the value of a dollar. As a guy who is not rich and who wholeheartedly believes that we should simply allow the government to take away any income a person earns about $200,000 per year, I am not sympathetic to a guy feeling bad because when his kid asks for something he can't simply lie and say we don't have the money. The argument both trivializes the problems poor parents have and completely fails to fit the theory Gladwell spent a few chapters setting up. Gladwell uses the rich man's dilemma to set up what he calls the ""U Curve"" of advantage, arguing that as something increases, it eventually hits a point where the advantages level off and eventually fall back to being disadvantages: the rich man finds wealth an advantage, as he gets richer and richer -- but when he gets too rich, it becomes a disadvantage because it poses an impediment to not giving in to his children.The ""Bell Curve"" theory is one of the dumbest theories that exists. The ""Bell Curve"" or something similar has been used to artificially lower people's grades, and to alter American economics forever. Grading on a ""curve"" is terrible: it makes people failures simply for not being as smart as the other people taking the test. In a ""curve"" grading, you take the best performance and artificially label that an ""A."" From there you simply spread people down, marking the next lowest a ""B"" and so on. The problem with this is that it presupposes that everyone cannot get an ""A"", and also that the best work is an ""A.""Consider: 5 people take a 100-question test. Person A gets 100% correct. Person B gets 99, C gets 98, and so on to D (97) and E (96). All of them got fewer than 5 questions wrong -- but Person E fails the test.What if A gets an 80, B a 75, C a 70, D a 65, and E a 60? Person A still gets an A, down to E, who fails -- even though A did 20 points less in this example. Grading on a curve isn't as bad as the ""Laffer Curve,"" which continues to infect policy today. Laffer was the one who drew a napkin curve for Ronald Reagan and convinced policymakers that taxes can be too high on the rich and that higher taxes are a disincentive for wealth accumulation. Tax rates were promptly cut for the rich and today the economic imbalance is poised to destroy society. The highest marginal tax rate in the US in 1979 was 70%; in 1979, a wealthy person would have paid 70% taxes on the very uppermost of his taxes. In 1979 there were one billionaire and 450,000 millionaires in the United States.In 2016, the highest marginal tax rate is 39.6%, and applies only to income above about $400,000 per year; the rich pay 39.6% of every dollar they earn above $400,000. There are 536 billionaires in the United States, and 10,100,000 millionaires.In that time, inflation has about tripled, so a million dollars in 1979 is the equivalent of $3,000,000 in 2016. In other words, thanks to the Laffer Curve, the increase in billionaires has been accelerated by a factor of 536. Nobody should argue that a ""bell curve"" actually makes sense, in any way. Throughout the book I kept trying to picture the graph a particular 'bell curve' would fit on -- what would be the X axis? What would be the Y? Gladwell doesn't explain, and probably can't because ""Bell Curves"" are not something that actually exist and should not be used to try to explain anything.That doesn't deter Gladwell from stretching his theory far beyond the breaking point. He examines, cleverly, the difference between smart people at good schools and smart people at what are considered ""poor"" schools, to note that you have a better chance of getting a good job and a degree if you are a reasonably smart person at a state school than if you are a very smart person at a 'good' school. Gladwell argues that this is due solely to what he calls the ""little fish big pond"" theory: the very smart are little fish in a big pond at places like Harvard, but are big fish in a little pond at state schools. As a theory, it's too simplistic: it supposes that everyone reacts to competition in the exact same way, with too little evidence of that. It also does not make clear which is the Goliath here: Harvard? Very smart people?From there it's even more downhill: Gladwell suggests that people with dyslexia, people who lose a parent, or who lose a child, are all examples of underdogs who owe their successes, in part to the 'disadvantage' of the one big problem in their life. But taking dyslexia and noting that many successful people have it is the same as noting that most US Presidents have been left-handed: So what? The sample size is too small, and by hand-selecting his examples Gladwell deprives them of any scientific worth. He ignores the many successful people who read just fine, and attributes far too many qualities to a simple genesis.This alone isn't that bad: it's what Gladwell does in his other books, and his articles in The New Yorker: it's more a way of thinking than it is an application of actual science. But here, more than I recall in his other books, Gladwell presents this as gospel. You wouldn't wish your child to have dyslexia, Gladwell says several times in the book Or would you? The book says he doesn't think you should wish that but the impetus of the argument is that, yeah, you should.It's in the final 1/3 that I lost patience with the book. Gladwell seems to completely abandon David and Goliath and begins talking about power, and whether power can be exercised without legitimacy. He spends chapters on detailed discussions of the Irish troubles in the 1970s and 1980s without any real explanation of why the detail is there. I got the feeling that he was required to hit a certain page count by his publisher, and so he padded it out. The idea of these chapters is that power if exercised without legitimacy is always bad-- but Gladwell provides no true examples of power exercised with legitimacy, and at times confuses the issue with a discussion of people being outsiders. I won't even get into that; it should have been edited out of the book.Gladwell compares, for his power argument, two families, each of whom had a child murdered. One family, in California, used the event to help spur the famous ""Three Strikes"" rule in California that imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence on repeat offenders. Gladwell notes that this resulted in a boom in prison population and only a temporary reduction of crime. The other family, a Canadian family, opted not to attempt to do that, instead, making a statement at the press conference when their daughter's body was found to the effect that they were going to try to forgive the man. Gladwell points to the latter family as one that exercised power with legitimacy, but doesn't explain what power they exercised, at all -- or why the same power was exercised illegitimately in California.Gladwell seems to think that because ""Three Strikes"" failed as a social remedy, that the man who got it passed had used his power without any legitimate backing from society; that's not true, though: it confuses the end result with the reason for its existence. It's not necessarily correct to judge a decision solely by its outcome. As I like to point out: the decision to go for it on 4th-and-goal in a football game is either a good one or bad one, before the ball is snapped. Making the touchdown doesn't legitimize the call, and missing it doesn't make the call a bad one. Gladwell doesn't explain why ""Three Strikes"" was an exercise in illegitimate power mongering; he simply compares it to the British overreaction that led to the Irish Troubles without any real linkage.(The example Gladwell uses of what brought ""Three Strikes"" to an end is itself an example of fuzzy thinking. The case that led to a public backlash against the policy was one involving a defendant who had stolen a slice of pizza from some kids. The defendant had five prior felony convictions and so was sentenced to 25-to-life. The story was widely reported with such headlines as ""Stealing One Slice of Pizza Gets Life Sentence."" The actual story was more complicated: Very few of the papers printed what the five priors were. They were robbery, armed robbery, drug possession and ""unauthorized use of a vehicle."" If the defendant had done those crimes in a different order, it's likely that the public wouldn't have cared: suppose the first crime was the pizza one, and the last was armed robbery. Would the headline ""Armed Robber Gets 25-years-to-life"" draw much attention? I doubt it. It was not the slice of pizza alone that sent the man to jail; it was that it was his sixth crime, at least five of which were very serious. Gladwell doesn't discuss that much.)(I should note that I am against ""Three Strikes"" and mandatory sentencing laws, but that's for another day.)In the end, David and Goliath would have made a pretty interesting magazine article; by stretching his thesis to book length, all Gladwell did was water it down with a seemingly-random set of arguments about how people rose above their circumstances. It's tempting to say something snarky about Gladwell himself; his earlier nonfiction books have made him something of a Goliath in this field of writing, and his book shows all the supposed frailties of what he argues as a typical Goliath -- while also being equally unsuccessful. It's neither a coherent book nor a particularly good one -- and ends up making the basic idea behind it suffer from a similar lack of coherence and validity."
280,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,2,"Ay ... Gladwell, why do you keep writing these silly books. And wait, why do I keep reading them?Once again, we get a Gladwell book with a bold -- shamelessly bold? -- premise, only to find that support for the premise takes the form of anecdotes and interesting factoids. But not much in the way of convincing data or argumentation.In fact, his premise is forgotten almost immediately -- it quickly becomes less about ""How little guys can beat the big guys"" and becomes the fuzzier ""what seems like advantages are sometimes not actually advantages"", which, like a lot of Gladwell's work, falls neatly into the ""no shit"" category. Obviously this fuzzier, less bold, less defined topic is easier to cherry-pick supporting examples for.The most interesting section of the book actually is the first one, which is the one dedicated to the David and Goliath story. The short version: a sling in the hand of a trained slinger was about as deadly as a modern-day hand-pistol, so why should anyone have been surprised when David killed Goliath? Gladwell argues that they wouldn't have been, that in fact the surprising part was David's subversion of the conventions of one-on-one combat of his time, which dictated that such encounters were fought with heavy armor and non-projectile weaponry. And this subversion of assumptions, he further argues, is how the little guy tends to beat the big guy.And there, right after that promising start, is where the deep insights end."

So five stars for that.But: he is not always accurate in his chains of arguments and he often confuses causality with correlation. So two stars for that.What he says is interesting, but he needs a lot of words to say so little. Three stars.One of his main assets I think is his ability to change how we see things, to give us new perspectives on things that we think we already know. That's what I really enjoy and why in my opinion his books are definitely worth reading. Five stars for that.And five stars for the idea of the desirable difficulty that suggests that not all difficulties are negative. It makes sense to me. "

If you HAVEN'T read Gladwell before, then I definitely think he is worth picking up. While I don't always agree with his conclusions as being hard facts, I think his views on society are really interesting and definitely can provoke some great conversations. It is worth it for that alone. "
283,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,3,"Can nonfiction books have spoilers? I think they have a thesis which must be defended through arguments. This review critiques those arguments, so I guess, spoiler alert.The title of this book alludes to its thesis: namely, that the underdogs in this world may not be so disadvantaged, while the Goliaths may not have the advantages we assume them to have. I commend this book for curious ideas, but as with any persuasive text, the author must support his or her argument, which the reader then digests and critiques: ""what of it?"" Have I been convinced or not? Unfortunately, while I felt the main tenets of gladwells thesis were put forward well--that is, the small may not be so small and the large are not so large--Gladwell's execution of his arguments contains serious methodological and scientific flaws. Notwithstanding that, his stories tug on my heart strings and it reads fluidly. So, 3 stars for his excellent ability to put stimulate thought and curiosity into the popular stream with moving writing, but not more given the weak validity of his claims. The rest of this review is chapter by chapter commentary and critique. David & Goliath:Sets up frame of mind that what we think of as advantages and disadvantages may not actually be so. Vivek Ranadive:Makes a good point about the inertia of large groups. Being big makes it tough to move quickly, as per the story of Lawrence and the Turks. Similarly, I thought it was a fair point that underdog David's often have to get scrappy and unconventional to defeat Goliaths, which are not so powerful as we think they are. Good chapter. Teresa DeBrito (class size and student achievement):Here's where a lot of issues in his arguments falter. First, they are extremely anecdotal--please support your arguments with empirical work. Gladwell notes that there is NO effect of class size on achievement (p. 42). Ultimately this asks a few questions: a) what do we define as student achievement?, b) does no linear effect obscure a curvilinear effect (the inverted-U which we will get to in a bit) that could exist? and c) where is theory to guide any reasoning as to WHY these effects exist? To the first point, we never really know what ""academic achievement"" means: is it student participation (p. 58), grades/learning (not really discussed with any metrics), or teaching difficulty (not really achievement, but discussed a lot pp. 55-58)To the second point: If 15% of studies find evidence students do better in small classes, it doesn't mean they do worse, either. Taking a null effect as a premise and then devoting the rest of the chapter on the existence of an effect is a problem. A small class may stifle discussion/engagement, and a large class may dilute it, but does this actually affect student achievement as grades/learning, as the DV of this chapter focuses on? This isn't really addressed. Third, theory on WHY these effects should exist as they do is really lacking. I wasn't convinced regarding the idea that wealth leads people to lose ambition, since achievement motivation is highly dispositional, and that high wealth can make parenting also easier by allowing daycare and nannies (not discussed), or that class size and achievement really depends on the teacher and their ability/style (not modeled into graphs as moderator). So, I wasn't completely convinced that at a certain point mo' money=mo' problems, but the idea is interesting.Caroline Sacks:My favorite chapter. This idea is very interesting (though again anecdote), and shocking, actually. I won't spoil it for the reader, but the Fish Pond effect really makes me think about how many scientists aren't in the world that could be. Further, relative deprivation theory (which evolved into Festinger's Social Comparison theory)  IS  what I mean by having a sound theory to defend your arguments. pp. 82-87 has the most interesting statistics in the book, IMO. My only qualm is that there still may be benefits in going to Harvard, as the quality of education and learning may be better--but this is moot if people are leaving those fields anyway. Absolute vs. curving of grades should have been addressed, though. David BoiesMy least favorite chapter. Gladwell likes to set people up with one argument that is controversial, lead you on a path that reinforces and alludes to its veracity, and then drop it at the end. This chapter does that: NO, I WOULD NOT WISH DYSLEXIA ON MY CHILD, NOR WOULD ANY OF THE PARENTS OF SUCH CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKED. sidenote: the dichotomization of brain hemispheres by localized functionality discussed on p. 100 has been largely discredited. If a disadvantage is to be avoided, by definition, for us to wish dyslexia on someone, it should confer advantages in some way. Gladwell argues that difficulty in our lives leads us to step up to the challenge and find ways to be successful. He argues this with discussion of a few CEOs that have dyslexia. This chapter has a few fallacies, most notably on these points: a) selecting on the dependent variable, b) base rate neglect, c) confusing correlation with causation, d) non sequiturs, and e) no strong argument. If ""an extraordinarily high number of entrepreneurs are dyslexic"" (p. 106), this does not mean that dyslexia causes one to be an entrep., (point c), nor does it address the sheer number of people who likely have dyslexia but are neither successful nor entrepreneurs (points a and b). Did these entrepreneurs triumph in spite of their disability? The argument seems to be more about how they AVOIDED their disability by lying or finding ways around it (points d and e). The lawyers had to read, so those with dyslexia would ""get around reading"" (p. 108). Give people challenge in different ways, let them experience failure as a desirable difficulty, don't wish dyslexia upon them. Find other ways to learn from failure and cope with constructive hardship. Last note on this chapter are the similar problems with personality arguments: I don't know that dyslexia causes disagreeableness (point c), and ""not caring a whit for what others think of you"" (p. 118) isn't disagreeableness, it's neuroticism/emotional stability (point d and e).Emil ""Jay"" FreireichInteresting argument on near misses and remote misses, but this chapter runs a bit haphazardly in deviating from the central thesis of the book. These are the chapters that start to stir you emotionally, which is fine if that's what you want from the book. But it's a bit distracting if his purpose is to convince me. Note that in this chapter we hear (p. 134) of how many dyslexics aren't able to compensate for their disability, and wind up in prison. Where was this in the last chapter??? The issues of correlation≠causation, selecting on the DV and of base rate neglect also extends to this chapter in the relationship between losing a parent and being a creative type. Further, this book is predicated on the idea of the inverted-U: are there not a ton of people with no major difficulties or who didn't lose a parent who wound up being successful? WHY would losing a parent foster creativity? This hints at the issue being much more of an individual differences/dispositional cause than it being based on environmental circumstances. And again, all of this is anecdotal/speculative (Shuttlesworth & Blitz remote misses), though the idea is interesting. Lastly, the issue on cancer I should note does NOT follow the inverted-U, according to Gladwell's argument. It was simply that being very aggressive in drug therapy would be better for patients, suggesting a more linear relationship.Wyatt WalkerConfusing chapter. And I feel Gladwell misleads the reader for emotional effect. Specifically, the picture of the civil rights guy that the entire chapter notes he is just standing there saying ""Take me here I am"", when the last page (p. 192) completely switches the point suggesting not passivity but readiness to elbow the dog in the head. But I guess there is some value in this chapter to the point of underdogs having some advantages through their unconventional methods, rather than fighting like Goliaths, which is a fair point that enlightened my understanding of the CRM. Rosemary LawlorThis chapter posits that the things we think are big may not actually be so big. This is defended okay, but the takeaway about the principle of legitimacy is the best point, though again poorly executed with respect to the inverted-U idea, sticking to defending the thesis, and the choice of dependent variables. With the Brownsville policing, this is just a story. It's hard to follow how it relates to Davids and Goliaths, and where the level of policing relates to crimes/arrests. It's just a program based on social exchange and the norm of reciprocity. It didn't seem to mean legitimacy, just killing with kindness and care. Legitimacy would mean consequences. I'm surprised we didn't see more here about the war on drugs in other countries and the harsh penalties that are given. This could have supported the case a bit better about legitimacy. Wilma DerksenAgain, this tugs on my heart strings, but it's hard to see how this follows the rest of the book. Where is David, where is Goliath? The three strikes law can't follow an inv-U (and it isn't a theory, but a description of results [p. 238]) because it either exists or it doesn't, it doesn't exist in degrees--it's dichotomous. Also, this chapter confounds the graphs of equating a strong police presence (IV #1) with the severity of criminal punishments (IV #2) and their effects on crime (DV). This seems to be treated as the same thing on p. 243. And also, the point of criminal sentencing is also confused: do longer sentences ""work"" on young men but not for older men? This shouldn't matter. It's about serving the time for your crime, not deterring crime. Criminals should pay across the board whoever they are, so the issue is obscured in that graph. Again, Gladwell doesn't do research, but aggregates findings from across many anecdotes and some figures, and creates a story around this. The idea is there, but the execution is flawed. Clear IVs and DVs should exist with a theory that explains their Inverted-U relationship. The story about the power to forgive doesn't even reflect the book's story: if forgiveness saves her friendship/marriage/sanity, this does not mean that punishing a criminal who perpetrated a horrendous crime and deserves what is coming to them will make someone lose these things. The inverted-U is upside down.Andre TrocmeJust another story about how we wouldn't expect someone to do something because they are supposedly disadvantaged, but our understanding of what an advantage actually is is skewed. A concluding chapter that sums up his thesis and recaps everything would have helped, but the book sort of abruptly ends, as shall this review."
284,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27143847-laura,5,"I took A level sociology at college and absolutely loved every lesson so of course I knew I was going to enjoy reading this. A book about how perceived disadvantages aren't always as much a disadvantage as they seem.I loved how every chapter linked to a different person so that you could really connect what Malcolm Gladwell was saying to real life events. I found Chapter 5, about Emil J. Freireich, so interesting. And, the chapter based around the religious war in Ireland really moving.What captured me most about David and Goliath was how it got me thinking about how the topic affected me in my daily life. I have to use the hospital a lot for my chronic illnesses and it definitely made me notice a few things. For me, 99% of the time Doctors from foreign countries are the ones that are willing to go that little bit further, push that little big harder. Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell I think I know now that this is because they've had to fight that little bit harder to get to where they are. Whereas, most English Doctors have had if quite easy in comparison to those for who education is a great privilege. Overall, they way David and Goliath was written was really engaging and thought provoking. There was no droning on in the way that some non-fiction books tend to do. If you're at all interested in Sociology then I really recommend that you give it a read."
285,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"In David and Goliath Underdogs Misfits and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell quotes the English essayist Thomas De Quincey who said, ""It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at an early age"". That's pretty much the crux of this book: Traits or experiences that may look like weaknesses or disadvantages might actually become advantages to the right person. I emphasise that because it seems to be the point that Gladwell most glosses over: He makes the point, for example, that 30% of entrepreneurs tend to be dyslexic (like Richard Branson or Brian Grazer) but a quick  google search shows that 50% of the prison population is also dyslexic; despite the power-of-the-underdog thesis that Gladwell is trying to prove here, we can never forget that it is the temperament of the underdog himself that determines whether he will overcome or be overwhelmed by the odds stacked against him.Like always, Gladwell is an interesting storyteller, and right from the beginning, with the Biblical account of David and Goliath, I was drawn in -- I had never considered (or been informed) that in the famous titular confrontation, David with his speed and long-range sling was pretty much guaranteed to win against the giant (who was weighted down with brass armour and weapons and perhaps suffering from genetic disorders related to giganticism) so long as David refused to battle Goliath on his own terms; in hand-to-hand combat. Like Captain Kirk refusing to play by the rules of the  Kobayashi Maru scenario, Gladwell makes the case that innovators are often disagreeable in the sense that they don't care if their behaviour conforms to society's expectations. And I'm pointedly name-dropping Captain Kirk there to ask the question, ""If this theory has its counterpart in pop culture, is it really ground-breaking?"" Gladwell can show his inverted-U graph to demonstrate that above a certain income (currently $75k/year) extra income doesn't bring extra happiness and that too much money is simply a burden, but Notorious B.I.G. already told us that ""mo money is mo problems"". And while Nietzsche may have said it first, didn't Kelly Clarkson say it best when she sang ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""? Again, are these ground-breaking theories if they've made it to the Hit Parade?As much as I did enjoy each individual story, there is one section that I object to: Gladwell tells of the murder of Kimber Reynolds, an 18-year-old victim of a car-jacking gone awry. In response, her father Mike drafted the Three Strikes Law that was put into practise in California in an effort to keep repeat offenders off the streets. Gladwell allows the still grieving father to proudly state that the stats show that the law is responsible for a drop in the murder rate by 6/day in California; lives that Mike Reynolds feels personally responsible for saving. Gladwell then pulls out his inverted-U graph to disprove what Reynolds thinks he has achieved and even suggests that the Three Strikes Law has made crime worse. While I also think that the over-incarceration of Americans is a social ill, and don't think that petty crimes should count towards a Three Strikes Law, the man who murdered Kimber Reynolds was a repeat violent offender who would have been off the streets if the law had been put into place earlier; this read to me as an unfair statistical manipulation that served to attack a still grieving parent. This section ends when Gladwell demurs from Reynolds' offer to show the author the spot where his daughter was murdered -- it's like we're supposed to come to some conclusion from this scene about what kind of a person the father is (obsessed and a little ghoulish) and what kind of a person the author is (professional and not ghoulish), even though Gladwell had been warned (and warns us) that the offer would be coming. I felt icky after reading this part.But again, I did enjoy reading this book because each of the stories is interesting and well told -- it is only on reflection that the unifying theme seems to fall apart or lose significance. I also have to note this review that includes a refutation of a theory from one of Gladwell's earlier books, Outliers The Story of Success. In that book, Gladwell describes the ""iron law of Canadian hockey"": Because the minor leagues are sorted by the birth dates of the players, the NHL is mostly made up of athletes who were born in the first few months of the calendar year. This was fascinating to me when I first read it because I have a young nephew who is an incredible hockey player, but he was born at the end of November, and even his parents agree that it's unlikely that he will be streamed into the elite leagues once he reaches adolescence and his physical size begins to really lag behind peers who can be nearly a year older. Included in that review, however, is a research paper that shows that late babies like my nephew -- those who are underdogs and have to work that much harder to compete against their peers -- actually make up the ranks of the elite NHL players. This information would have added to the points that Gladwell was trying to make in this book and I would have respected the author more if he had included it as an addendum to the ""iron law of Canadian hockey""."
286,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,1,"I am sorry to give this book just one star, because Malcolm Gladwell seems like a nice person, he's a great story-teller, an independent thinker and, of course, I respect him personally and his work.But the one-star rating corresponds to 'I did not like it', and I didn't.I didn't because the stories in this book are so heart-rending. Maybe it's just the current challenging situation, but I cried through most of them, there's so much suffering and cruelty involved.As for the insights themselves, they surely are interesting and sometimes surprising, BUT one should keep in mind there might be other points of view. For instance, I've googled the J-RIP programme which is mentioned in the book as highly successful and it seems it has been deemed much less successful since the time the book came out. Not that it necessarily undermines Gladwell's conclusions or even the programme itself, - but it's a reminder these insights are not necessarily the ultimate truth.I guess the main conclusion - the power of the underdog - is supposed to be inspiring, but the book itself, because of all those horrible stories, was - for me - rather depressing. "
287,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"Some chapters of this book were just outstanding; others didn’t quite fly with me. But overall, very good. The chapter on leukemia, in particular, took some effort for me to get through without tears. My leukemia-survivor son listened to that chapter of the audio book with me, and after saying, ""Wow,"" we both just sat in silence for a minute afterward, letting the import of those events sink in. The book was worth reading for that chapter alone. Throughout the book, Gladwell offers a number of excellent observations and many engaging stories about the surprising advantages born out of disadvantage. "
288,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39050916-malcolm-everett,4,"“There are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish.”I love books that are wide and varied in scope and David and Goliath certainly falls into that category. Each chapter explores the very human, very personal stories of individuals from different times, places, and backgrounds. You’ll find anecdotes about ancient wars, high school basketball, classroom size, renowned French impressionists, childhood leukemia, dyslexia, Martin Luther King Jr., and religious conflicts in Northern Ireland. It really is an incredible amalgam of histories that opens your eyes to how truly vast the human experience can be. There is no question that Gladwell is a gifted storyteller in writing style and in voice (I highly recommend the audiobook version).Although the stories are engrossing and insightful, they are loosely connected and the associations between them grow fainter and fainter as you move away from the starting point: the story of David and Goliath, the underdog defeating the giant. The message becomes about power and authority and crime and law and a slew of other topics that make you wonder how in the hell you ended up there. In addition, there is a point on that inverted curve where a book becomes too sweeping, too focused on the revelatory—to the extent that you find yourself questioning every argument. A familiar phrase, beaten into me by years of psychology courses, looped through my head as I digested Gladwell’s claims: Correlation does not imply causation. A few examples I had trouble with: Gladwell claims that risk-takers, the ones who dare to be disagreeable and defy the status quo, can accomplish great things in this world. But he fails to recognize the times when such risk-tasking doesn’t pan out, when being disagreeable causes more problems than it solves. He also claims that bombings and near-misses can increase courage—but what is the definition of courage here? Are you really courageous to continue living in the line of fire, or are you smug with inflated delusions about your own luck and Godly protection? Every time I win a sweepstakes or narrowly avoid a car accident, I do tend to think to myself, “Wow, I’m such a lucky person, luckier than most people for sure. I am invincible.” But that’s what EVERYONE thinks. It is egocentrism, not courage. Even so, this is not a book that can be read passively; you are pushed to question your assumptions and then to question your questioning about your assumptions. It is the kind of reading that inspires you to do more outside research and form your own opinions.Ultimately, David and Goliath is about individuals overcoming personal disadvantages, hardship, and oppression. If there is any coherent message to be taken from this book, it is that the difficulties in our lives can be catalysts for greatness. Everyone has the capacity to achieve success not despite of life’s obstacles, but because of them. Strategy can triumph over strength. Would the man who founded an effective treatment for leukemia have done so if he hadn’t had a rough childhood? Would J.K. Rowling have written Harry Potter if she hadn’t first been dirt poor? Would you have succeeded if you hadn’t first failed?We are all underdogs in some respect, at some point in our lives. Your shortcomings do not signify the end of your potential—in fact, they may very well be the beginning. "
289,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,2,"Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages; how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books, I quickly tired of the long anecdotes, getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.Gladwell explains how the inverted-U curve applies to many areas. The inverted-U curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point; after that point, additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad), wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad), and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).Another main point is that of “near misses.” Gladwell describes how during the London blitz, there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person, but didn’t kill them). Remote misses instilled fear, but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage, because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way, challenges in people’s lives can be “near misses,” increasing their fortitude.Notes• Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.• Class size has no effect on student performance in the US, according to multiple studies.""Fish"" in ""ponds""• Although there are advantages to the “big pond” even if you’re a “small fish,” there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes one’s chances of success.• We compare ourselves to people around us, not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.• A student at a less-prestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university, because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). It’s easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.• The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness, because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.• Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve, increasing the chances that they’ll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.• Capitalization learning: getting good at something that you’re naturally given. Compensation learning: being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example: a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard, requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise, because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.• Power/authority must be seen as legitimate, or it has the opposite effect."
290,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5366206-josh,2,"Why does this book exist? It’s a question I like to ask myself whenever I’m reading, but particularly when I’m reading nonfiction. It isn’t that nonfiction should be judged by different criteria, but fiction can always be justified on the grounds that it is for entertainment, if nothing else.So why does David and Goliath exist? Presumably it is for the sake of informing. Gladwell is a smart guy that does research and presents it to the world in nice, easily digestible, 300 page bites. But why this book? The Tipping Point, Outliers, and Blink all have a clear thesis and a clear purpose (small events can be the catalyst for change, 10,000 hours is enough practice for anyone to become a master, first impressions are incredibly powerful, but often broken). So what does David bring to the table? I’ve just finished it and I’m still not sure. It certainly shows its reader a number of examples that demonstrate how an underdog can achieve in the face of what look to be insurmountable odds...but does there need to be a book for that? For people familiar with sports, or any kind of competition, the lesson is already something we’ve had hammered into us. Never underestimate the opponent. Anybody can win at any time. Just ask Michigan fans if they remember Appalachian State, if you don’t believe me.Another strike against D and G is the lack of interesting anecdotes to make the point. In previous books, Gladwell has told some pretty amazing tales to help prove his points. Here, we get the eponymous take itself (fantastic, but cmon, does it need repeating?) We also get a story about a successful 12 year old girls basketball team, the civil rights movement, and some people who overcame dyslexia. Tales of the IRA, and of the Huguenots in France were somewhat interesting, but many of the cases just felt flat or else belabored before Gladwell even touched them. Gladwell‘s latest effort is far from the worst book of nonfiction one might find, but comparing it against his other works, it falls short. If you haven’t read Gladwell before, I wouldn’t start here. If you’re an ardent supporter, and absolutely must read this book, I’d recommend you find a used copy. As for me, I just wish I knew why it exists at all."
291,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033055-a-r,3,"I have mixed feeling about this one. As he usually does, Gladwell finds some fascinating life case studies to look at. As for proving his thesis though, it just doesn't feel as successful as some of his other work.While the idea that advantages and disadvantages are not always what they appear to be is an intriguing one, I found myself asking over and over is Gladwell proving that thesis or just providing some exceptionable examples of where that is not always the case.I think the chapter on dyslexia is a good example. Yes, there are some very successful people who happen to have dyslexia and maybe that struggle with dyslexia did help make them successful. But all the people who struggle with dyslexia and other learning disabilities who don't find ways to adapt--what about them regarding this premise? Gladwell just glosses over that these specific examples are quite exceptional. I think that's fine if you central theme is that we can't assume that all people with different kinds of struggles receive no benefit from those struggles, but Gladwell was going for something much bigger than that.I guess I should note here that I'm a survivor of child abuse (from both parents) and my struggles with my childhood have in many ways helped me become a successful adult. However, those struggles have also made my life miserable many times as well. I think this distinction is likely common among ""survivors"" of various trauma and I did not really see this discussed with much depth in the book. If you're going to argue these people are better off for their struggles, I think you also have to examine the ways that they are not better off before you determine that maybe things weren't so bad after all. Are there hidden advantages? Possibly, but I think it's incorrect to assume because an exceptional group can use those advantages to further themselves or their goals that the experience for the overall group."

The choices on offer were uninspiring to say the least and it was either this book or Alex Ferguson on life. So having plonked for this book with a certain skepticism that it would combine the usual gladwellian mix of anecdotes stretched around and most maddeningly avenues skipped in favor of the easy crowd pleasing dunks, I had every expectation confirmed in the first 5 pages. An example as follows, many successful people are dyslexics, which personally gives me faith but if you admit that most fail why not explain why some succeed. Is there really any surprise that having a weakness in one area will lead to compensatory strengths and if even if these strengths are pretty lame regardless would you not expect a few to just luck out.Any real enquiry is frustratingly skipped around perhaps because that would involve an effort beyond look at some fun stories but more likely because if your going up against Alex bloody fergueson my annoying smug homespun wisdom you need to be remotely entertaining.

294,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,4,"Though Gladwell's interpretation of the David and Goliath story leaves a bit to be desired (he reads too much into certain narrative details and fails utterly to place the story in the bigger story of David—and the even bigger story of Jesus), the principle he uncovers in the book seems valid: underdogs have more strength, and ""overdogs"" have more weaknesses, than we might initially expect.Gladwell is a master prose writer, meriting the neologism ""Gladwellian."" He finds the most interesting stories, offers an impressive number of insights per page, and generally keeps the emotional energy going from beginning to end. This is my fourth Gladwell book, and in only one of them did I start wishing for the end to come sooner.The stories about dyslexia really stuck with me, both by humbling me (reading and spelling have always been second nature to me) and giving me empathy for gifted friends (especially one, and she knows who she is!) who have succeeded both in spite and because of their learning disabilities.The stories about the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland also made an impact, serving this point: ""The excessive use of force creates legitimacy problems, and force without legitimacy leads to defiance, not submission."" Authority needs to be perceived as fair or it will lose legitimacy.A few more lessons (if Gladwell is to be believed–and even if he isn't, I'm unlikely to run into the writer who refutes him, so he wins):• Small class sizes aren't necessarily beneficial; teachers prefer a large enough group to get emotional energy through conflict and small enough not to be overwhelmed.• An Indian immigrant who knew nothing about basketball realized that his unskilled shooters could never beat more experienced teams unless they contested every inch of court space.• A doctor who lacked empathy was able to push past difficulties in treating childhood leukemia.• A valedictorian discovered it's better to be a big fish in a small pond (by going to a state university) than a small fish in a big one (by going to highly competitive Brown). This was particularly meaningful for me. It resonated deeply.• The German bombing of London was counterproductive because those it failed to kill developed a sense of invincibility.• The Civil Rights movement in 1960s Birmingham stumbled on a way to get the apparently all-powerful Bull Connor to overplay his hand.• Christian forgiveness may have done more to retard crime than the ""revenge"" taken by California's failed three-strikes law.• The persecution that created the French Huguenot community made them impervious to the threats of the Nazis and the Vichy government, and they became efficient hiders of Jewish refugees.When you get to the end of a Gladwell book, you do feel as if you've been taken for a ride, that you've had to take his word on a lot of interpretations of stories and studies. But in this book I sensed an earnestness and a personality, someone who believes in the value of what he writes, who believes he's found truth. Perhaps this is the voice of the Gladwell who regained his Christian faith after witnessing real forgiveness in Manitoba while researching for this book."

While ""David and Goliath"" is not a perfect book, it is characterized by Gladwell's trademark style -- erudite but engaging, clarifying but not reductive, and integrated like a Mozart fugue. The volume is strongest when Gladwell is engaged in character studies; his material on U-curves (school size, crime, etc.) is highly informative.I do wish I might engage with the author on a couple of subjects raised. Specifically, it may well be true that being a ""Big Fish in a Small Pond"" is often better than being a ""Small Fish in a Big Pond,"" but being a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" is usually better than both. That's intuitive, but Gladwell's own data from the book bears that out. For instance, he shows that top graduates of mid-tier economics graduate programs publish at a higher level than mid-tier graduates of top economics programs--but the key point that he glosses over is that top students at top programs publish at a higher level and rate than either. What Gladwell ignores is that his analysis occurs only in hindsight. So, in the example of a Brown University student called ""Caroline Sacks"" who struggles at her Ivy League school (Small Fish in a Big Pond) and regrets not going to the University of Maryland (where she would have been a Big Fish in a Small Pond), she only know this through the rear view mirror of negative experience. A priori, she could in theory have been a ""Big Fish in a Big Pond"" -- she was gifted at sciences in high school, so she might have proven a star science student at Brown and gone on to win a Nobel Prize. How could she have predicted in advance that she would not be? On average, following Gladwell's own logic and data, the top students at Brown have more opportunities than the top students at Maryland, but you can often only figure out if you promise to be one of these stars by gambling and going to Brown.... The key, subjective question is whether it's a gamble worth taking. If your dream is to be a dentist in the suburbs, the answer is probably not. But if your dream is to transform western civilization, that's a very different matter....A second quibble I'd like to raise with Gladwell is that he doesn't offer a good framework for figuring out which ""Davids"" succeed in defeating ""Goliaths"" and which ones don't. Because underdogs may win more than expected, but most still lose. Alas, he only briefly touches on what is to me the underlying $64,000 question. With those caveats in mind, this is a compelling and insightful volume and a fast-paced pleasurable read. Most readers will be able to plow through it in one or two sittings and will benefit from the experience. Gladwell may have a niche and a shtick, but he has mastered his techniques like nobody else in the business."

I feel like this book has helped me to understand why my life has played out the way it has and therefore the promise of my future, if I can make something out of my disadvantages. One part was so inspiring, I cried. I don't mean weepy, feminine, silent tears. I mean great ugly sobs that made me fall to my knees in the middle of sorting laundry. I can't tell you why--at any rate, I won't. But when the right book comes into a person's life at the right time, big things happen. The ideas set forth here are a mix of anecdotal and and empirical proofs. Reading this was like reading a mashup of Freakonomics and Brene Brown, both of whom I love. I'm surprised by how much scriptural accounts play a part in this, and I think I'll need to google Malcolm Gladwell to see exactly what his background is (right now, I know him only as the 10,000 hours guy). Whatever his background, I'm on board with what he's saying here. A couple of quotes I never want to forget:""Yet, they also knew firsthand what the price of that success was, and they could not bring themselves to wish that same experience on their own children. But the question of what any of us would wish on our children is the wrong question, isn’t it? The right question is whether we as a society NEED people who’ve emerged from some kind of trauma, and the answer is that we plainly do. This is not a pleasant fact to contemplate. For every remote miss who becomes stronger, there are countless near-misses who are crushed by what they have been through. There are times and places, however, when all of us depend on people who have been hardened by their experiences. Freireich had the courage to think the unthinkable. He experimented on children. He took them through pain no human being should ever have to go through. And he did it in no small part because he understood from his own childhood experience that it is possible to emerge from even the darkest hell healed and restored. Leukemia was a direct hit. He turned it into a remote miss.” “It was not the privileged and fortunate who took I the Jews in France. It was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what real evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death, and destruction, but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair, but one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. You see the giant and the shepherd in the valley of Ela, and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor, but so much of what is beautiful and valuable in this world comes from the Shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.”"

He tried to give a different notion of the advantage of disadvantages.Firstly, he tried to tell us that Goliath was at disadvantage because of his enormous size which isn't the case. Big sized entities tend to win. And, David had the intellect and faith to beat Goliath by taking advantage of his weakness; although David, as being Prophet, was given that knowledge for greater good.Then he presented the idea of those who lost a parent have the advantage of bringing rage into their work which got them succeed (not a case for everyone).Previous books of Malcolm were superb but he built the notions he left in those books and used vague and out of context examples to bring the advantage of the disadvantages.He spent too much time on Martin Luther King and nothing came up after numerous pages of Martin being an underdog.What I liked in the book was the idea of, it is good to be a big fish in a small pond for better results and that, being an underdog is not a disadvantage all the time.He also gave parenting advice which were misfits and out of context.
Overall, this book was a disappointment and I found it very hard finishing it.

298,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368218-deb,1,"Argh!!!! Here's my rant. He cites the publishing rates of economists to explain why STEM grads from elite vs non elite universities are equivalent. But economists? Are they really STEM? If they are, do they really represent all engineers? Science grads? Mathematicians? Wha???? The dyslexia part made me want to scream at my audiobook. You can't site a few superstar bios to justify the suffering and mistreatment of dyslexic children, waving off studies that show dyslexics suffer so much they are IMPRISONED at an abnormally high rate. (Dying of frustration.) You don't need to read this book because it is either just anecdotes or common sense. And David wasn't the underdog. He had the better weapon. Against a diseased tall guy. Another of Malcolm's discussions is on elite colleges. Yes, you will feel dumber at Harvard and smarter at a less elite college. That is common sense I learned at Great Wolf Lodge, where I am a supermodel. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances on feeling a bit pudgy and vacation in Hawaii. Aloha."
299,0316204366,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,4," Updated November 2019 I decided to re-read this book as a reminder to myself that Bigger is not always better and to get an understanding of how I can better battle some of the giants in my life. A lot of the items covered in this book remains relevant today. A must read! 2014  Malcolm Gladwell can do no wrong in my eyes. He's got the gift of storytelling and I love that he uses it to tackle topics that would otherwise be boring he did it in his previous books and ""David and Goliath"" is no different. I love the premise of the book, you really do get a different look at how a disadvantage can be an advantage. I liked that Gladwell opened the book with the story of David and Goliath, the most referenced underdogs story. The fact that he gave an in-depth look into the battle between the two really was one of the high points of the book. I can gush for hours at how interesting Gladwell makes the most boring of topic but you have to read it for yourself. I was always a fan of the underdogs and misfits, thanks Gladwell, now I am a bigger fan!"
