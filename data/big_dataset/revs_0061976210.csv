0,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164109-pete,4,"An acquaintance recently remarked that there has not been any good criticism of Melville in the last half-century. The comment got me thinking about the best critical texts on ""Moby-Dick."" They rarely deal with the novel itself, and generally read as semi-autonomous poetic works with enough artistic merit to deserve critical attention themselves. The critical history of ""Moby-Dick"" is incomparable to the critical history of any other literary text; limited is the number of academic jerk-off sessions, great is the number of poems and ""creative non-fiction"" that don't so much address the mysteries of the great novel as they do exist in its orbit. ""The Whale: In Search of the Giants,"" nearly as long as Melville's best known work, is such a text. It offers little in the way of physiological or behavioral details of the great swimming mammal that are not found in MB(I had borrowed the book in hopes of finding something like a Frans de Waal primatology text but for whales and was, surprisingly, not disappointed to find that the research necessary for such a treatise doesn't exist: how could it, when these animals traverse the entirety of the planet in relatively brief intervals, making extended research on their social customs impossible?). ""The Whale"" is a very good book for anyone interested in vastness, Melville and the psychic impact of human consumption. Human consumption, I suppose, is the real theme of the book: we consume space, knowledge and resources at an unimaginable pace. The whale is that facet of humanity's natural counterpart: it is unimaginably large, inhabits an impossibly vast swath of the planet, and has been brought to its knees only by the harpoon, mechanical sonar, and mercury poisoning. The impact of man on the sperm whale's population is sad but also impressive, in a guiltily chest-thumping sort of way; after all, this is an animal whose natural enemy is the giant squid, which is said to grow up to 200 feet long, has two hearts, a super-mean beak, and has the general appearance of a space creature intended to devour whole planets. And maybe that's what ""Moby-Dick"" is all about, too. That, or homosexuality. Or intertextual connections to every Western text, ever. Or good and evil. Or the danger in viewing the world in absolute terms. Or whatever. "
1,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria,4,"Like most people, I have loved whales since I was a kid (though I have always been more fascinated by sharks...). This book's title, however, was a bit misleading... there were a lot of fascinating facts about whales, but it was honestly more about whaling than the whales themselves. Which made it a pretty depressing (albeit very interesting) read, all in all. And throughout, the book constantly references Moby-Dick: or, The Whale, and the life of Herman Melville. So, if you are very familiar with that piece of classic literature, I think you will enjoy this more than someone who only has limited knowledge of the book.My only real complaint was that I would have liked even more information about the whales themselves, their lives and their habits, and a little less about the cruelty and utter destruction brought upon them by mankind. Although, this book managed to give a balanced look into whaling, and did not come off as the Sea Shepard's, or another eco-terrorist group's, manual. There certainly were a lot of facts that any eco-group could use, however. In handling this sensitive topic of history, this author certainly did a wonderfully detailed job. Well-written (despite a few rather abrupt transitions), and well-researched, the photos and drawings added a lot to this good, but on the whole, rather depressing look into the history of humanity's relationship with the whale."
2,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/857936-jennifer,1,"I don't know if I can finish this book. In the early pages the author wrote ""I was ready to believe in whales"" and I shut the book in anger. Now whenever I'm about to pick it up I remember, ""I was ready to believe in whales"" and start muttering crankily to myself something like the following ""the fuck? ready to believe in whales? they exist. you don't believe in fucking whales. ready to fucking believe in whales? fuck this. tv time"". so....i don't know if i can get past that. So I finished it. I stand by everything I said above. "
3,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1158209-kevin,2,"First, let me say that this book should probably mention Moby Dick in the title, as nearly half of the book is about Melville's white whale. Now, I don't have any problem with reading about Moby Dick, but the focus on that book made this one a little uneven. At times I felt like I was reading a comp lit dissertation. At other times it is sort of a natural history and at others it is a bit of a travelogue. Occasionally there is a really interesting fact or tidbit, or a nice bit of writing that captures the mystery and awesomeness of the whale, but these moments are outnumbered by the choppy, boring, and lame parts of the book. "
4,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany,2,"Are you a wildlife enthusiast looking for a really good overview of the current state of marine mammal science especially cetology? Me, too! Let me know if you find a book like that! Because it's not this one. I'm really glad I""read this book by listening to it rather than by reading it as a dead-tree book. Listening to it aloud allowed me to argue with the author but still basically enjoy the book. If I'd been reading it with my eyes, I probably would either not have finished it, or it would have taken me far longer.For one thing, Hoare kept making sweeping statements that either can't be true or that he couldn't possibly prove or know. (Such as ""sperm whales have the most sophisticated social system of any non-human mammal on the planet."" Or ""sperm whales have the slowest reproductive rate of any mammal."") That type of thing, especially in a book that claims to be science writing, just aggravates me. Overall, though this book isn't actually science writing. There is some science writing in it, but it's also a detailed look into the writing, details, meaning, and symbolism of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale and the circumstances of Herman Melville's life. And, like Moby Dick itself, there was a surprising amount of discussion of homoeroticism and of penises. (Speaking of odd emphasis: If you've been asked to narrate a book on whales and wildlife, possibly you should consult with a biologist about any words you're unfamiliar with. For instance, it's CEPH-alopod not ce-PHAL-opod. Though that did fit in with the phallic emphasis of the rest of the book.) I'm glad I read it, and there was some interesting information about whaling, about sailing, and about the history of humanity's interaction with whales. And even some novel information about whales! There's a whole bunch of good information once we move past Moby Dick, and some great stuff about rescues. Stormy's even in it! If the whole book had been like that, I would have loved it. But it's not the book I was hoping for. "
5,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1898325-grace,5,"I didn't realise I was so interested in whales! Well, perhaps I'm not but the brilliance of this book is such that it doesn't matter. It's a very engaging read and full of lovely illustrations. In fact, you get the impression the publishers were surprisingly supportive of what sounds like a slightly leftfield book (400 pages of why I'm interested in whales, the history of commercial whaling and Moby Dick) - they haven't crammed the text in and there are plenty of pictures (black and white). However, I take heart (coming from the 'cut it' school) from the fact that he doesn't seem to have been able to get permission to include the full 'Herman Melville' by W. H. Auden though he clearly wanted to, quoting snippets here and there (or perhaps he did and I just didn't notice, or perhaps it is hideously long?) - anyway, I might look it up. And I want to give Moby Dick itself another go now, having given up at one of the many digressions about whale byproducts first time around. Def worth a read unless you are really determined to have some plot and action."
6,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,2,"First let me say, this was a book challenge read. This wouldn't have been on my radar otherwise. So with that little disclaimer, this was just alright. It was loaded with research, facts and little lesser-known tidbits, and....lots of references to Moby Dick, Ishmael, and Herman Melville (btw, I didn't like that book). This book had its interesting moments, but I always went back to wanting this to be over. I think it is sad though, how these magnificent beings were unnecessarily hunted and butchered by mankind. This book visited that message over and over again. It was painful. I'm sorry I didn't enjoy this more."
7,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"I was expecting The Whale to be just that, a book about whales. And it is, but it is so much more. The Whale is a meditation on whales, on Moby Dick, on loss, on whaling, on history, even on life. Philip Hoare writes from a position of deep knowledge as well as deep love, and he writes about his subjects---whales, Herman Melville, whalers, whaling ships---as a starting point for his thoughts about vast themes---history, loss, loneliness, human connections---eloquently, almost following the model of his much-admired author, Melville himself. The Whale is a perfect book to read alongside Moby Dick. I recommend watching Philip Hoare's documentary, The Hunt for Moby Dick, too."

I learned quite a bit about whales of several different species. I understand that those expecting simply a natural history of the mother of all fantastic beasts could be disappointed or annoyed when they see how much of the book is devoted to the whales' mostly grim experiences with the human species, as well as humans' attempts to capture the whale in art and literature. However, like it or not, what we have done to the whale has shaped and continues to shape its behavior, habitat, and mere survival. Kudos to the author for acknowledging that just because some nations have scuttled their whaling fleets doesn't mean we have entered into a new, harmonious way of living with these otherworldly beings--he sees past the ""research"" and ""cultural"" whaling excuses to see them for exactly what they are, unsustainable and unnecessary, not to mention the new-world threats to whales posed by factory fishing practices, collisions with ships, and military sonar."
10,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,4,"This book is the eloquently written biography of the whale, told from the perspective of an individual who is on a journey of discovery to satisfy his passionate desire for knowledge of these magnificent creatures. It is a richly woven tapestry which is part historical, party biographical and autobiographical and part zoology. The prose used is magnificently written and there is a real sense of connection, not only with the creatures which form the main subject of the book, but also with the author themselves.There was considerable time spent within the text on Herman Melville's life, which while it was certainly fascinating, could probably have been omitted or replaced with more information on the whales themselves, or their relationship with humans.Several highlights in the book included the information on what the body of a whale provides to humans, even in todays enlightened times. Also, the final segment of the book involves the author finally having the opportunity to dive with these majestic creatures, and the style in which the writers feelings and emotions throughout this experience were conveyed through the written word was truly a joy.A great book but not quite in my 'top books' category, due to the lack of content on whales themselves and the greater degree of focus on the authors journey to discover more on this subject."
11,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34200-magda,4,"They are Linnæan-classified aliens following invisible magnetic fields, seeing through sound and hearing through their bodies, moving through a world we know nothing about. They are animals before the Fall, innocent of sin.As with everything in whaling, periods of frenetic energy alternated with soporific inaction or numbing drudgery. Time itself was different at sea. Far from land, the levelling ocean flattened out the days to be recreated in nautical dispensations, reordered from noon to noon.Melville gave the finished copy to Hawthorne that afternoon. In those few seconds, as the book passed from hand to hand, between leaving go and taking hold, all the effort, all the energy of his life was distilled, the summary of his existence to date.Rising and falling with the changing seasons of ice, they are barometers of an invisible world, spectrally floating within their bounded sea, locked into its cycle.And somewhere in the fathomless, gathering darkness, sperm whales swim, eternally aware, their loves one waking dream, moving through valleys that run thirty thousand miles along the ocean floor, through lakes that lie stilly in the abyss, separated by temperature like pools of mercy, past jellyfish pulsating as ghostly Victorian brides in ectoplasmic crinolines."
12,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/412055-kerfe,5,"""It was shockingly strange.""I wish I had read this before reading ""Moby Dick"" instead of after. Hoare uses Melville's book as a touchpoint for his musings on whales and whaling, and his insights give a valuable counterpoint to the novel. I definitely would have absorbed more from from both Melville's factual and imaginative digressions, and I think it would also have enhanced for me the book's broader vision.The sheer destructiveness, wastefulness, and voracious appetite of man is laid out in numbing numbers. The complete disregard for other species and lack of awareness of the tiny space we should occupy in the fragile balance of the planet are reflected in the story of our treatment of this ancient species. But then, consider how we treat one another. The history of whaling intersects the history of slavery and continuous warfare. Mystery, awe, repect--lost to the God of Mammon.Circling around his subject, Hoare manages to create those lost feelings even as he chronicles both the facts and the still-unknowns. An absorbing read, encompassing history, literature, science, ecology, technology, relationships, geography, the personal and the spiritual; artistic vision illuminating the political and social interactions between human and cetacean."
13,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,5,"A captivating narrative on Moby Dick, Herman Melville and whales. One gets the impression that the author is smitten with Melville’s tale of the white whale – its’ grandeur and elusiveness. Indeed it is a story unlike any other. The author ventures to Melville territory in Cape Code and gives fitting descriptions of whaling life there in the 19th century.He also explores the treatment of whales since the end of World War II – when millions more have been slaughtered by the increased efficiency of modern hunting weapons. The natural history and the changing scientific view of the whale are examined over the last few centuries – leading to many zoological observations.It is an entertaining book to read and has wonderful illustrations. If one is obsessed by Melville’s Moby Dick, as I am, there is much of interest!One of my favourite quotes on page 343 from Friedrich Nietzsche “Beyond Good and Evil”: “He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.”"
14,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007954-david-corleto-bales,5,"Outstanding book by Philip Hoare which walks in the footsteps of Herman Melville while writing Moby Dick, and a general history of whaling, with fascinating sidetrips. People have been whaling for a very long time, but the commercial-type whaling only dates from around the eighteenth century. Hoare goes all around the world tracing the development of whaling, the birth of the International Whaling Commission, (and the birth of the environmental movement) types of whaling and the creation of the post-World War II ""factory ships"" which drove most species of whales to extinction within 20 years. This is a highly-recommended, almost magical book for people interested in natural history, whales, obscure parts of the world, (the islands of the South Pacific or the Azores, for example) and whaling lore."
15,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32137651-kristina-doucet,4,"A well written and researched book, with a lot of great information - but just another reminder of how horrible humans are, and how much we've destroyed this world with little regret. "
16,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59725-virginia,5,"Let me tell you, I was SO glad that I had previously read Moby-Dick or, The Whale and was relatively familiar with it before reading this book. This is really the author’s paean to Herman Melville, who he seems to have a bit of a crush on. I personally think Herman Melville was a little weird, so I was not totally thrilled with the deviation from whales to whalers, BUT the author’s unbridled enthusiasm for the topic carried the book. I did have to fight the urge to gently remind the author that Ishmael is a fictional character, and not a historical figure. While it is extremely likely that he was based on a real person, or amalgam of persons, it is not as though Moby Dick is the personal journal of an actual individual. However, quotes from Ishmael are included interspersed with information from actual real people – scholars & historians. This made me twitch.I was also glad that I had a good frame of reference to work with – I’ve been on the Charles W. Morgan, to Nantucket & New Bedford, etc. (I went to a couple of Moby Dick marathons, which were actually pretty awesome. They live tweet them now: @mbydickmarathon) If not, I think it would have been difficult to visualize or connect with a LOT of this book. It helped to have read In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex previously as well. I think the author is completely crazy, based on reading this, but he was SO ENTHUSIASTIC about everything having to do with whales and (especially) Herman Melville that it was endearing. He was so honest in his enthusiasm and interest that it was hard not to like this book.Although – two things.1. I cannot believe he did not mention the Star Trek movie with the whales, when discussing whales in popular culture!! I find it hard to believe that this dude has NOT seen this movie.2. I do not think this review would be complete without this video:Mariachis Serenading a Beluga"
17,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65248452-james-devereaux,2,"A favorite childhood novel, Watership Down, often features pictures of rabbits on the front cover. Though I was confused by the title when younger, unfamiliar with English geographical terms, I knew this book contained rabbits. However, if this book had featured a picture of a rabbit, a crocodile, and a mountain lion, I would expect that the crocodile and mountain lion would make significant appearances within the book. Though it is said, ""do not judge a book by the cover,"" the cover nonetheless sets expectations together with the title. This book appeared to promise a variety of whales- orca, sperm, bowhead, and narwhal all grace the cover. The title promises ""The Whale"" the general term, a term that encompasses many varieties. In reality the book featured mostly the sperm whale through the lens of Moby Dick, and dwells heavily on the practice of whaling. By the time other whales are featured more than in passing the book is near the end. Lacking the more naturalist discussion hinted at, this work delves deeply into the lives of early whalers and those, who like Melville, observed the giants of the sea. It discusses our history with the whale adequately, but the strong focus on this period and single author detracts from the broader topic.Though the writing is well done, admittedly at times over the top, this book is a bit of a disappointment if only for it's failure to deliver on the outward promise of the cover and title. I suspect an hour long nature documentary would have provided more information on ""The Whale"" than this book. Instead we dwelt mostly with Melville and his literary white whale, one that appears to have obsessed more than one author."
18,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59472542-giulia-moonrise-bookdom,5,"*4.5I don't read much non-fiction, but I was interested in the main subject of this book (whales) and it proved to be a great surprise! This book is beautifully interesting, instructive and thrilling at the same time.The author deals with the topic in an original way, in fact in every chapter we find different sides of the topic interwoven together in a single narration: information about the whales as animals (naturalistic aspect), an analysis of how men have related to whales during history (especially with respect to whale hunting), the whale as a symbolic/fantastic animal in literature and lastly, the personal journey of the author, the story of his special fondness for whales. Sometimes this last aspect makes the writing too wordy and sentimental, but I personally could overcome this drawback.I discovered a lot of new things both about whales and humans while reading this book, and there wasn't a single boring page!"
19,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,4,"This book took me what felt like ages to read (because it made me so sad). I've loved all kinds of whales since I was a little girl, and have always been drawn to stories about them. I took a course in college that was entirely focused on Melville and the whale. So while I already knew a lot of the information and back-story provided in the introductory chapters on whaling, and Melville, and Moby-Dick, I was committed to following this book to its watery end. And so I kept coming back to it, eager to finish, but also entirely disheartened by the overall truth inherent in it: Whales are magic and we are monsters.Humans across all continents have actively, willingly destroyed (nearly to the brink of ultimate, interspecies extinction) one of the most fascinating, evolved, and majestic creatures on this planet. We as a species are still actively, willingly hunting, killing, and decimating their already fragile populations—populations still valiantly trying to replenish themselves after humans killed hundreds of thousands of whales just in the last 50 years. As much as I'd love to believe whaling is long-discarded barbaric behavior of the very distant past, that just isn't true. In the 1950s ships were documented as taking 30,000 whales in one season, with sometimes up to twenty-four whales killed a day. Russian and Japanese whaling vessels killed a quarter of a million sperm whales from 1964-1974. In 1965 alone 72,471 sperm whales were killed. The Azores didn't outlaw whaling until 1986. Norway, Iceland, and Japan area all STILL openly hunting and killing whales. The ocean being far too big a place to consistently police and whales being far too helpless against today's technology and harpooning tools, there are likely countries and organizations secretly engaged in illegal whaling operations in every ocean across the globe. My mind can hardly wrap itself around how the oceans might look had we not sought to annihilate the whale (and myriad other species of marine mammal, cephalopod, fish, and water fowl alongside it). One study (published in 2015) estimates humans are directly responsible for over three million whale deaths throughout the past century. THREE. MILLION. WHALES. Killed for their oil, their blubber, their spermaceti, their ambergis, their meat, for sport, and ultimately and most pervasively—for greed. Whales were big business, and in places like Japan and Norway they still are big business. I have little doubt that if whales were a naturally replenishing resource, an endless source of life and energy, humans would still be whaling in every country. Most whales stopped being hunted not because it was morally bankrupt behavior, but because there stopped being enough of them to make it lucrative. Whales became harder to find, and thus more expensive to hunt. I could talk about whales and what our collective decimation of their populations means to humans as a supposed ""evolved"" species for days. Weeks. Years, probably. But because this is Goodreads and not my personal whale blog I'm instead going to say that this book is a history of whaling more than it is anything else, and while I think it's a worthwhile read for that history alone, if you love whales or any manner of marine life, be prepared to be angry and sad while you read it. Be prepared, too, for learning (or being reminded anew) how utterly phenomenal whales really are. [Four stars for such a deep dive into the heart of my favorite oceanic creature + one of my all-time favorite books, and for these resilient, sentient, stunning mammals that will forever be more amazing than any of us on land.]"
20,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,3,"A whale is one of nature's most mysterious creatures. Its hulking presence is mostly invisible to man, since it resides under the surface of the sea until the need for air forces the creature to surface. I believe Philip Hoare has a reverence for the animal, however this book traces the history of the cetacean's encounter with mankind; a savagely violent story. It is only in the last few decades that observing whales has become more of a human pastime than killing them for their oil and other substances useful to industry. Still, they have been and are still being hunted mercilessly to the brink of extinction. Reading of the intimate details of whale hunts upset me. They are sentient creatures quite able to experience pain and terror. If only I could blot out those images in my mind's eye or that the magnificent creatures had never suffered so greatly."

22,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2738830-tom-stallard,2,"It's hard to know exactly what the aims of the author were with this book. Is it a travelogue, a journey through the authors eyes in the footsteps of Herman Melville, in a similar light to the excellent writing of Tony Horwitz, is it an literary exploration of Moby Dick, or is it simply an exploration of whaling and the whale. I'm not sure the author knows, and is desperately hoping that if he writes in emulation of what was the new and unique voice used in Moby Dick, perhaps you won't notice.This is, perhaps, ultimately a biblical study. The author admits that he reads Moby Dick in the same way as a Muslim reads the Qur'an. The confused narrative has the feel of someone justifying their own writings by pulling text randomly from the bible, seeking the justification of a higher power, in this case the knowledge of Melville. That's not to say that the book isn't very well written in places, it is just that it seems to step outside of the voice of the author again and again, back into the phraseology of someone seeking past justification. Ishmael is used continually as a source, alongside real people and real stories. The Whale is seen as a being itself, as powerful as in Melville's story, but we are told exactly what a Real Whale is - it is not a Blue Whale, or Fin Whale, that are too large, to difficult to catch, or a Right Whale, that is too easy. Only a Sperm Whale counts, because it becomes part of the epic, noble, disguising, industrial and ultimately confused battle between man and beast.This is where the book ultimately fails. It is desperate to explain to us that this is a battle of true importance, but can neither pick sides, constantly romanising and demonising both Whale and Whaler, or provide a objective view of either. It tries too hard to capture the same mysticism that it often references within Moby Dick, and as a result fails to be objective, but at the same time tries to provide an authentic document of the past, without providing dispassionate grounding for the reader."
23,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5465456-j-d-field,5,"So, I have to preface this with the information that ever since I can remember I've been obsessed with the natural world. Recently my focus has been whales. I based an entire holiday around it (see more of my adventure here)and I wrote a novel of my own all about them (The Water Book.)Given all of this, I was predisposed to love Leviathan. If you have any kind of magpie mind you'll find something to spark your interest here. It's crammed with astonishing facts about beasts that are already fascinating. There is great harshness, too. The narrative is structured around the history of man's interaction with whales, and it hasn't been nice...My problem with this book is also it's greatest strength. The magnificence and otherworldliness of whales is astonishingly hard to line into words, but Hoare manages this. One phrase of his describing a humpback as a 'barnacled angel' I thought really lovely.But he goes too far, and is too personal. Often its frustrating and intrusive and I felt the urge to snap at him to back out of the story. He's less interesting than the whales, unsuprisingly, but doesn't seem aware of this.And the photos are grainy and black and white. A bit of colour and gloss would have been nice.Still, though, Leviathan gets 5 stars, because I'm unashamedly biased. And I think everybody should read it. Everybody in the world needs to know more about these largest inhabitants of the world ever, and how mysterious their comings and goings are in the entirely unknown and secret depths and wastes of the ocean. Because they're amazing, and it's time we started being a bit nicer to them..."

I began my college career as a marine biology major, and clung to it until I was done in by calculus and the prospect of Organic Chemistry. I read Moby Dick in my junior year of college, and still regret not doing a semester at sea before changing my major to humanities. Reading The Whale brought back fond memories of the paper I wrote on Moby Dick, my first whale watch, and marine science field trips on Boston Harbor. The Whale is a biography of the range of leviathans lived under our seas, engagingly but thoroughly written by whale enthusiast Hoare. In the Dickensonian tradition, it begins with his boyhood fear of water and fascination with creatures of the deep that extends into adulthood and carries him through his first whale watch and beyond. In the first 50 pages alone, Hoare covers a whirlwind of history and biology, interspersed with literary allusions to Moby Dick, a source of inspiration. Hoare sets off to visit the places from Melville’s novel, and traces the natural and cultural history of the whale along the way.The well written, award-winning narration is very long in tooth. While I'm enjoying the richness of the book, Hoare is a little redundant, and some may become be frustrated with the flowery tone and exaltations of this wondrous mammal (Hoare confesses to running out of adjectives). Patient armchair travelers and natural history buffs will be delighted with this tome."

To be honest, though, I skimmed the last 25%. His writing is beautiful but I had a few issues that kept me from enjoying the book as much as I had hoped.First, it got a bit repetitive. My second issue, related to the first, is that there was quite a bit of detailed accounts of killing and butchering whales. I understand that part of this is to show the true nature of the whaling industry and how we learned about whale biology. However, it got excessive and I read several passages that seemed really long with a horrified expression on my face - it got to the point where it amused my husband. Third, there was A LOT about Moby Dick, which I have never read.On the other hand, Hoare's love for whales is evident in his descriptions and the amount of research that went into this book. I did appreciate learning about the history of whaling and research on whales. Even more, I treasured the parts about whale anatomy, communication, and community structure. Those were by far my favorite parts. Overall, I am glad I read the book but I am ready to move on. "
26,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/1408980.htmlA good historical and literary survey of whaling: Hoare chases down all sorts of information about whales and their exploitation by humans; I had forgotten just how bad things had got in the 1970s before the whaling ban came into force (as far as it did); but it's also amazing just how little is known about whales, because of the difficulty of carrying out direct research on them. Hoare also reflects on Herman Melville and the composition of his great work, and even tracks down a specific whale skeleton in Yorkshire which is explicitly mentioned in Moby-dick. I've only had one encounter with whales, and I have to admit that I found it rather difficult to process exactly what I was seeing; the scale of the creature is just so large that I wasn't quite sure how to interpret the evidence of my senses. Anyway, Hoare helped me make sense of it all, though Melville's book is better."
27,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,4,"This is an absolutely superb book, it covers pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about whales and man's relationship with them and the roles they have played not just in the world of business but also in that of politics and literature . Hoare has an obvious passion for whales and this comes through in his writing, which is descriptive and engrossing, even during the whaling scenes when you want to look away but can't. Melville's Moby Dick obviously appears a lot in this book, as quotes, references and comparisons with the real world but this adds depth to this epic tale that would otherwise have been dominated by blood shed and man's ever determined battle to conquer nature. This is a great read whether you've read Moby Dick or not (which I haven't but now really really want to) and takes the reader on the fascinating journey of the whale and it's ever present power over mankind."

Like Melville's Ishmael, Hoare swims through libraries and sails over oceans. Unlike Ishmael, he also goes swimming with whales, not just any whales either, Folio whales. Along the way he reveals how our confused thinking about and knowledge of this most charismatic and mythic of marine mammals has changed in the last century and a half. We now know, for instance, that Melville was wrong about the great sperm whale's silence (they echolocate with clicks), and we have better ideas about what all that spermaceti is for. Along with Melville's, the influence of Sebald's ""Rings of Saturn"" can be felt, especially in those chapters in which Hoare walks among whale bones (some still dripping oil) and grainy photographs. Hoare opens the flood gates to the wonder world but leavens his wonder with elegy. A beautiful book."
29,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86530-james,5,"This is probably one of the most best reads I've had in a long time. I felt dedicated to this book while reading it. Philip Hoare is a enthusiastic, hugely knowledgeable author who writes movingly and poetically about his own love of whales and their place in both their own and human history. This book is fascinating, with so many tales, whether they are from anecdotes, old scientific papers, literature or modern research studies.Hoare's look at the history of whaling is especially good, highlighting the insanity of the industry and their attitudes to some of the most beautiful creatures in the world.Despite having an interest in whales, I think anyone should read this book, it was hugely informative, revealing, entertaining and even touching in places.(DISCLAIMER: I am a bit obsessed with whales so this book appeals to me hugely)"
30,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126378-tom,4,"This book spent a bit more time dissecting Moby Dick and Melville's life than I expected, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing, although it was a curveball. Otherwise, it was pretty fascinating, at least if, like me, you have any interest in whales/the sea at all. Like many contemporary books that hone in one a specific subject, sometimes it goes too far in trying to prove that *this subject* is the most important one in world history (ie- whales are at the heart of everything), but most of the time, Hoare keeps things in proper perspective, and pushes the writing along with just enough of a narrative, and a style that is smart and funny without being intrusive or ostentatious. Also, it gives you the opportunity to bombard your wife with whale facts, which I can only assume she enjoyed hearing. "
31,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4417002-anna,5,"WOW. The WHALE. Or, ""Ah, the world, oh the whale.""Philip Hoare is a passionate storyteller and ridiculously engaging. Part memoir, part history, part travelogue, part natural history, part literary criticism (for all you lovers of Moby Dick!)--this is the kind of nonfiction I go for. But, careful--this is not a beach read. What we have done to the whales is painful, and while I read and thought about this enormous and mysterious animal of the deep, I also had a sick feeling. What Alex Ross said is true: the book ""inspires both awe and shame--awe of the whales, shame of the human species that has tried to destroy them."" And, I agree with Ross, too: ""In the end, Hoare's virtuosic sympathy for his subject makes you believe in the better angels of our nature."" I hope so."

Philip Hoare has a wonderful, poetic way of writing, and his own love for and fascination with whales come over with every word. This isn't just a scientific book about whales; it's an exploration of the whale in human history, religion, literature. He talks about Melville's Moby-Dick as much as whaling and the whale itself, and it just works. It's an incredibly moving read at times too, particularly when he talks about what man has done to the whale. This is a wonderful book. "

I read about the history of whaling, mostly US and Great Britian. (Hoare spends his time in both places.) Some of the chapters containe less marine science, more social history, with discussions about mid 20th-century movie production of -Moby Dick- and various museums which were completely/partly dedicated to whaling history. Great detail. Clear ecological concerns. Use of humor. Concrete explanations. A good, solid beginning place to learn about the social history ofm whaling."

38,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59749051-andrew-benesh,4,"A Fascinating, Deeply Personal Examination of Man's Relationship with WhalesI must admit this book is somewhat difficult for me to review, because it was not what I was expecting. I came to it expecting a natural history of whales, perhaps with some intersections with human history and broader ecological themes. While the book does have some chapters about whales, it's really a social history of whaling, as told through the lens of Herman Melville and Moby Dick. It also interweaves the author's personal experiences with coming to understand whales, and how they have factored in to major life experiences for him. The result is a book that is at once both deeply informative and challenging to read. Once the reader accepts that the book will only have two chapters on whale biology (and that these are more about historical understandings of whale biology), the reader must accept that the book doesn't follow a clear historical timeline; at various points the reader will jump back and forth between the 1600s, the 1800s, and modern times, often without much warning. The reader must also navigate an ambiguous ""I""; sometimes this refers to the narrators experience, but sometimes it reflects Melville's character of Ishmael (in passages that are not always properly typeset to indicate they are quotes). The reader is also treated to a considerably more in depth discussion of the relationship between Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne than you might expect from the cover of the book. The author, perhaps because he has been reading a lot of older sources, sometimes uses language that might not be approachable for casual readers; for example there are numerous references to ""cachalots"" (sperm whales), and at least one questionable usage of the phrase ""whales a la mode"". However, this poetic license does help embed the reader in the world of whalers. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't note that the author does seem to have some sexual preoccupations within the book; there's a higher number of references to whale penises, homosexual relationships among sailors (and narhwals), and some rather sensual descriptions of whale bodies. I think these themes are fair to include, particularly as they challenge some exclusionary narratives about sex and gender, but they were unexpected.Despite these shortcomings, the book is FASCINATING, and I'm very glad that I read it. Hoare does a remarkable job explaining the historical perspectives of whalers, Melville's fragmentary knowledge of whales, and showing how larger social, political, and economic forces shaped our relationship with whales. I think readers will benefit greatly from understanding why whaling was such an important industry in its time, and the challenges that have accompanied a transition to a post-whaling technological society. I was impressed with how the author handles the complexities of the intersection between whaling and slavery, as well as larger conversations about race and class. The later chapters which address modern whaling, particularly by Japan and Norway, had a good balance of political cynicism and cultural sensitivity. The chapters on the processing of whale carcasses, and the scientific community's struggles to understand and preserve whales felt appropriately foreign to how we talk about whales today, yet were conveyed with authenticity and insight.However, what really makes this book worth reading is the author's clear love of the subject. It is immediately apparent to the reader that the author is truly enamored with whales, and captivated by our relationship with them. You can feel is frustration with our abuses of whales, and his excitement to share anecdotes about our complex relationship with them. The author's cautious hopefulness is particularly resonant in the final chapters, and his account of diving with whales is mesmerizing. I'd love to see a follow up book that explores the lives of whales and the author's relationship with them more fully, though perhaps that's better reflected in his BBC special ""The Hunt for Moby Dick"". If you understand that what you're getting into is a book about man's relationship with whales, then you'll find this enjoyable. If you're looking for a more straightforward whale biology book, you'll probably be disappointed. If you do take a chance on this book, be warned - you might find Hoare's love for these creatures and our relationship with them is contagious!"

The book somehow manages to be both learned and moving while maintaining the fundamental mystery of cetaceans. It also enriches one's understanding Melville's unparalleled novel - which is the great American novel - without drowning its mysterious beauty in the narrow and tired jargon of so much contemporary literary criticism.

Mr. Hoare is an inveterate poet, whose language and passion charge a difficult and obscure subject with a shining passion that is difficult to match. Hoare goes spelunking into the topic of whaling and cetaceans more broadly through the vector of Melville's ""Moby Dick,"" but brings the whales he studies to life in a way I would argue has never been done before to my knowledge. The book weaves a skein of biology, literature, economy, geography, history, and philosophy, deftly challenging the reader to look inside himself and truly understand brutality against beauty for savage gain. Compel yourself to track down this book; I am fortunate to have been pressed to read it by a friend. "
46,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,4,"To really enjoy this book, it really helps to be a fan of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Much of The Whale is devoted to that novel and its author and how the book came to be written, along with a history of the whaling industry. That history is focused mainly on the New England whalers of Massachusetts, who hunted whales both in the local waters off the coast and eventually all over the world. It's also heavily centered on their primary prey, which was the sperm whale -- Moby Dick was, of course, a sperm whale.The greatest surprise that I had in reading this book was that the whaling industry did not peak and then decline in the nineteenth century, as I thought, but rather in the twentieth. Once the technology of finding and killing whales was perfected, with sonar and GPS and explosive harpoon charges and factory ships, the slaughter of whales reached unprecedented heights, dwarfing the numbers of whales taken a century earlier with much more primitive techniques. Only once the populations of whales began to plummet in the second half of the 20th century did the whaling nations get together and begin to drastically restrict the hunt. Of course, not all countries took part in the agreement and not all of them observed either its letter or its spirit -- Norway, Iceland, Japan, hang your head in shame. But most whale species are finally recovering and the whale watching industry has now become much more lucrative than the business of whale killing.All in all, a good read for devotees of really, really big marine mammals, and of Moby Dick."
47,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3431713-blue,5,"A behemoth of a book about the behemoth of the animal kingdom, the whale. Hoare weaves literary criticism of Moby-Dick, the life of this other behemoth's writer, Melville, the history of whaling, and the history of the accumulation of human knowledge of the whale in one big personal book. I say personal, because as he recount the intertwined history of man/whale, hunter/pray, consumer/commodity, Hoare is acutely aware of the human legacy that he is, like all of us, a part of.Despite the heft of information in The Whale, there is surprisingly little one learns about these elusive animals, which reinforces one of the major points of the author, that we know little of whales, and whatever we know, we know from hunting and killing them. With many species endangered and extinct, studying the whale is again difficult, and ultimately, sadly, it seems to me that we don't care that much, anyway. For most of our governments (for it matters little how individuals really feel), the whale has been a great commodity. And beyond that, like all animals, it has no real value. But beside the sadness of the subject of the book, the history and information told by Philip Hoare in The Whale make for a great read, full of interesting tidbits about several countries, several literary figures, and many many awesome whales.Recommended for readers who like animals, history of science, shipwrecks, and economics."
48,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31310-charlie,3,"Hoo-whee. This book was exasperating. At times I wanted to throw it out the window it would make me so mad. But in the end, the sum exceeded its parts. And after flip flopping from 4 stars to 2 stars... I've rated it 3, but that doesn't reflect how good it is in some ways.Hoare has bitten off a lot here which is why its a frustrating read at times and exhilarating in the end. Its a love story/biography of whales in our culture. And at the end, his passion wins you over. But on the way, he is trying to weave science and animal biology with the history and horrors of the whaling industry, the biography of Herman Melville, literary criticism of Moby Dick, and personal anecdotes of his own travels and encounters with the great leviathans. In the process, especially in the early chapters, he is jumping around mid-paragraph thematically that you have no idea how or why he got from point A to B. The man can write a beautiful sentence tho and his passion seeps thru every word. Some of his metaphors and similes had me smiling agog at their vividness.So in the end, if you are a hearty soul, and can withstand the chaotic turbulent waves of his passionate writing, at the end, you will reach the end of your journey thru The Whale and arrive at a safe harbor satisfied and moved.Hmmm, now of what book from the 19th century does that experience remind me?

49,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3097697-maxine,3,"This book had moments of brilliance; the second half definitely picked up compared to the first. The problem lies in the fact that I'm not interested in the history of Moby Dick or Herman Melville. (Although, the relationship between Melville and Hawthorne is... interesting to say the least.) But when the book got to the horrors of commercial whaling and whale captivity, I could not put it down. Terrible stuff & very eye opening. There is a lot of interesting information scattered throughout the book, so I wouldn't really recommend skipping parts (even though the beginning was a slog for me). I definitely understand his reverence for the leviathan. It is a particularly good time to read about whales as the treatment of them and their responses to said treatment has recently become very topical. "
50,0061976210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99666-audrey,4,"Philip Hoare walks a fine line in this book between natural history and personal narrative, with a big dose of Melville and Moby Dick. I wanted a few more scientific details now and then, but overall, I really enjoyed his ruminations on whales, and our relationship with whales. He examines how they live in our imaginings and stories since they're so elusive in real life, and how we built an entire economy on them, up to how they're doing now in an (almost) post-whaling age. My own whale watching trip was canceled due to gale force winds (My boyfriend was incredulous: ""What, that bothers the whales?"" ""No, silly! It bothers the boat!""), but Hoare takes us on his at the end of the book - what a treat! I also appreciated how the book was written for a (perhaps slightly literary) general audience since my maritime knowledge is pretty paltry."

I only wish two things: 1. that I had the paperback, not the text-only ebook version, and could gaze upon all the pictures of lovely whales, and 2. that it had been more about whales, and less about whaling.The whaling stuff was great, just hard. As a visceral and exploratory industry which intersected uncomfortably with the slave trade, it evokes many uneasy truthes concerning man's ambitions and violence and reckless destruction. It was very upsetting to read. All I was looking for was whale fact fun! ""WHALE FACT: the world's whales consume the same weight in sea life as the fishing industry!"" that kind of thing.

The timeline covered is huge, and to keep things more exciting and feeling less like a textbook, Hoare bounces back and forth through the years, from early sea serpent stories, to the U.S. Revolution, Melville, Poe, Stoker, and modern marine life studies. The vast amount of science fact is also delicately balanced with the personal stories of whalers involved, writers influenced, and the towns and cultures that were changed by the whaling trade."

I was hoping for a natural history, peppered with stories about the people who study whales, especially because a whale biologist friend of mine is featured in this book. However, Hoare seems to be madly in love with Melville, and Moby Dick references weigh heavily throughout. Hoare also uses unnecessary linguistic flourishes and draws many improbable conclusions, presumably because they sound poetic. Instead of a natural history, this book reads like a 400-page freshman essay on Melville. The whale's own stories are lost in Hoare's bombastic prose."

Skimmed rapidly to the end, found occasionally interesting facts, but now I'm DONE and I'm glad.I learned much more about whalers and whaling-- in a much more direct and accessible style-- from Nathanael Philbrick's ""In the Heart of the Sea.""

He also spends a lot of time cataloging the disturbing details of the whaling industry: I was particularly struck by how whalers would use a whale's blubber to fuel the fires that rendered the rest of the animal's fat. On whaling ships, whales would cook themselves. Hoare also has a good ear for lush language. Listen to him on page 290: ""And how to convey that magnitude, that mass of whalish flesh, that cavern of ceiling-high baleen?""

It's well written, one might even say lyrical, although this sometimes descends into the maudlin. It is suspended somewhere between literary memoir and science writing, and is more interesting than many natural history books because of the hybrid character. Recommended."
