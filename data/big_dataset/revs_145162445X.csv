0,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
1,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
2,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
3,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

4,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
5,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
6,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

8,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
9,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
10,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
11,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
12,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
13,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
14,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
15,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
16,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
17,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
18,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
19,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
20,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
21,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
22,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

24,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
25,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

26,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
27,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
28,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
29,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.

30,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376052-lois-keller,3,"I would like to first that Lawrence Krauss is a very intelligent man and that I have a lot of respect for him as an author, scientist, and intellectual.  Secondly, this book was somewhat an enigma to me (bear with me for a few before marking me as a English major with little science background). I went into reading this book with my own well formed bias and skepticism towards the subject matter - can something can from nothing? Why this book is an enigma is that Krauss wants to support his arguments as backed by well reasoned, scientifically sound arguments, but he often contradicts himself and oversimplifies the material in order to do so to appeal to a larger audience. The contradictions are subtle, for instance, he goes into great detail early on in the book about how usually the scientific community is highly skeptic and harsh towards new science and should be, but then he bases a good portion of his argument on Stephen Hawking's postulates on how something can come from nothing. Now as a scientist, I want experimental verification for these theories before I fully accept them and the theories that branch from the original. Krauss would probably love to go into detail and full mathematical explanations in his book, but he doesn't, and by generalizing his subject matter, he loses some of his validity (in my mind). Am I convinced that something can come from nothing and we no longer need the existence of a good to support the creation of the universe? Not in the slightest; however, Krauss did make me think about this topic and question my own personal beliefs and rationalizations.  What I really took from this book and grew from was Einstein's opinion on the origins of the universe about half way through the book - ""For Einstein, the existence of order in the universe provided a sense of such profound wonder that he felt a spiritual attachment to it, which he labeled with the moniker ""God"""" This struck me as such a beautiful concept and phrased in a way that I had been previously unable to do so - God is a representation of the structure of our universe. There is nothing to suggest that God is an active presence in our daily lives; yet, there may be something to that God is a term used to describe the ultimate simplicity and relational concepts that define physics - God is what makes things work, what connects aspects of our lives to the reality we perceive. I guess God could be the Grand Unified Theorem (I'm sure that would be a well received publication title...).  Overall, I enjoyed this book. Krauss keeps it relatively focused, and even if you hate thinking philosophically about the origins of the universe or about the science behind it, I believe you could still find enjoyment in A Universe from Nothing. I would really recommend this to anyone - it's a solid 3.5 stars and is definitely an intellectual and thought provoking read with a lot of excellent science nuggets of gold in it. As a physicist, I craved more mathematical reasoning and maybe even a few paper citations, but as a member of a general public, I appreciate Krauss's ability to explain things without losing his audience. "
31,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838986-amy,1,"This book was half academic circle jerking and half wannabe Dawkins posturing. 1. I was too dumb to understand the majority of the nitty gritty science. You can tell me that the universe is flat based on geometry and I'll believe you; you're just wasting my time if you try to impress me with equations. 2. Knowing that I'm too dumb for this book made me wonder who he was writing it for. I'm not unintelligent, even if my background is in English and not in physics. There's just enough raw science in here that I'd think a layman would be confused and just enough simplistic analogies that say he's writing for the layman, after all. 3. Half of the time is spent nodding at his colleagues' work, his own work, and the ""silly"" work of others in misguided fields. There's a long sojourn where he talks smack on string theory. It's some of the most condescending writing I've seen. He tries to say he still respects them, but for every ""String theorists are intelligent men and women"" concession, he'll follow it up with a ""So just let them have their little vain moment in the sun"" comment. I'm not interested. 4. Can't stress enough how much of this book is just ""I know that important guy"" and ""I was the one who organized the conference where that dude spoke"" and ""My work on ____."" Is this a book for the masses or an excuse for you to flout your CV, Krauss? 5. I am not one to feel offended when someone tries to prove there isn't a god. I'm the person who goes out and buys Dawkins so I can better argue against churchgoers. But I did not pick up this book for a philosophical debate about the existence of God. It's not what I wanted. Say your piece, Krauss, and if you want to go full Hitchens and outline why God doesn't exist, then write a different book. His arguments felt completely out of place. 6. Let me summarize: The universe is still expanding. In a trillion years, anyone's who's alive in the universe will not be able to see beyond their own galaxy. They'll think they're alone and anyone who suspects otherwise will not be able to prove it. We live in a special time, a small (relatively speaking) window of roughly a billion years where we can trace the origin of the Big Bang, know that we are one of many billion galaxies, and are able to study starstuff that will eventually cease to exist. It is postulated that the universe will end as it began: by one day jumping from one state to another. One day, it will cease to exist. There is something now. There will be nothing later. But, because it's been proven (or the possibility is so dramatically high that it's practically proven) that you can create something from nothing, who's to say another Big Bang won't happen when our universe dies? It could. It might not. It probably will. The cycle would begin anew. However it all ends, it will be mathematically beautiful. That's it. That's all you need to know. Thank me for saving you hours of your life."
32,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,2,"This is a difficult book to review. On one hand, Krauss is an enthralling and clear science writer. He gives great descriptions of how the universe works, about conditions in the early moments in the universe that led to what we see today, and (my favorite, because it was new to me!) what the very old universe will look like and how it will be in a state that will make any observers assume the universe is the way humans actually thought it was back in the 1800s. (!!) This was all interesting, fun, wild stuff. On the other hand... wow. Simply put, Krauss frames his entire book as doing something he does not, and in fact cannot, do. His entire premise is that he is showing how the universe came into existence from Nothing, but unfortunately this is a question outside the realm of science. It is philosophy, and in most ways it is pure speculation. Everything Krauss claims to be ""nothing"" -- ""empty"" space, the bits right before the Big Bang instantiated space itself, etc. -- are nowhere near the definition of ""Nothing"" that is at the heart of the question he claims to tackle and claims to answer. Certainly, not the Nothing that philosophy starts with (philosophers are much more careful and precise about their terms). Krauss redefines the concept to fit what he wants it to be and what will help him ""prove"" his argument, rather than honestly confronting the real question. It was very disappointing.Now, if Krauss had set out to demonstrate that the universe can operate, from its initial starting ""stuff,"" without the intervention of a supernatural Being, then Krauss did so. Excellently and fascinatingly. But instead, since he set out to answer a question science is not equipped to answer, I cannot give the book the stars this truly excellent science writing deserves. Another huge problem for me: throughout, Krauss dismissed and almost mocked philosophy, undermining its legitimacy as a form of inquiry. Despite that, he insisted on engaging (poorly) in philosophy through at least half of the book. You cannot dismiss a tool of inquiry and then use it -- poorly, without understanding how to use it properly -- to make your point. I kept thinking things like ""stay your lane,"" ""respect the fields you don't know,"" and ""by the way, it's cheating to move the goalposts.""As a book on science, this was quite good. I learned a lot, reinforced or recalled other things I had learned from other laymen physics books, and found many new questions to ask my physicist husband. As a book purportedly answering -- answering!! -- the question of ""Why is there something rather than Nothing?"", it is almost offensively and laughably bad. "
33,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"Lawrence Krauss catches us all up on the latest in cosmology with his rare combination of professional expertise, ability to explain difficult concepts, and sense of humor. The first portion of the book follows the history of astronomy and cosmology to present, showcasing the bold ideas, both successful and failed, that have brought us to our current understanding of the universe we live in. These concepts are explained very well, and his account filled many gaps in my understanding. I'm extremely happy I finished this book prior to watching the film Particle Fever, about the building of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs Boson, as it gave me better footing upon which to appreciate that story.As Krauss begins to drive home his thesis and discuss current insights into the energy contained within empty space, he brings in pieces of information that he has personally had a hand in elucidating. He does a great job of separating what we know for sure from what might be the case, and then explores the implications of each. All of this is set against the classic question that book-ends all of existence: ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" Citing science's penchant for answering ""how"" questions far more effectively, Krauss examines the alternate questions that could make sense to even answer, and compares those questions with the far less satisfying speculations theology has provided.As the book wanders into complicated discussion of time-traveling electrons that shoot back into the present with self-annihilating antimatter in tow, or the implications of a closed or open or flat universe that might spring into existence for varying levels of time, I'll admit he goes well over my head. I found myself re-reading a number of pages to grasp the concepts, and sometimes just had to kind of nod and move along. I won't fault Krauss's explanatory powers, as he explains other concepts so well - I'll fault my own lack of experience with quantum physics and relativity, and the inherent complexity of those topics.Highly recommended for those wanting a fuller picture of particle physics and cosmology, or who wish to have conversations that involve such things."
34,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Krauss comes out swinging, calling theism morally bankrupt, and poo-pooing ""first cause"" as a cop out.The first half of the book is a very good explanations for lay or studied person.Later on, though, the author beats his thesis like a dead horse with a floppy philosophy stick.I got really tired of hearing the phrase ""something from nothing"".I was curious why he insists space is precisely flat.Experiments like BOOMERanG show it is very nearly flat.But then again, the gravitational constant is very nearly zero compared to the other forces.Nearly zero can only be called zero when zero is otherwise an important prediction, like the rest mass of a photon.While it's a safe guess that our limit for the curvature will continue to approach zero, it is by no means a certainty!Krauss seems to imply otherwise, an in my opinion, mistakenly so.In the end of the book, he gives a shockingly poor answer to Einstein's question:Did got have a choice in creating the universe?He responds with a sort of anthropic argument, that if the universe were much different, there would be nobody around to ask the question.This is clearly not true for computer scientists, who, if they're like me, create toy universes all the time.Their made-up laws of nature may be simple, and the results may be trifling compared to, and by definition are lesser than, our universe.But they are universes, just the same.Chess, Conway's game of life, Richard Dawkin's Biomorphs, any Minecraft map, and the World of Warcraft are all universes, with their own laws.None of them incorporate quantum mechanics, or have an Einstein in them, however.Idea: Build Einstein in Mincraft!My favorite part of the book was the terrifying story of the impoverished physicists living 2 trillion years from now.They will have no traces of dark energy, or the big bang, because the CMBR will have red-shifted out of view.Poor guys."
35,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3465909-ronald,3,"Like poetry, an abstruse scientific work need not be fully comprehended to enjoy it. This somewhat arcane audio book, well read by its author, theoretical physicist & cosmologist Larry Krauss, sheds just enough familiar photons to guide the layman through the maze of dark matter, quantum fluctuation, event horizons, and The Singularity. I was especially keen on Dr. Krauss's discussion of the philosophical implications of evidenced-based findings about the expanding universe... no gods required or allowed.In recent years, many scientists have challenged the ""non-overlapping magisteria"" (NOMA), proffered by Stephen Jay Gould, noted paleontologist and evolutionary biologist. Science no longer cedes the forum to the unsubstantiated assertions of religion about life and the cosmos. Thus is upended the unfalsifiable claim that religion ""knows"" the world in ways different from science, but equally valid.The Afterword by evolutionary biologist and ethologist Richard Dawkins is powerful corroboration of this important work from an evolutionary biologist's perspective. I found the book worthwhile; and given enough space-time, if I read a lot more of this stuff, my understanding will surely expand along with the universe."
36,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308179-jerry,2,"I found this book rather disappointing. It does shed some light on the promised question of why the universe exists, but very little. I found his writing not nearly as good as that of Brian Greene. Krauss seems to have an inflated ego that intrudes into the narrative all too often.One of the things I found most annoying is that he repeatedly and foolishly wandered off his scientific discourse into a discussion on theology where he attempts to show that there is no room for God in creation. I found this quote revealing: ""All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians."" He forgot to include that scientists may not be as clever as they think. He fails to recognize that he is really taking on faith that four significant digits of accuracy. The scientific theory only lasts as long as the next contradictory experimental result. After all, even the great Einstein himself was wrong about his cosmological constant. "

38,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9924189-james-kane,2,"Originally published just under a year ago, Lawrence Krauss' A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing (2012) grapples with one of the oldest and most complex questions confronting scientists, philosophers and theologians everywhere: is it possible for something to come from nothing? Drawing on key developments in modern physics, several of which are indebted to his own research and published scholarship, Krauss argues and demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, our universe can have emerged literally from nothing 13.72 billion years ago without violating any time-honoured notions of what is logical or physically possible. Although this argument fascinates and offers an important corrective to one of the longest-standing tenets of human intellectual history (i.e. that nothing can come from nothing, so to speak), the book for the most part constitutes a rehash of a scientific adventure story that has been covered numerous times in works by various other science writers. To be fair to Krauss, the retelling of this narrative is virtually inevitable, since explaining and promoting radical new ideas in this field requires a summary of the most important research that has gone before. While authors like Brian Greene and Stephen Hawking manage to structure ""the story so far"" effectively and recount its key developments in an engaging way, Krauss often lacks clarity in his writing, failing at times to explain certain crucial concepts or to show non-specialist readers exactly how one discovery led to another. The main point of the book is a significant, even revolutionary one. (Though I should point out here that Krauss is by no means the first scientist to mention the idea in a work aimed at a wider audience, even if he may be the first to make it the focus of a whole book.) Cosmologists still have a huge amount of work to do in order to clarify exactly how the universe began, but for the first time in human history we have reached a point where it is not only plausible but legitimate to envisage an origin scenario where matter came into existence out of the unstable, unpredictable quantum energy of empty space. In stressing this point, A Universe from Nothing has the potential to make a real and (crucially) accessible contribution to general understanding of the enormous, truly ancient world we live in. This is exactly what a ""popular science"" book should do. Unfortunately, in addition to championing an intriguing recent theory about the origins of existence, Krauss explicitly adopts a stance throughout which reduces the purpose of the book to something more akin to that of an anti-religious polemic.Now, just like Krauss, I'm also happy to admit ""in the interests of full disclosure ... that I am not sympathetic to the conviction that creation requires a creator, which is at the basis of all the world's religions"" (p. xi). I'm also happy to admit that I was brought up Catholic and went to church until well into my early teens, and that I had stopped believing in ""God"", as such, by the time I left school, though I can't claim to be able to single out any particular point where I self-consciously renounced my faith. Despite that, however, studying the history of a whole range of different people whose entire socio-cultural and even political framework was (and in some cases still is) inextricably bound up with their religious beliefs has made me intensely wary of the whole ""science v. religion"" debate simply because the latter has played such a fundamental role in both the collective and individual human experience. While science may be defined as truth obtained through reason and religion as truth received through revelation, the fact remains that both of them, essentially, are based on ideas - and there can be no going forward unless people in opposing camps are willing to give each other's ideas genuine consideration. In The Coming of the Third Reich (2005), the brilliant first volume of his three-part study of the rise and fall of the Nazi Party, English historian Richard Evans argues that the only way to understand how Hitler's party could have gained control of Germany and wreaked havoc on Europe is to take Nazi ideas seriously, no matter how distasteful that may be. Theologians and scientists, I would argue (probably from a very biased perspective, but that can't be helped), could follow the historian's advice here and adopt the same approach. The exchange and serious discussion of ideas is one of the most profitable and most enjoyable things about being human, especially in an age where we know so much more about the world than we have ever known before. Krauss outlines some truly amazing and oddly beautiful ideas in this book. It is sad, then, that he detracts from the lustre of the ideas themselves by making frequent and thinly veiled denigrating remarks about religious conceptions of the origins of the universe. The content of A Universe from Nothing is endlessly intriguing, but the way in which Krauss forces it into the sardonic straitjacket of his anti-religious message mars the book even more than its other defects. A typically smug and caustic afterword by Richard Dawkins only makes things worse. Dawkins calls this book ""the knockout blow"" against religious ideas about the beginning, finishing the work begun by Darwin's roundhouse kick to ""supernaturalism"" on behalf of biology and the flurry of strikes landed by numerous scientists in between. Although Krauss has proved that it is no longer necessary to explain the universe through the agency of a creator, he does note, at least, that there is still much that we don't know, and perhaps won't ever know, about how everything came into existence all those billions of years ago. Dawkins' crowing pugilistic imagery on the other hand suggests that he himself has not read the book all that closely after all, or indeed grasped one of the most important lacunae in the ongoing debate between scientists and theologians. Dawkins can claim all he likes that theology lies bruised and bleeding on the floor while science pumps its fists in the air and basks in the adulation of a cheering crowd of onlookers, but the only certain truth right now is that the fight has only just begun.(Note: Being a grumpy, old-fashioned devotee of physical books, I didn't actually read the ebook - this edition was the only one I could find that has the same cover as my paperback.)"
39,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5576926-david,4,"Krauss's big idea in ""A Universe from Nothing"" is that starting with only space-time and all the laws of physics (e.g. quantum mechanics and general relativity), our universe can be accounted for. He refers to such a starting point as ""nothing"" (a nothing that I believe to be far removed from non-existence). This book is his attempt to neuter ""ex nihilo nihil fit"" as an argument for theism. As a Christian, I'm unsympathetic to Krauss's clear anti-theistic agenda and the biases that come along with it -- nevertheless, I couldn't help but enjoy this book. If anything, it's a clearly written and infotaining current snapshot of the best atheistic thinking on such issues.While Krauss gives a good review of the road by which we've reached our current cosmological understandings, he frequently smacks on the religious for describing the universe as they want it to be (as opposed to how it really is). However, he does a fair share of this himself in the second half of the book. Most of this comes from his dedication to the ""Copernican principle"", which has come to be more generally understood to mean that there is nothing very unusual about our time and place in the universe, or really anything in existence. Defending the Copernican principle leads him to spend lots of time speculating on various ""anthropic principle"" enabling theories. It's the old idea that the only universes in which minds could question their existence are those same universes that just happen to support conscious existence. The goal of the argument is to therefore assert that we're not unlikely at all, since a myriad of other universes must exist in which no one was around to ask the question. Under this principle, unlikeliness is not allowed, and many (usually untestable) assumptions will be made to prevent it.It's like when Stephen Hawking in his ""A Brief History of Time"" insisted that an infinite big bang / big crunch cycle would, throughout infinity, assume every possible outcome, thus explaining away the apparent unlikeness of our existence at this moment (however, Krauss and others demonstrated that there is no big crunch, so at least Hawking's ideas were falsifiable). These theories are asserted to be true, not because the science demands it, but because of the philosophical commitment for us and our environment to not be unlikely, because unlikely things (in the absence of a myriad of alternatives) naturally bring the supernatural into the discussion.He brings up some current unknowns, such as ""Why are there three generations of elementary particlesâ the electron, and its heavier cousins the muon and tauon, for example, or the three different sets of quarks, of which the lowest energy set makes up the bulk of matter we find on Earth? Why is gravity so much weaker than the other forces in nature, such as electromagnetism? Why is the proton 2,000 times heavier than the electron?"". So far so good, as these are precisely the kind of things science seeks to explain. But then he goes all anthropic-principle again, and suggests that the answers to these might be that all permutations exist, and that we're just in the universe with those particular constant values. That is every bit as bad as the ""just so"" religious arguments he criticizes. Krauss hypocritically does what he attacks the religious for doing, when he says ""the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from oneâs a priori beliefs, nor the beauty or elegance one ascribes to oneâs theoretical models"", and by quoting Sagan's âExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidenceâ.He smacks on string theory, which I'm happy to see: ""perhaps no theoretical picture has ever so successfully permeated the consciousness of the physics community without having yet demonstrated its ability to successfully resolve a single experimental mystery about nature"". He further explains that over the last 25 years of string theory, ""A 'Theory of Everything' had suddenly become a 'Theory of Anything'!"". But again, he does precisely this with his anthropic arguments based in his speculative (i.e. no stated approach for either predictions or falsification) multiverse assertions.At a few points in the book, Krauss bemoans the fact that in the distant future, due to the expansion of space, evidence for the big bang will not be observable. ""We live at a very special time . . . the only time when we can observationally verify that we live at a very special time!"" He admits that at such a future time, science would ""come up with a completely false picture of the large-scale universe"", but that this false explanation would be better than what religion would give you, of course.All popular atheist books throw a bone to the readers who still demand some semblance of meaning in their lives, and this one is no exception: ""A universe without purpose or guidance may seem, for some, to make life itself meaningless. For others, including me, such a universe is invigorating. It makes the fact of our existence even more amazing, and it motivates us to draw meaning from our own actions and to make the most of our brief existence in the sun, simply because we are here, blessed with consciousness and with the opportunity to do so.""Renowned atheist Richard Dawkins wrote the Afterword section, wanting to make sure the attack on faith was received loud and clear. Dawkins assumes a victory far beyond the reach of Krauss's arguments, summarizing with ""Even the last remaining trump card of the theologian, 'Why is there something rather than nothing?' shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages"". Krauss had wanted Christopher Hitchens to write the forward, but his cancer had progressed too far by that point. Hitchens was no scientist, but then again, the point was to join the attack on theism, something that Hitchens did very well, and with undeniable style. (Everyone left a debate loving Hitchens. Dawkins could have learned a thing or two from him.)I realize this review sounds negative, but I'm giving this book a solid thumbs up."

I would need to read more about the subject to really grasp the understanding how a universe (and multiverse) can came through quantum fluctuations. The prerequisites to creating a universe is 1. space (or a empty ""vessel"" that can hold charge) 2. the law of physics. Once you have that, quantum fluctuations happen because ""nothing is unstable"" and in this unsuitability particles that interact create energy without violating the conservation of energy principle. I can somewhat get that, but I didn't really understand how you can get these particles into a infinitesimal spot that contains all our matter and energy in the universe to create the big bang. Good read for those trying to understand the modern scientific explanation of how the universe came to be. "

So if you feel like a starter to cosmology... thats the book!"
43,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,3,"Scientifically, this is a fascinating book. Philosophically, it is a train wreck.I read a small amount of cosmology and quantum mechanics. Not enough to be anything remotely like an expert, but enough to enjoy the genre with books like, for example, Spooky Action at a Distance, which is a fascinating glimpse into all the various kinds of non-locality. (By the way: the Goodreads insert book/author function is broken for me, or else I'd link to the books I'm mentioning.) Sometimes these books also veer into philosophy. A great example would be The Island of Knowledge, another book by a cosmologist that covers some very similar material to Krauss's book (e.g. the multiverse) and does so with a compellingly sophisticated review of the relevant history and philosophy.But whenever you get a scientist veering outside of their discipline, thing can go pear-shaped quickly and dramatically. This happens even with some writers that I generally agree with quite a lot. For every Frans de Waal competently linking in Freud you also get a Stephen Pinker who--as great as he does in his area of expertise--starts inducing forehead-slapping moments when he wanders into political science and philosophy.But I've never read anybody so catastrophically dense and self-assured as Krauss. (Although, in fairness, that's probably only because I can't stand Dawkins' smug self-satisfied smarm enough to finish a chapter. His afterword in this book is probably the longest single piece of his writing I've read.)Let me give you some very specific examples of what I mean. There are two premises to Krauss's book. One is a scientific premise: it explains how we could potentially get the entire universe via a Big Bang out of a quantuum vacuum. This book is excellent. Another premise is philosophical: it purports to answer the ""ancient question 'why is there something rather than nothing?'"". It does so by (1) redefining ""nothing"" to actually mean something else and (2) redefining ""why"" to actually mean something else. Krauss is very defensive about his sleight of hand. You can always tell his argument is getting thin when the spurious insults and glib put-downs start getting thick. He is especially harsh towards philosophers and theologians (which, bizarrely, he seems to view as basically the same discipline) and especially when they are most right and he is most wrong. His book is not actually about something emerging from nothing. It is about something emerging from the quantum vacuum, which he describves as ""a boiling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence"". Let me ask you, do the phrases ""something from nothing"" and ""something from a boiling brew"" sound identical? No, they do not. Hence, the philosophers are right, Krauss is wrong, and so he isn't even addressing (let alone answering) the question he has posed for himself. He does the same thing, later on, with the word ""why"": ""[I]n science we have to be particularly cautious about ""why"" questions. When we ask, ""Why?"" we usually mean ""How?"" If we can answer the latter, that generally suffices for our purposes."" In other words, not only is he not going to tell you why something comes from nothing, but he's also not going to even try to address the ""why"" question, and instead will answer the ""how"" question and pretend that's just as good.And look, scientifically, it is. If he had just stuck to the science, I'd have enjoyed the book. But instead he spends an awful lot of time axe-grinding with irrelevant insults that make no sense. I get that he likes to argue with teenage Young Earth Creationists or whatever--and hey, everyone needs a hobby--but sprinkling your popular science books with adolescent put-downs just makes you look like a tool. Especially because the target of his ire--a demographic known for the being poor and uneducated--is a textbook example of punching down.In the end, this book is marred by the petulant whining of a spoiled genius who is frustrated of the fact he cannot admit: that his of expertise is not the only one of interest and significance. He can't answer the ""ancient question"" and some people actually are curious about it, and that's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes. He's got a hammer, and his biggest fault with religion really seems to be that it's not a nail.Of course, all of this pales in comparison to Dawkins' eye-roll inducing, over-the-top, ego-stroking afterword. Dawkins in all seriousness praises this book as being on the level of Darwin's ""Origin of Species.""If, on the origin of species was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A Universe from Nothing as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says, and what it says is devastating.Take a breath, there, Dr. Dawkins. You're starting to hyperventilate. What's more embarassing (although this is plenty embarrassing already) is that Dawkins steps face-first into a pretty obvious philosophical conundrum that at least Krauss has the acumen to spot. The problem is this: based on the cosmology in the book, far-future cosmologists using the data available to them would draw the wrong conclusions about the nature of the universe relative to what our cosmologists think today. From Krauss:How do we know the universe is expanding? We measure the recession velocity of distance objects as a function of their distance. However, once all visible objects outside of our local cluster in which we are gravitationally bound, have disappeared from our horizon there will be no longer be any tracers of the expansion: no stars, galaxies, quasars, or even large gas clouds that observers could track. The expansion will be so efficient that it will have removed all objects from our sight that are actually receding from us. Moreover, on a time scale of less than a trillion years or so, all the galaxies in our local group will have coalesced into some large metagalaxy. Observers in the far future will see more or less precisely what observers in 1915 thought they saw: a single galaxy housing their star and their planet surrounded by an otherwise vast, empty, static space. This is a philosophical problem for folks like Krauss because if the validity of science rests on its ability to discern truth and if science predicts that future scientists will be unable to come to the truth by relying on science, then you've got a crisis. Krauss isn't blind to this, and so he make an argument about how science is superior even when it gets the answer wrong because at least it's a rational process. This is all reasonable, and I don't have a problem with Krauss's response. The problem is that Dakwins isn't as bright as Krauss. He notes the exact same problem of the (hypothetical) far-future cosmologist, also seems to recognize that this creates a problem for the authority of science, but then he doubles down and says that science is still superior to religion because it gets the right answers:Theologians may speculate about angels on pinheads or whatever is the current equivalent. Physicists might seem to have their own angels and their own pinheads, quanta and quarks, charm, strangeness, and spin, but physicists can count their angels and can get it right to the nearest angel in a total of ten billion. Not an angel more, not an angel less. Science may be weird and incomprehensible--more weird and less comprehensible than any theology--but science works. It gets results. It can fly you to Saturn, sling-shotting you around Venus and Jupiter along the way. We may not understand quantum theory--heaven knows I don't--but a theory that predicts to 10 decimal places cannot in any straightforward sense be wrong. Theology not only lacks decimal places, it lacks even the smallest hint of a connection with the real world. This is a monumentally stupid argument to make. In defense of the realization that science will get you the wrong answers sometimes, you defend it by saying that it gets you the right answers? Seriously? That's your move? Krauss and Dawkins must be good buddies, because there's no other reason to leave such an embarrassing specimen of poor logic in your book.So here's how things stand: I'd love to have just talked about the science of the book. That stuff was all very interesting and very cool. I gave the book three stars because of it.But the reality is that all of this nonsensical axe-grinding was really, really annoying. And, more than that, it was really, really poorly done. Krauss's main philosophical points were unambiguously and totally wrong. If the quantum vacuum is a seething, bubbling mass of particles than it's not nothing. That's not some bizarre, unfair, goal-post-moving ploy by spineless philosophers and theologians. That's just common sense. Ugh. There's more, but I think I've covered enough bases. Remind me to avoid anything by the New Atheists from here on out. These guys and the Young Earth Creationists and religious fundamentalists were clearly made for each other. "

âThe universe is far stranger and far richerâmore wondrously strangeâthan our meager human imaginations can anticipateâ¦Until we open our eyes and let nature call the shots, we are bound to wallow in myopia.â
 This book was quite short, but it was packed full of fascinating information. Kraussâs writing is clear and concise, intelligent and yet still very accessible. I also appreciated his sense of humor. I have encountered some of this information before, but a fair amount of it was new to me. While I canât claim to fully understand everything he discussed, for the most part I believe that after reading this book, I do have a firmer grasp on much of it. Iâll summarize the main points of interest below, so I suppose a spoiler warning is in order. Consider yourself warned.The book began with Krauss briefly describing major relevant historical discoveries in the fields of astronomy and physics. He then went on to discuss the geometry of our universe (is the net curvature open, closed, or flat?). He explained that by analyzing the cosmic microwave background radiation, or CMBR, scientists found that a flat universe makes the most sense. He discussed how, in order to account for the amount of âstuffâ needed to make a flat geometry feasible, we must have dark matter and, what I found even more interesting, dark energy. Our flat universe (the expansion of which is actually accelerating due to the amount of dark energy present) has roughly 30% of its energy in matter, and an astonishing 70% of its energy in âemptyâ space! During this discussion, he also touched on virtual particles (ââ¦that electron-positron pairs can spontaneously appear from nothing for a bit before annihilating each other again...â), and how these virtual particles are actually âresponsible for most of your mass, and that of everything that is visible in the universe.â (Side note: hooray for Feynman!) Krauss also pointed out that in our flat universe, the positive energy of motion (dark energy) is exactly cancelled out by the negative energy of gravitational attraction, and so the total average energy tends to zero.Krauss then posited that an inflationary period may explain the homogeneity and flatness of the universe, and may also have frozen otherwise invisible quantum fluctuations so that they then emerged after the inflationary period as the density fluctuations that produced the visible universe. If this is the case, we all would have emerged from what is essentially quantum nothingness. Then there was a chapter which speculated on the âmost plausibleâ future of our universe, which I thought could have been omitted. He also touched lightly on the idea of a multiverse, and the shortcomings of string theory. He finished up with a discussion of 3 different types of ""nothing"" (the laws of physics plus empty space, the laws of physics without any space, and neither the laws of physics nor any space), and attempted to describe ways in which science could explain how âsomethingâ could arise from each form of nothingness without having to rely on divine intervention. While I thought he did a decent job probing into the nature of nothingness and what exactly that could mean from a scientific standpoint, this portion of the book was a bit too conjectural to really grab me.Okay, I realize I may have gone a tad bit overboard in summarizing this thing! However, that is because so much of the material was really fun to think about, and hence fun to share here. Bottom line: the book was a fascinating read, but it tended to get too speculative toward the end. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like a concise, accessible introduction to cosmology."

The degree to which our best science here has advanced in the recent past is reflected by the understanding of the universe that we had just a century ago. At that time, it was thought that the universe was static and consisted of just one galaxy: our own. In the past 100 years, though, Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized how we understand space and time and the physical processes operating at the very largest of scales, while quantum mechanics has revolutionized how we understand these processes at the very smallest of scales. It is the development of these theories in particular that has provided us with our current understanding of the universe.However, the picture of the universe that these theories have furnished us with still leaves us with an apparent problem: What existed before the big bang? Surely something must have existed beforehand, for if nothing existed then something (indeed everything!) came from nothing, which seems absurd. Indeed there are few things more intuitively implausible than that something can come from nothing. In the philosophical community ex nihilo, nihilo fit (from nothing, nothing comes) is appreciated to be a self evident premise, and one of only a handful of postulates that are completely indisputable.The apparent contradiction between the universe beginning at a finite time, and the premise that something cannot come from nothing, has often been used as an argument for the existence of an uncaused cause, or creator (most often understood as God). However, in his new book `A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing' renowned physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss argues that a full understanding of the science that has yielded our current picture of the universe also allows us to see that something can indeed come from nothing. Thus, for Krauss, science can in fact do the work that it is often thought only God could manage. As Krauss puts it (borrowing a line from the physicist Steven Weinberg), science does not make it impossible to believe in God, but it does make it possible to not believe in God (p. 183). In introducing us to the science that allows for the possibility of something coming from nothing, Krauss takes us through the history and evolution of physics and cosmology over the past century, beginning with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in 1916. In the course of this journey we learn about what our best science says about the basic make-up of the universe (including the existence of dark matter and dark energy), as well as what our best science tells us about how the universe (likely) began and where it is (likely) heading in the future.

46,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,4,"As I have finished reading the book on Monday, I have to say it was not as bad as what David Alberts had characterised it on New York Times as âPale, small, silly, and nerdyâ. Similarly, it was not as good and ground-breaking as what Richard Dawkins purported it to be the âOrigin of Species of physicsâ. I would evaluate the importance and relevance of this book somewhere in between these two extremes. The book starts with some background on the history of physics and cosmology in the first three chapters. I particularly liked the part explaining the works of Edwin Hubble and how he came to the conclusion that the universe is not static but expanding. The discussion on the premise of the book âA Universe from nothingâ starts on chapter 4, âMuch Ado about Nothingâ. In this chapter he talks about particles and antiparticles and how particles can appear spontaneously out of nothing as long as they disappear in ever-shorter times. Chapter 5 is dedicated to spelling out the energy of empty space or as it is more commonly known the Dark energy. In chapter 6, he returns to the subject of nothingness. Given the fact that our universe is a âFlat universeâ, he asserts that in such a universe gravity can and will start out with an empty universe- and end up with a filled one. Apparently, the flatness of our universe is the key to the hypothesis that our universe could have sprung out of nothingness. A flat universe is very special indeed, as its total gravitational energy is Zero (Negative gravitational energy cancels out positive energy of matter exactly). Chapter 7, âOur miserable Futureâ talks about the future of our universe. Based on all the current evidence on the rate of inflation, the future that awaits us is dark and cold as we march toward eternal nothingness. But maybe, as my friend Michael Lopresto explained to me yesterday, this future is not dark and gloomy after all, if only we change our mindset about the whole eternal existence being any superior to non-existence. I am not sure.In chapter 9, he returns to his favourite subject, the question of whether there was a creator. According to him, it is not just that a creator is impossible to exist; it is more the case that modern physics renders him/her unnecessary. He also warns us about the danger of asking all too many âwhyâ questions. He views âwhy questionsâ quite pointless as they presuppose some kind of purpose or intentionality. A much more worthwhile attitude he believes is asking the âHow questionsâ instead. And so he rephrases the title of the book: âHow there is something rather than nothingâ. Finally, on chapter 10 he posits, âNothing is unstable.â He also mentions the presence of some parallels between the topic of the book and the nature of life in the universe and its origin. He continues to the next chapter with an analogy to moral philosophy which I found illuminating. To conclude, read it for yourself but don't trust all the fantastical reviews, but make up your own mind. It is a fast read and is thought provoking."
47,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"I already know that there is no god. Further, that it's a waste of energy to think about the existence of one. Discussing religion is akin to feeding the trolls - just stop.I wanted to read this book to learn more about modern physics/ cosmology. But I didn't want to just get the general ideas and impressions of what I was reading about; I wanted to actually *understand* it. And I couldn't. About 1/3 thru I skipped to the epilogue and afterward, which were fine, but, again, irrelevant. Maybe I need to read an actual textbook that takes a reader step-by-step. I know I'm theoretcially smart enough to understand this stuff, but since I haven't studied physics since the '80s I just don't have the background, nor do I have the agility to dive into a book like this without it. I'll seriously consider watching the video that inspired the book, though.Oh, and I do appreciate the diagrams that actually show why the universe is expanding in all directions away from us, *as if* we're at the center."
48,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,2,"As most reviewers have pointed out, this book came to be after the enormous success that a lecture by Krauss had on Youtube on the same subject. I haven't seen it personally, but I must admit that I am inclined to recommend you to see it instead of reading this book. Or listening to it, which is what I did.Now, don't get me wrong, I found the topic very fascinating and, while I think it could've used a better audiobook narrator (it is Krauss in my version), Krauss' writing was quite engaging and accessible. However, the book didn't need to be as long as it was, and I got the gist of it pretty quickly. Especially because in Krauss' exploration of the topic, he decided to go beyond physics to more philosophical meanderings, but his superficial approach of these didn't add much to the argument. In fact, I feel like it might have detracted from its objectiveness. Some of his key concepts, e.g. nothingness and flat universe, I think could've used more explanation. I also don't think he actually answered the main question of ""why"" something emerges from 'nothingness'. I might have missed something, but I'm pretty sure he just said ""because it can"".Besides that, I found some of his remarks... slightly unnerving, let's say. Most likely something very entwined in my personal experience, but for example when he talked about how coincidental acts that are interpreted by some people as having meaning, really don't have any. Namely, someone dreaming of something and that exact thing happens the day after. Paraphrasing here: ""oh, in such an immense span of space and time, anything can happen, so don't take that as some sort of sign"". Hmm, ok? I don't even think that has anything to do with his argument, so that seems kind of a jerk move to me.There are really interesting points of discussion presented in this book, nonetheless, and in its majority I found it enjoyable. Namely, I liked the discussion on dark energy, dark matter and general relativity. But I probably should've just watched the lecture."
49,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20388505-muhamed,3,"Krauss gives a summary of the scientific discoveries of the past century to arrive at the conclusion that something can come out of nothing even though at the end he answers the question 'why is there something rather than nothing' by ""well there won't be for long"". While, I very much enjoyed Krauss's writing and ideas, I think the last chapters weren't convincing enough. For example, what he learnt from his friend Steven Pinker regarding a morality without God, is very debatable. He claims theologians (and philosophers) do not contribute at all to the society yet he takes his notion of morality, ironically, from his philosopher friend. Is that how insignificant discussions of morality to Professor Krauss, that discussing them is a waste of time and as long as a friend assures us about them we can go about our lives discovering new scientific theories? He quotes his hero Feynmann, that the motivation behind his scientific work was to merely ""find out"" about the universe. I remember now how disappointed I felt when I read Feynmann's biography to find out his derive to find out more meant that he would contribute to technologies so harmful to mankind without ever asking if what he is doing is right. While, I have so much respect for the personal and professional character of Professor Krauss, I don't think this book manages to deliver what it promised to do. What it does however, is to give a lot of clarity to the question."

A lot of times I understood what he was saying but not really how he came to that conclusion. There were things that I understood and found interesting and other things I didn't understand and would like to read more about on my own. The afterword by Richard Dawkins did help a good deal, as I think Mr. Krauss, while undeniably intelligent, wasn't always able to explain things to the uneducated person(namely me). The Big Bang Theory was something we went over quick, fast, and in a hurry in my Bible Belt Public School, so the parts about that were particularly interesting for me.It was when we got into Dark Energy and how the universe is inherently flat but not flat in the sense I want to think of that I began to feel this book didn't explain it well enough for me to understand. It's still an interesting read, and I'm glad I read it! I don't really get the whole ""This is Bible Bashing"" complaint I see in a lot of reviews. He lets the science argue for itself, and if you felt personally attacked reading this book, chances are you are more than a bit self conscious about your own beliefs to start with."

I'm trying to understand how exactly our universe came from basically ""nothing"" but this book is just a bunch of science mumbo jumbo about the universe being flat and the BOOMERANG experiment and light and star distances. The second chapter began with (I'm paraphrasing here) now that we've established a beginning, how will the universe end? And I still don't know how the universe began so.... yeah.

52,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62086210-sabbir-saadat,4,Lawrence Krauss is clearly one of the illustrious communicator of science of this time. This is hard science from him- do pick it up only if you have a solid background in theoretical physics. 
53,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,5,"Great read that made me reevaluate my agnostic perspective. One of the easiest argument for divine creation is the existence of anything as opposed to nothing, and the author tackles it from two directions - 1) Using the anthropic principle: something exists because is it didn't, we wouldn't be around to make that observation, and 2) Citing results from research in physics about how it is indeed possible for something (matter-antimatter pairs) to emerge from nothing, and how even space itself can spontaneously inflate. The book was riveting and one of the very few where I want to go back and read it again so I can better contextualize all the studies and arguments the author has put together. Recommended for anyone who has pondered these difficult questions and wants good intellectual stimulation while getting educated."
54,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10519317-alex,3,I only gave this book 3 stars because I felt too stupid to understand about 90% of it. 5 stars worth of interesting material though.
55,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4031665-fungus-gnat,3,"Krauss gives a more-or-less historical tour through the last hundred years of cosmology, from the single-galaxy universe and the steady-state theory through the implications of general relativity, the triumph of the big bang theory, the expanding (and then possibly contracting) universe, through dark matter and ultimately to the wierdnesses of dark energy, the expansion of space itself, the multiverse, and the creation of something out of unstable nothing. To someone like myself whoâs only read bits and pieces on cosmology for the past couple decades, this book is a revelationânot least because itâs actually understandable through most of the story. Given the abstruseness of the concepts as delivered as simply as I suppose Krauss can for my benefit, I have to think that the abstraction of this material from the actual science, which must be expressed in indecipherable mathematics, must have been just a mite difficult.Nonetheless, this is challenging stuff. Krauss has the fortunate habit of repeating what heâs said, often more than once, which is necessary given the mind- and brain-bending phenomena he discusses. Nonetheless, I bet he would be disappointed to know that, despite his best efforts, his careful walks down logic trails and his quirky little diagrams, some of this material is just not comprehensible to me. It left me feeling at times that maybe if I tried poking around in my Scientific American archive, I might find some helpful supplemental narrativeâan odd reaction to a book-length synthesis. Krauss seems to be eminently fair to scientists who have turned out wrong, and to those who now disagree with him. His treatment of string theory, of which he is not fond, is a good example. He does not, however, always acknowledge skeptics. For instance, he devotes quite a bit of space to the multiverse concept, without much of a second thought, but a doubting article in, well, Scientific American about six months ago suggests there is another side to this narrative.Cavils aside, I would consider A Universe from Nothing as an impressive achievement in science popularization (and, thankfully, a concise one, at 60K words). Krauss, though, has another agenda, which he does not execute as well. He continually erects religious and philosophical bogys whom he then easily knocks down. Like Jesus clearing the money-changers from the temple, Krauss clears the mystics from the house of science, which to Krauss is the entire universe. Now, there may indeed be some benefit in laying out the evidence for a materialistic view of the universe when religious shamans maintain that only the existence of God could explain this or that natural phenomenon. But if reasoning to God from the natural world is a fantasy easily punctured, Kraussâs attempt to reason from the natural world to the nonexistence of God is scarcely more credible. Krauss does not explicitly make an argument for atheism, but it is clear when he says that God is not needed to explain X that he has little or no appreciation for a God who permits what is to be. Saying that science can demonstrate why something comes from nothing takes nothing away from that possibility. Krauss would be better off sticking to science; once he gets beyond it, he no longer enlightens.  "
56,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46791595-travis-swart,1,"I read A Universe From Nothing not long after it came out. At the time, I was exploring both sides of the argument for the cause of our universe. It is one physicistâs attempt to explain how the universe could have come into being without a divine creator (e.g. from natural causes). Itâs a prime example of how desperate atheist scientists are to find a natural explanation for the existence of our universe. In this case, heâs literally grasping at strawsâstraw man that is. Kraussâ ultimate point is to show that on the quantum level, matter can pop out of ânothing.â Therefore it might be possible for these fluctuations to have generated the Big Bangâânothing is unstableâ he asserts. In order to demonstrate this, he builds what Iâm calling a reverse strawman argument. First he builds the strawman by redefining what ânothingâ is in order to fit the definition to his own devices. Then he props his theory up with misleading evidence. At several points in the book, he gives examples of particles popping in and out of ânothing.â It is immediately apparent to anyone who paid attention in high school physics and chemistry classes what this ânothingâ really is out of which these particles pop. They are in fact converting back and forth between a state of matter and energy in an electric field! This is the case in each of his examples. Einstein stated this relationship rather simply in his famous equation E=mC2. We know that matter and energy can change forms in different circumstances. So this is nothing more than a sleight of hand game preying on the scientifically ignorantâfor whom he does do a good job of writing the book in laymanâs terms.By the end of the book, his argument relies on two faulty premises in order for this process to have caused the universe. 1) It requires that some kind of electro-magnetic field has to have been in existence from all eternity for these particles to convert from energy to matter. However, we know through Einsteinâs General Relativity that all matter and energy, space and time came into existence at the Big Bangânone of it is eternal. The Second Law of Thermodynamics reinforces this about our universe. If there was no eternal energy field, then the laws of physics which allow for this process to occur couldn't have even functioned. 2)All laws of physics rely on the existence of timeâno time, no natural laws of physics to cause any of this to happen in the first placeâagain, Einstein established this a long time ago. Since time came into existence at the Big Bang, there was no time before it to enable any laws of physics. Physicists such as Steven Hawking have tried to work around this problem with inventive theories involving things like âimaginary time,â but of course, such theories fail in the real world. Other theories have come out since, but ultimately must succumb to this truth.No time = no energy = no functioning laws of physics to bring about what Krauss is describing in this book. The straw man quickly falls apart once the faulty supports are removed. In the end, he only establishes that there is a need for something to be eternal in order for our universe to have an ultimate cause. And we know that nothing in this material universe is eternalâeven electric fields. What options do we have left once we rule out the laws of physics as being the cause for the Big Bang? "
57,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7564683-rene,3,"I am not a scientist by a long shot, but I have long been interested in astrophysics and cosmology. Those scientists who are truly enthusiastic about what they are discovering are infectious, and those that are not only enthusiastic but capable and patient teachers spread the excitement of science far and wide beyond the walls of the NAS.There aren't a lot who are both, and I have always appreciated those busy with complex research who are so excited by what they're doing that they are willing to stop and try to explain it ""to the masses"". I have seen blurbs and excerpts of Dr. Krauss' work before so I bought this book fully expecting to like it.When Dr. Krauss takes the time to explain the processes behind current and past cosmological discoveries, this book is endlessly fascinating and thought provoking, and it leaves you wishing he would have explained more. In a way, it raised more questions than it answered, which is exactly what introductory learning is supposed to do.  Unfortunately, you have to constantly deal with the distraction of his constant pot-shots at theology and a whole side-plot about whether or not this can prove the ability of the Universe to exist without the need for a ""Creator"" that is constantly derailing the main narrative. It is frustrating, unnecessary, often pointless, and distracting. Several times he makes the point that science isn't theology and theology isn't science. He acknowledges that proving or disproving the existence of God isn't a scientific question. Therefore, I wish he would have listened to himself and resisted the temptation to add his own theological musings. I found myself impatiently skimming over these parts, trying to find my way back to scientific narrative he had suddenly dropped to indulge in these thoughts. Perhaps that is the real point of the book, but that was not the reason I wanted to read it.Astrophysicist Dr. Alex Filippenko, while he has not written an equivalent general publication book, is equivalently knowledgeable, an excellent teacher, and willing to leave theology out of his lectures, and I'd find some of his work if you're interested in general cosmology and astrophysics without the side of religious politics. There are definitely gems of knowledge and discovery in this book and Dr. Krauss' wry sense of irony and humor is infectious, therefore I'd still say it is worth a read so long as you can either sweep aside the annoyance of having to skip through all the pointless theology deductions and/or desire to read those in addition to the science of ""something from nothing"""
58,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"This is a difficult book. Krauss starts with a description of the universe as we now understand it. Describing the history of cosmology in the few pages he has available is an ambitious task. There are many difficult and non-intuitive concepts involved, and while recent reading enabled me to feel familiar with some of these, I was left short on a few areas (e.g inflation, string theory and flat universes). Since this book is written as an argument for a certain viewpoint, the need to take certain 'facts' on face value felt unsatisfying. The ironically unique, or special, place in space and time we humans have to observe all this is well illustrated. Regardless of ones view on other conclusions he makes, I suspect most would agree that our special place is fairly awe-inspiring.The second half then elaborates on the possibility that the Big Bang event could feasibly have had its origin in nothing. At this point, many of the points become more philosophical, since we don't have physical evidence for what did happen, unlike many of the points made in the first half. There are two main lines of argument here, the first being that what we do know suggests nothing may have the potential, or reality the capability, for something to come of it, whilst the second line tends to be that physically based arguments, even if unprovable, are better than theological ones (since they don't assume 'something' to begin with). Whereas the first half required some background reading to understand the concepts, the second requires a leap of faith (or for some a leap off one onto another perhaps). While non-theists would no doubt accept the arguments easily enough, and theists, like me, find them uncomfortable, the existence of anything if nothing was the starting point must be a difficult jump for anyone.The conclusion, regarding the theological discussion, is that of 'soft' atheism: science does not make belief in God impossible, but it does make disbelief possible; without science everything is miracle, with science perhaps nothing is. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end the scientific content had become mixed with the philosophical, and it was hard for me to untangle these details. Others may have more luck than I did, but I'm not sure this one has nailed its goal."
59,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"""A Universe From Nothing, Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing"" is the first book I read by Lawrence Krauss. It dares to explain big question which only theologians and philosopher tentatively had [sort of] answers. It starts with particles soup in the Big Bang to the first star and other modern cosmological aspects.I admit this book is a bit beyond my comprehensible knowledge of cosmology, but I didn't read it with nothing to remember. I could push through to know a bit of history of modern since after Copernicus and what was behind Einstein's general theory of relativity. The book also indicates that we humans, especially astronomers, are living in a very special time right now since the traces of magnificently cosmological events such as the Big Bang, the picture of the infant Universe etc., haven't been erased yet; beings in the next billions or trillions years won't be as lucky as we.Moreover, some questions which are considered to be the intersection of science and religion are also answered. As the book puts it, sometimes, people point out that science just another kind of faith, but it is not. Scientists change their minds, admit they are wrong, and are happy and eager to throw out ideas that turn out not to work. They donât presume to know for certain the answers to questions before they ask them. So yes, they have faith that the universe is comprehensible, but the greatest thing about science is that their faith is shakable. At any moment they can give up believing in anything they once believed in, if nature suggests otherwise.Science, as physicist Steven Weinberg has emphasized, does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant.I may return to this book once I'm more knowledgeable at cosmology so that everything in this book would be more comprehensible for me."
