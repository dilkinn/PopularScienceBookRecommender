1,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader,3,"The title of James Hamblin’s book is a little misleading. It isn’t an overview of the human body that imagines what key organs would say about their functions and advise you to do in order to keep them healthy (if they could talk). It is a sort of medical miscellany in six sections, each of which answers a series of questions. Some questions are about how parts of our bodies look or work. Other questions are about topical issues (for example, about tattoos & tattoo removal or the emerging specialized field of transgender health.) Still other questions concern more curious medical conditions or procedures--such as rare “orphan” diseases like epidermolysis bullosa or Rasmussen’s encephalitis.A few years ago, Hamblin, a trained M.D., left a radiology residency for a career in medical journalism. He is the editor of the health section of The Atlantic's digital magazine and, as such, he is committed to increasing public health literacy in an age of “alternative facts.” Early in his book, Hamblin acknowledges the work of Stanford University professor, Robert Proctor, whose academic interest—believe it or not—is the history of ignorance. According to Proctor, ignorance is actively cultivated through marketing and rumour. Consider the tobacco industry, whose members were well aware (even in the 1960s) of the science linking smoking and cancer, but nonetheless proceeded to make claims to the public that there were “experts on both sides of the debate.” Now, powerful agencies have a multiplicity of media vehicles to spread lies, hence the need for encouraging a critical stance.Hamblin provides brief answers to approximately a dozen questions about the body or medical procedures in each of the sections of his book. Some answers are as short as a couple of sentences; others are a couple of pages. There are also line drawings and other graphics to assist the reader. Topics range from skin (the average person has six pounds of it), dimples, and phases of eyelash and hair growth, to more serious matters, such as kidney cancer and heart arrhythmias. Hamblin varies his tone with the topic. Sometimes he’s matter-of-fact; other times, bemused or sardonic. Apparently aware of fractured attention spans, not only does the author keep his explanations brief, but he also includes some sexy bits to spice things up (e.g. a comparison of male and female genitalia and a bizarre, but increasingly popular kind of plastic surgery: labiaplasty, likely influenced by the prevalence of internet pornography).All of this is well and good, by turns informative or entertaining. However, Hamblin goes further. He encourages readers to look more critically at the practices they engage in, erroneously believing they're doing something good for themselves--like consuming dietary supplements which have not been submitted to any rigorous testing and are churned out by a largely unregulated industry. He also casts a critical eye on the modern funeral industry, particularly the practice of pumping a dead body full of a known carcinogen, formaldehyde, only to place that body in an expensive padded box, which will then be buried and eventually release dangerous contaminants into the soil and water. Playfully or pointedly, he includes plans and a diagram, supplied to him by a North Carolina handyman, for building a coffin for under 200 dollars.Hamblin urges his readers to exercise healthy skepticism towards media. He refers to TV hospital dramas, which give viewers misleading ideas about medicine or medical procedures. For example, the hit television show E.R. depicted CPR saving lives at about four times the rate it actually does in real life. Furthermore, TV patients who experience the procedure (upon cardiac arrest) seldom walk out of the hospital with any degree of brain damage. In actual fact, however, only 2 to 16 % of people who receive CPR from a stranger will live, and the majority of them will endure some form of neurological impairment.I believe Hamblin’s most important observations, cleverly inserted between the lighter tidbits, concern the state of healthcare in America today. How is it, he asks, that the U.S.A. can spend more money than any other country on healthcare, but rank 43rd in the world for life expectancy? The fact is: there are huge inequalities in access to healthcare (and even to certain procedures by region). Some of them are related to socio-economic status; others, to the amount of melanin (dark pigment) in human skin. Hamblin doesn’t shy away from noting the role naked greed plays in healthcare either. He notes that there’s no money in preventative medicine. Hospitals, insurance companies, and doctors themselves gain from illness. But patients are part of the problem, too. They prefer a quick fix, a procedure, over taking responsibility for their bodies and their diets.If Our Bodies Talk is a lively read whose segmented format lends itself to being dipped into at spare moments. I hope it will gain wide readership.Rating: 3.5"
2,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This book is nonfiction science. Now I'll admit, I did not excel at science in school, except biology. I had a great teacher for that, so that made a huge difference in liking the subject and doing well at it. But if all science teachers across the nation could be like the author of this book, kids everywhere would love the subject of SCIENCE. He was laugh out loud funny. I was rolling with laughter at work, which is a no-no (all fun is frowned upon at work). What fun. I enjoyed his approach to the body and its functions. He didn't speak over my head. He told this in a way that all could understand and not once did he come across as a 'know it all'. I really enjoyed it....it spoke to my inner school geek."
3,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40319862-andrea-fluty,5,Loved reading this book! Really interesting and informative but funny. It made me want to search his articles in The Atlantic. 
4,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Early in this I thought that I would be reading a series of question-and-answer trivia on assorted health topics, arranged in sidebar-like sections similar to what one would find in a popular-health magazine. It turned out that Hamblin had something more ambitious in mind and before I was midway I was impressed with the scope and depth of his coverage. I appreciated his social agenda and critique of the American medical system and insurance industry. And it was just entertaining, too. I tore through most of this yesterday and although I wanted to take a breather to absorb it, I could not stop reading (just one more question, okay just one more . . . ). I happened to be sitting in a hospital waiting room of all places, accompanying a friend, and perhaps the healthcare setting was involved, and I was a bit of a captive audience - but I was surrounded by other reading options of ubiquitous Rodale Magazine empire variety and I still chose to stick with this. I can't recall any nonfiction I've read recently more in need of an index than this - because Hamblin's question-headings do little to reveal all his subjects. E.g, how is anyone going to know that (for example) the Watts Riots and institutional racism are discussed under the question of ""Can I get taller?"" or that transgender health/politics and Johnson's War on Poverty are discussed under the question of ""pheromones""?! He rambles into unexpected territory and his transitions are a little strange and almost non sequiturs, but I almost never felt talked down to - with only a few exceptions he didn't seem to be dumbing down beyond what an educated reader who is not a medical professional would be interested in knowing, which I would contrast with The Telomere Effect by Blackburn and Epel, which has received praise from many esteemed thinkers but that I thought was padded with patronizing explanations and misplaced self-help advice."

If you haven't...do! Hamblin explores every facet of the human condition, what we actually know about it, what companies pretend to know to sell us stuff, and how we should think about our bodies and our health. It's a quick but meaningful read, well worth picking up."
6,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body by James Hamblin“If Our Bodies Could Talk” is a fun and educational pop-science book on how our bodies work. Science writer, web personality and senior editor at the Atlantic magazine, James Hamblin, takes readers on an enjoyable journey of the human body. This entertaining 400-page book includes many questions and answers broken out by the following six categories of body use are: 1. Appearing, 2. Perceiving, 3. Eating, 4. Drinking, 5. Relating, and 6. Enduring. Positives: 1.	Enjoyable, inquisitive, well-written science book suited for the masses.2.	The fascinating topic of how our bodies work.3.	The tone of this book is fun. The author makes use of questions and answers in an illustrative, childlike-curiosity manner to drive the narrative. 4.	It’s a reason-based book. It defends the best of our current knowledge. “So this book is a practical approach to understanding our bodies, predicated on the idea that memorizing facts is less important than developing insight.”5.	It does a very good of defining terms so it can be used as a quick reference. “Health in a way at once obvious and radical: “A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”6.	The book is full of interesting facts that complement the interesting narrative. “The average person has about six pounds of skin.”7.	The book is accessible to all levels but there are some unintended philosophical gold nuggets. “Max Factor’s approach is a textbook example of the sales tactic that is still so successful in selling body-improving products: convince people that there is a deficit in some concrete way, and then sell the antidote.” Bonus, “We can’t always choose our mirrors, but we can choose the kind of mirrors we will be—a kind of mirror, or a malevolent mirror, or anything in between.”8.	This book is anything but boring, you are bound to find amusing tidbits. “Tattoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Bonus, “Blue-eyed women three hundred years ago were considered witches and burned at the stake.”9.	Historical tidbits as well. “Among the dire conditions that led to the 1965 riots was lack of access to health care. It has become a common refrain in public health that a person’s zip code is a better predictor of their health than their genetic code.”10.	The science behind itching. “What we know is itch is not simply neuropathic, it’s not simply immunologic, and it’s not simply in the epithelial barrier, but probably a combination of all these.”11.	All those childlike questions, you asked and wondered but never followed up to answer why. “Why do stomachs rumble? The only way they could temporarily silence the borborygmi, they discovered, was by pressing on her left hypochondrium—the upper abdomen just below the ribs (hypo = below, chondrium = cartilage). This, incidentally, is where the term hypochondria comes from, as it was once believed that worry arose in the abdomen.”12.	The truth about vitamins. “Unlike smoking less or exercising more, forgoing multivitamins is a health recommendation that involves no effort.”13.	An interesting look at gluten. “It happened when we believed that cholera was spread through the air, and when we believed beriberi was caused by a toxin in rice, and it seems to be happening now with gluten.”14.	Important topics like conflict of interest as it pertains to our health. “Conflicts of interest exist whenever enormous industries stand to gain by finding evidence in support of their product.”15.	Do you need eight glasses of water a day? Find out.16.	Discoveries that have changed the world of medicine. “Crane’s discovery of the sodium-glucose transport pump, a tiny gateway into the cells of our guts, revolutionized hydration. A 1978 editorial in The Lancet would call this “potentially the most important medical advance this century.””17.	Hot-button topics like sex and gender issues. “One percent of the world’s population is estimated to be not male or female but intersex.”18.	A look at gene therapy. 19.	Heart disease. “The solutions to prevent it are before us, but instead we have created a system predicated on treating the condition—shocking and burning people’s hearts to temporarily restore normalcy, at great cost and risk, most often without addressing the fundamental causes.”20.	Notes and bibliography included.Negatives:1.	This book is very basic; it’s intended for the masses so don’t expect scientific depth.2.	I would have included a chapter on fake science, homeopathy, comes to mind.3.	I would have added more tables and graphs to complement the excellent material.In summary, this book is a treat to read; it educates while piquing our curiosity throughout. Hamblin does a wonderful job of selecting wide and diverse topics regarding our human bodies and provides useful information. It lacks scientific depth and I would have dedicated a chapter on pseudoscience (he does debunk fake science here and there). The book deserves five starts because it is practical and fun to read. I highly recommend it!

7,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18265830-uninvited,4,"The title of this book is a bit misleading, in a sense that it suggests it's something like a guide on what to do depending on the signals (""talk"") the body provides. It's not. It's rather a book of general, current (and that's key) knowledge about one's body and system. As the author puts it in the epilogue: ""...this guide to operating and maintaining a human body is no guide in any prescriptive sense. It’s rather about maximizing autonomy, guiding only in a fundamental way: to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions.""And it was very informative, and, above all, helped put things in perspective and unlearn common knowledge that's either obsolete (the ""current"" key-word I mentioned earlier) or unsubstantiated. Especially regarding ""knowledge"" that we acquire from pop culture or commercials - e.g the gluten-craze. Very interesting and fun to read overall (with a couple of strong laugh-out-loud moments), albeit getting slightly boring in a couple of places - or maybe it was just me not being very interested in a particular subject."
8,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2169863-thaydra,3," I started off really enjoying this book. However, the more I read it, the more I saw how condescending the author seemed to be towards anyone who had opinions other than his own, even other scientists. He appears completely unwilling to even entertain the idea that something could be true unless it has extensive scientific research. So- if something is not tested, according to him it can't be true, and therefore is fodder for ridicule. He also has a way of taking a question and talking around it, instead of truly answering it.Because of the way he talked of others, and his close-mindedness (which, in my opinion, someone who delves with science and discovery should be much more open minded and willing to try) I found myself going from being excited about the book, to more and more disappointed and a little disgusted. I gave three stars because the content was interesting, and his humor was good and did have me laughing out loud a couple of times. If he could just reign in the ego a bit, it would be a great book!"
9,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1438768-xq,4,"I already had a giant, mostly-intellectual, crush on James Hamblin going into reading this from following his work in The Atlantic, so my views might be a bit biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great conversational explanations of health issues where you learn new things and everything is explained simply, but you're not falling asleep like you would if this were a textbook. The illustrations liven up the book too. Super non-fiction read!"
10,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2873282-georg,4,"As so often in life, the most interesting bits happen towards the end."
11,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2850117-debra-slonek,5,"Many folks take better care of their cell phones, cars and computers than their own bodies. Perhaps it is because they have never read or studied an owner's manual. Well, this book is a good place to start!It is filled with intriguing questions which are answered with the knowledge of experts, anecdotal illustrations, and observations filled with wit and humor.Learn about itching and scratching, vaccines and antibiotics, diets and supplements, sleep requirements and dehydration, cancer and heart disease and so much more.Common old wives tales and popular, Internet-fueled myths about human health are dispelled. Good, helpful and scientifically backed advice and facts are shared.A worthwhile read! I received a copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway."
12,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2678080-jenn,4,"This fascinating book is basically a collection of questions and answers about human bodies, which could be really dry and encyclopedia-like. But the questions are things like: If I don't have dimples, could I give them to myself? (Enter bizarre world of elective cosmetic surgery.) Am I tall enough? What is itch? Can I ""boost"" my immune system? Colonoscopy: This is the best we can do? Why do males have nipples? How dangerous are tight pants? If I lost my nose could science rebuild one for me? What happens to my body when I die? Even the questions that I didn't think sounded all that interesting were totally absorbing. I'll definitely be following this author and looking forward to more of his writing. "
13,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48461871-case-chun,5,"Hamblin takes a personal narrative to address the topics in this book to make it less of a lecture and more of a conversation (much like his previous works and articles). He highlights important social and political implications beyond the science of the topics, prompting an important and much needed discussion on the idea of autonomy, access to healthcare, human rights, etc. That and he further advances the public engagement and awareness of science, which also is important. "
14,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16065109-donna-luu,2,"I get the feeling that the questions are not ones asked by patients, but rather created for the purpose of allowing the author to talk about favorite subjects. Clearly, he's against fad diets like gluten-free, but many times he rambles and doesn't have a point. "

16,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404546-meg,0,Vacation reads #7Pop-science. Loved the author's humour most of the time. Interesting answers to various body-linked questions. Not an actual guide.
17,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65154349-jite,2,"2.5 Stars...I think this started off interesting. I wouldn’t say I’m the hugest fan of pop science books but I came across this and was intrigued enough by the Q&A format and the idea of our bodies “talking” that I decided I wanted to read this. To start with, I have a public health and have worked in international public health for the past 10 or so years. I think this book is definitely written for the American context and makes some assumptions that aren’t necessarily fact about the rest of the world.My primary issue with this book is the author’s condescending tone. What at first begins as sharp, dry wit at best but more truthfully is really sharp sarcasm soon becomes open condescension for the people asking the questions, for the public made up of untrained medical experts who of course don’t know everything, for other scientists and doctors whose views aren’t in line with him. And I like wit and I like humour but when you’re the omniscient one and the joke is never on you, when there’s not even a pretense of acknowledgement that your answer may not be the write one particularly when a lot of answers really ARE “agnotologistic” “research results are mixed...” type answers, when all of those things fill the book, it becomes a little pompous and unbearable to read. The author is particularly harsh on people he doesn’t agree with and almost comically impressed by any doctor with an Ivy League CV. The author is very comfortable making clear that doctors and scientists don’t have the answers in a way that is kind of condescending (as they they should have the answers if not for economic or cultural factors which he is so much above) but also very quick in detaching himself from responsibility for not having the answer.My second issue with this book is some of the questions. I call BS that some of these questions are asked by the average person. I feel like many of the questions were written to suit the script or narrative for that chapter. Or if they were genuine questions, they stemmed from high level discussions with his peers. I feel like a real opportunity to answer pressing questions that real people, non-doctors actually have was eschewed to instead present cutting edge research or medical anomalies that most people would be otherwise unaware of. And that’s fine, but this is presented as a Q&A answering honest to goodness real questions about the body. I found that there were many answers I wasn’t interested in just because the questions were so contrived and uninterestingly set up. Some of the answers were pretty technical and unnecessary in completely not answering the question or only being borderline relevant. It felt like some of the interviews and stories were forced to fit into the box of the questions. It definitely wasn’t flowing anecdotal support of an answer. I feel like the eating and drinking parts especially were missed opportunities because there are lots of real questions around that.My third issue with the book was the clear (environmental) agenda the author was pushing. The agenda was not necessarily wrong or something I’m in disagreement with, but I think this book pushed that very hard and in a way that wasn’t necessarily compatible with medical fact. In certain arguments, you could see that the author had definitely picked a side and was aggressively pushing that rather than giving the overview of the science that you would expect. But then again, it is only to be expected since this a “doctor answers” sort of book. He will obviously be influenced by his view on the world- vegan, there’s a population explosion, the world won’t be able to cope. Somewhere the idea of one child per couple is floated. But when you consider that the greatest, most exponential population growth is happening in the global south, then the messenger becomes a little awkward and not because the facts are wrong but the way it’s all presented.I liked that the author pushed certain issues like race and inequality and even transgender issues but I was often left completely baffled by the placement of these issues and the casualness with which they were treated. If you’re going to bring them up and you have the space of a book, I think they deserve a “so what” in addition to a “by the way.” This is a very critical sort of book. The last chapter about death made me particularly uncomfortable because I don’t think it took enough into account people’s cultural and emotional connections around death. It was very dismissive of how Americans and even other cultures and religions view death and very flippant about something that is deep for a lot of people. And I get that the flippant tone was intentional to destigmatize death but it also felt very tone deaf and very reliant on one source without actually considering any other sides. So no, I ended up not liking this though it started well."
18,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/850609-brooke-waite,4,"This book surprised me. I'm not sure what I was expecting....maybe a question/answer format or a section focusing on different parts of our bodies and their functions. Not so. Not really at all. What I got was more of a social commentary through a health/healthcare lens. Hamblin explains this in the epilogue that the ""stories, are in most cases less straightforward as answers than might seem ideal."" I didn't expect to be reading about transgender health care, poverty and the Watts riots in South Central. Also gender roles and the ethics of how to dispose of our bodies when we die. It did make his answers far more interesting though.Hamblin went through medical school and started a residency only to discover that he had more questions seemingly, than answers. So naturally he ended up becoming a journalist, instead of a doctor.He poses questions such as, ""Why don't tattoos wear off?"" or ""Can I get a more defined jaw by chewing gum?"" He often uses stories to answer his questions and the answers range from a few sentences to a few pages and are often hilarious, in a snarky way. He also addresses certain myths and conundrums in health that we've just come to accept such as carrots giving us better eyesight, sports drinks actually balancing our bodies electrolytes, individual bags of flavored oatmeal being healthy and why the word 'moist' can trigger visceral reactions in many people!I did get a sense that he's quite skeptical of naturopathic or 'alternative' medicine, gluten 'sensitivity' (the quotes are his) and the vitamin/supplement industry. I could understand that as a classically trained medical physician but then his discussion of our gut microbiome and how it's so adversely affected by our overuse (and downright abuse) of antibiotics in ourselves and in the food we consume that I understood he's simply trying to find answers the same way that we are. He's just trying to frame them in a way that will challenge our ingrained notions on what is and isn't healthy. Thank goodness for journalists. Although it wasn't what I was expecting, (I guess) it was enlightening and enjoyable.And at least now I know that if I lose a contact lens in my eye, it won't get into my brain!"
19,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7716365-kate,4,"It took me ages to read this book, but that's not because I wasn't into it - it just sort of lends itself to being picked up and put down by virtue of its layout. I loved all the little snippets of information and the humour in Hamblin's writing, but also that this book about facts behind human anatomy and function also included the political. Here are two of my favourite quotes from the book, the first about how tobacco companies are evil, and the second on how female sexual health deserves more study and respect.""The classic example of purposeful ignorance is that created by the tobacco industry. Ever since tobacco was clearly proven to cause lung cancer in the 1960's, the industry has attempted to cultivate doubt in science itself. It cannot refute the facts of cigarettes, so it turned the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known? The strategy was brilliant. Proctor calls out 'alternative causation,' or simply, 'experts disagree.' Tobacco companies didn't have to disprove the fact that smoking causes cancer; all they had to do was imply that there are 'experts' on 'both sides' of a 'debate' on the subject. And then righteously say that everyone is entitled to their belief. The tactic was so effective that it bought the industry decades to profit while reasonable people were uncertain if cigarettes caused cancer.""""...Pfizer publically abandoned the idea of marketing Viagra to women in 2004 because, as the New York Times put it, women 'are a lot more complicated than men.' Filling their organs with blood does not solve the problem of low libido, which is much more common than it is in men. This problem is much more complex than a simple lack of blood flow, and to overlook its causes in favor of simply diverting blood to the genitals would be dangerous. To that end, the truest 'female Viagra' is cultural prioritization of female sexual health, and that won't come in a pill."
20,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3927423-hamza,5,"As anyone else who has worked through this book will tell you - it is not what you expect, going by the cover alone. I wish a book existed that was really ""A Guide To Operating and Maintaining a Human Body"", but this is not that book. Hamblin readily admits this himself, in the penultimate paragraph of the Epilogue (took him long enough right?).But none of the above is a problem - in fact, this book is all the more engaging for the lack of conclusive answers that it has about the questions posed. It is structured like an FAQ, if an FAQ were put in a book and topically split into six chapters. While Hamblin maintains a casual manner of narration (with a healthy dose of his brand of humour injected throughout), he typically does not force absolute answers to questions, but provides the evidence while guiding you towards an answers that are reasonable (or often enough, when there is no answer, to many more questions).I enjoyed the final chapter of this book (titled The Dying Parts) the most. If you haven't been doing so in the first five chapters already, Hamblin does a good job of forcing you to pause, put down the book and think. It is a departure from the fairly light mood of the rest of the book. Part of it is a personal health wake-up call; an effective one since it is framed in terms of death. Some parts are a little depressing (particularly surrounding topics of health span, lifespan, and population). Hamblin's ultimate goal from this book is not to give you all the answers (although he does an admirable job of it) - it is to make you more medically (and generally) curious. In my opinion, by the closing of the book, he achieves it.If you couldn't tell thus far, I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it, as long as you go in knowing that this is certainly not a complete manual on the human body (which, I think, was a lure by Hamblin all along)."
21,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62239960-lara,4,"Like many reviewers, I thought this would be a doctor answering common medical questions with fun answers. Instead, with humour and great writing, this book is a doctor addressing issues he finds interesting in thematically related subsections. What I found interesting was the integration of political critique with medical knowledge. Hamblin dives deep into how money has crippled the medical system from changing recommendations on what we eat to the funding of profitable medical devices. While none of that was new to me, there was a lot to be learned about human psychology. From our connection between vitamin C to curing colds (since it cured scurvy, it can probably cure this!) to the complicated psycophysiological relationships between our bodies and us. I would recommend this book to anyone who shops on GOOP or any other pseudoscience purveyor. "
22,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45364364-kelvin,4,"James Hamblin is honestly quite a figure; an MD halfway through residency who decided practicing wasn't for him and that his future lied in journalism who has taken the scientific expertise learned from years of schooling and translated it into readable medical explanations. This book is both a collection of responses to questions he has gotten over the years as part of his web video series and a stitching together of stories. It's infused with the caring tone and thorough enough explanations you would want from a doctor but also with a touch of snideness that serves to keep the reader on their feet. Perhaps the title is a bit off, this really isn't an expose of the body's various parts but instead medically intriguing stories that illustrate key points to staying healthy (hint: there's no simple formula). Interesting and disturbing as some of the stories may be, they don't merely reveal cornerstones of human health but also lay down Hamblin's critiques about modern healthcare and his advice to think carefully about all of your actions. The book is informative, engaging, and approachable to the scientifically minded reader and the ones who are not alike. And rather than being a hodge podge of trivia in a never ending list of questions, Hamblin actually tells stories making this book a wonderful experience to read."
23,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,4,"Pretty good book. IT took a little bit to adjust to the odd structure of the book, seemingly random questions related to the body. I was surprised that Hamblin took a much broader scope than I had imagined. Rather than just being a book about facts and neat things here we have a popular science introduction to the human body with ethical analyses that the reader likely had not considered or realized existed. The impact that we collectively have in how we use our body is immense. The word use here can mean what we feed it, how we decide to treat it when it is sick, how we have sex with it (and presumably with other persons bodies, I hope), and how we manage its disposal after death. In all of these aspects the body and it's maintenance is fascinating at every turn and is always fraught with consequence. The audio narration worked fine (it was read by the author). I do think a professional narrator might have been a better choice. But that is just me. "

Hamblin doesn’t shy away from talking about how broken our healthcare and medical systems are and how care is often profits driven (the story that sticks with me on this one is oral hydration versus saline IVs). He also approaches his topics and the public’s general state of misinformation kindly and deploys well-placed humor to break up what might otherwise be monotonous. I enjoyed listening to this book, and took away a great deal from it (do not just blindly take multivitamins: look at what you need specifically because you can accidentally poison yourself), and was able to look at topics more broadly than I had before (our food production is literally breaking the planet).

The type of questions you'd be asking would be very much of the type that Hamblin addresses in his book. His tone doesn't come off as condescending, but there is a smidge of medical babble, which he balances with modern-day witticism and some speculation as to not leave a non-medically-minded person in the dust. Or overly fixated on their bellybutton."

It is refreshing to hear a physician acknowledge that clinical science is mostly meaningless without a relatable vehicle to communicate its significance and impact. Additionally, he has a lot of fun proposing thoughtful and socially conscious questions, encouraging skepticism, and promoting one’s health autonomy. The world could do with more savvy and comedic medical translators like Dr. Hamblin. "

43,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
44,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
45,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

48,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
49,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
51,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "

He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
53,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
54,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
55,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
56,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
57,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
58,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it.

73,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
74,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
75,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
79,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
81,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
82,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
83,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
84,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
85,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
86,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
87,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
88,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

103,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
104,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
105,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

108,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
109,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
111,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
112,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
113,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
114,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
115,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
116,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
117,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
118,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

133,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
134,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
135,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

138,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
139,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
141,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
142,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
143,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
144,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
145,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
146,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."

So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
148,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

James Hamblin created a book that was about how our bodies work but all the beliefs that people thought, and completely roasted ideas that just seemed to impossible. He talked about myths about the body, disease, and how our nation is trying to help communities with health problems. "
151,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55684038-ania,2,Unfortunately pretty far away from being a guide to operating anything...nevertheless is this book written in a very funny and easy-to-read style and the facts about the human body are very interesting 
152,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2174508-monica-willyard-moen,3,"Funny, fascinating, and thought-provoking by turns. I like the open, direct, sometimes playful approach of this book. It doesn't sound stodgy like many books about how the body works. I take my hat off to the author."

163,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
164,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
165,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

168,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
169,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"
170,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"What is Cancer? Is smoking really bad for you? How many multivitamins should I take per day? Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
171,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
172,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
173,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."

In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
175,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
176,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."

So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "

He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it.

193,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
194,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
195,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "

I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
201,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
202,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
203,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
204,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
205,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
206,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
207,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
208,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

How much sleep do I actually need?), Three. Eating: The Sustaining Parts (Why do I crave terrible food late at night? Do probiotics work?), Four.

223,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
224,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
225,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

228,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
229,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
231,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
232,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
233,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
234,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
235,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
236,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
237,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
238,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

253,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
254,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
255,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

258,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
259,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"

Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
261,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
262,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
263,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
264,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
265,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
266,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."
267,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3012219-ryan,4,"I'm a James Hamblin fan, so it's not surprise I enjoyed this. So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "
268,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam,4,"I wasn't familiar with James Hamblin before I won an advance reader copy of this book. He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it.

282,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11613722-alex,5,One of the most informative books that I've read in a long time. Very interesting and a good start to get more informed about different aspects of our bodies.
283,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I think I added If Our Bodies Could Talk to my to-read list after reading a decent review of it somewhere. But when I picked up a copy of the book from the library and flipped through it, I groaned inwardly. The book is organized as answers to a series of questions. Questions like “Why don’t tattoos wear off?” and “What are sunburns?” One of those books. Still, I decided to give the book a chance.It’s a decent read overall and not just because I generally find these facts about the human body fun. There are moments in the book when Hamblin uses these seemingly simplistic questions as a jumping point for social commentary. This elevates the book from an Interesting Factoids 101 book (say, like Why Do Men Have Nipples). The prologue hints as this when Hamblin makes mention of agnotology, or the study of ignorance. Hamblin explains that purposeful ignorance can arise when certain actors like the tobacco industry see in in their interest to cultivate doubt, if not ignorance. If they cannot “refute the facts of cigarettes”, they can at least “turn the public opinion against knowledge. Can anything really be known?” We see this played out in other areas like vaccination, food, etc. So books like If Our Bodies Could Talk are presumably an attempt to educate the masses, to make us wary of attempts to cultivate ignorance in us, by educating us on the basic fundamentals of how our bodies work and what might help them flourish or flounder. A question on whether we could boost our immune systems led to a highly educational critique of the supplement industry. Hamblin explains that the so-called vitamins are a group of 13 diverse chemicals “united by no common structure or function, only by the general notion that we cannot live without them. So Vitamin C or ascorbic acid (which comes from antiscorbutic or anti-scurvy) was discovered for its scurvy preventing properties. Vitamin A was discovered to prevent night blindness. And in the case of Vitamin B, that it could prevent beriberi. (Hence Polish chemist Casimir Funk termed this new compound, thiamine pyrophosphate, a vit-amine as it was an amine that was “vital” and life-giving). But Hamblin cautions that there is strong evidence that for most people, even those who “eat even somewhat reasonable food”, multivitamin supplements have no positive impact. Indeed, the risks of over-consuming vitamin supplements are not trivial. (At least in the case of Vitamin C, any excess amounts we might consume are excreted out. But excessive levels of Vitamin A can give your skin a yellow hue and in the case of young infants, increase the pressure inside their heads.) So really, we should be avoiding multivitamins in the interest of health. On the current craze for being “gluten free”, Hamblin notes that it is a “case study in effective marketing and mob mentality”, where people have concluded that the fact that gluten is problematic for a small minority of people (about 1 percent of people are known to have celiac disease) must mean that there are health benefits to be gleaned if the rest of us avoid gluten too. Gluten “has become, in a psychological inverse to that applied to vitamins, subject to the same kind of monotonic absolutism and extremism. A compound is bad for people in one (very clear, limited) context, so it must be bad in many contexts.” It’s the same with the probiotic craze. Probiotics have been shown to have promising impact in very specific contexts e.g. obesity and irritable bowl syndrome. But the industry has disingenuously sold up probiotics as having broader health benefits for everyone. Unlike drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, which must be tested to ensure that they produce the results they claim to be able to, supplements like vitamins and probiotics are hardly regulated. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the result of heavy lobbying by industry, does not require supplements to be tested for quality, safety or effectiveness before going to market. Hence we are bombarded by all sorts of wild claims, which suggest that taking these products can enhance our well-being in some way. Like how taking Bulletproof Coffee can “Supercharge Your Body. Upgrade Your Brain”. In addition, the DSHEA expanded the definition of “supplements” to include not only vitamins, but also enzymes, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, “glandulars” and organ tissues. Pretty much everything it seems. Meanwhile, a question on nutrition – whether we needed dairy to maintain bone health – led to a critique of the industrial agricultural complex. Hamblin clarifies that dairy isn’t the only way we can get calcium in our diet and there are many other rich sources of calcium such as broccoli, spinach, etc. That dairy is important is more reflective of the food system we have created, i.e. a system that has heavily subsidized the dairy industry. Hamblin reports that every 5 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services convenes a panel of experts to review all nutrition research. In 2015, the panel’s report on the optimal health-promoting diet mentioned whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes with scant mention of dairy. However, the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans – issued by the US Department of Agriculture, whose “primary interest…is the prosperity of the country’s agricultural economy” – did not accept many of the new recommendation and indeed chastised the secretary of health and human services for choosing a team of scientists that they deemed to have an agenda opposite to milk. So the federal guidelines still recommend that all adults consume three cups of dairy daily. That commercial interests sometimes trump the public health interest came up again in the discussion on salt. (Side note: I didn’t realize that Morton Salt came from an enormous table of salt in Ohio that an entrepreneur, EJ Young, hit upon when prospecting for oil in 1897, and that Morton is a primary supplier of salt that goes into saline.) Saline is used to hydrate individuals who are dehydrated. For people facing dehydration, just giving them water isn’t enough. You need sodium and glucose as well. Oral rehydration is much cheaper than IV rehydration. In poor countries and in disaster zones, it is the gold standard. Yet, in American hospitals, doctors almost always prescribe IV hydration because if you come to the emergency room with dehydration and the doctor just you a drink, he can’t bill you for it. But with IV hydration, the people who make the fluid make money, as do the people who make the needles, those who make the tubes, the hospitals and the physicians. It’s a no-brainer from a commercial standpoint.The social commentary doesn’t always work. The segue, for instance, from how we get sunburns to how “melanin still consistently underlies social divides of the sort that create and perpetuate more health problems than any textbook disease process” and the discussion of race riots in Los Angeles came across as forced and awkward. Or seguing from the differences between male and female nipples to gender politics. Still, Hamblin’s a decent writer who scatters his book with sharp, sometimes witty, observations. Like when explaining why tattoos don’t wear off, Hamblin notes that the globs of dye are too large for our white blood cells to clear. They just cannot beat the dye and our immune system eventually “resign themselves to living with these dermal intruders. [So t]attoos are about defiance and individuality, but also resignation.” Or that some of our health obsessions are more a reflection of privilege than anything else. Like the addition of fluoride to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. It was first tested amongst schoolchildren in 1948 in Grand Rapids, Michigan but the study was terminated early because the effect was so clearly beneficial, it would have been unethical to withhold fluoride from the control group. Today, “losing a child to tooth decay is a scarce concern in wealth countries, [so] certain parents now worry about fluoride. People of privilege and prosperity can spend their time worrying about the more obscure elements of exposure”. An educational and entertaining read, all in all. "
284,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62796824-erin-bomboy,3,"I enjoy James Hamblin's columns for The Atlantic, which is why I read this. If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body is an entertaining although longwinded (for real, all the chapters could have been cut by 25% with little lost) guide to what you already suspected: We are both too clean and kind of dirty. The former can be chalked up to excessive showering (an act that exacerbates eczema) and spending a staggering amount of money on potions and powders that do little to help and, often, might hurt. As for the former, Hamblin would like you to scrub the embarrassment off the word anus. In short, dry toilet paper does little to degunk your crack of excrement, which is why washing your hands after dropping a deuce is critical. In lieu of a bidet (did you catch what I did there?), moisten your TP before swabbing your aft deck. "
285,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24460839-muriel,5,"This book strikes a fine balance for reading during social-distancing: A) serious enough to confront the failing of commercial interest, media, healthcare, and society; B) James Hamblin also put in efforts at humor to make it light rather than stern ( “Rous Sarcoma virus (a study in psychology, naming a cancer-causing virus after oneself)” lol). I liked the audiobook enough to listen twice. •	Commercial interests, purposefully manufacture ignorance and spread liesFor money, countless industries sow doubt to long-held scientific consensus by claiming “experts on both sides of the debate”. Tobacco industry is the prime example in sowing doubt that smoking caused lung cancer. Worse, since it cannot disprove the facts, tobacco industry turned against knowledge/science itself: can anything really be known? Then proceed to claim everyone is entitled to their belief. Sounds familiar? That success of course spawned subsequent science-deniers (always commercial interests) to imitate similar smokescreens for vaccination, climate science, nutrition, etc. I appreciate Hamblin introducing research by Robert Proctor, whose academic pursuits include ‘History of Ignorance’. Highly relevant for our time, where information bubbles make it easier to “silo yourself into a tunnel of ignorance”.•	 MediaIf claims are too outlandish to sustain, industries just pay for new ads to insinuate that their products are better than proven medical practice. (Vitamin-water ad: “flu shots are so last year”.) Besides crafting paid-for subtle claims to influence people’s purchase, media empires are commercial interest themselves, of course they mine our psychological responses and write the most clickable story out of their volition – spreading triviality/irrelevancy if not purposeful lies (unless someone pays).•	Healthcare Preventive care does not generate revenue, so no one pays much attention to the research that exercise and dietary choices could reduce cardiovascular disease. But, feeding people fast food, cardiology and heart surgery – will generate revenue for agriculture and healthcare industries, so there is a world leader in both fronts. Medical education does not touch affordable and effective remedies, as a result, many doctors are not even aware of these alternatives. For example, oral hydration could be just as effective in treating dehydration as IV saline solutions, it doesn’t involve complicated instruments, products, or specialized practices, and costs much less. Unfortunately, I see this third bullet failing in healthcare feeds into the ‘gold age of ignorance’. If the healthcare industry does not pay attention to cheap preventive care, nor aware of affordable and effective remedies, for their own commercial interests, you could see a little niche why people would click on baits touting pseudo-science home-remedies “so effective but doctors don’t know”.•	SocietySociety differentially treats people based on genders, skin-pigments, zip codes, etc. – and conditions people to behave differently treating their own body parts – patients for some elective procedures are predominantly one class not the other, the pool of patients chasing one technical trend this decade then another ‘natural’ trend the next. Not just living people, society also forms expectation for what kind of coffins or treatments are more “dignified” for the departed, and argue corpses suffer if relatives do not follow funeral industry (expensed) prescriptions. Society manufactures desires for us, much of which are unnecessary. Then of course, these desires/anxieties are manufactured out of commercial interest, not out of thin air. Society is a rather loose umbrella propagating these manufactured desires, often shrouding the true origin and making it the ‘norm’. Minor peeve: --Aiming at humor, or perhaps to catch the fractured attention of readers, this book spends time on what reads like trivia (tattoo, eyelash), which do not have the same impact on life quality as, cardiac arrest. This is only a minor issue because, the book thankfully account for this by grouping topics into Appearing – Perceiving – Eating – Drinking – Relating – Enduring (The Dying Parts). The final chapter includes weighty discussion such as what is life form, what could be our species's future. Even in the first chapter, “Appearing: The Superficial Parts”, you could get thoughtful discussions on what is normal or beautiful – from beauty as signals for ‘reproductive health’ – to ‘the looking-glass self’ that we understand ourselves not from empirical idea/data, but from how others react to us – to Hamblin’s self-mirror, understanding we could serve as mirrors, make the choice to be a kind mirror. I like the last bit Hamblin invented, it’s already a strange world where even our understanding of scientific research is swayed by paid contents, let’s pretend that we still have this little bit of agency and autonomy, by choosing to be a kind mirror."

288,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13232003-zoey,4,"Fascinating and often witty mini-essays on topics ranging from nutrition to sleep to cancer. These are well-written pieces that sometimes flow into one another and other times change topic entirely. Very entertaining and informative, and (of course) much better than Googling one’s health questions! :) If there were a downside, it would be that Hamlin tends to quote extensively from 1-3 experts on a given topic, letting these voices speak authoritatively on the subject. This only becomes problematic if a particular expert does not deserve to speak alone on the matter, and I can’t determine that. At times, Hamlin can be a bit heavy-handed with his own opinion as well. However, that’s his prerogative, and fits with the way this book came out of a video series he did for the Atlantic. Questions are being posed to him, after all! Aside from health info, there were fascinating discussions of trends in American society, from the rise of supplements and “gluten-free” diets to the elevation of “agnotology,” the cultivation of ignorance. The 2020 context of political polarization, social media, and a global pandemic make for some prescient moments in this text. "
289,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,4,"Why Do I Drool When I Nap And Not When I Sleep?Yes, this book really does answer that question--and many others as well. I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a zany, fun read. The book is organized into distinct questions, such as, ""Can I stop wearing my glasses if I eat enough carrots?"" (Of course, the answer is, ""No."") For each question, the author provides a page or so (sometimes much more) of simple facts, research, and then a summary. For the ""glasses"" question, the author points out that you can ""Take all the vitamin A you want, drink all the carrot juice at the club, and it still won’t help your vision.""The author writes in a fun, easygoing fashion. He explains his curiosity in biological curiosities led him to medical school, where he expected ""to come away with some sort of mastery of how we work, and I ended up with only more questions."" I found it fun to bounce around from topic to topic. I started at the Table of Contents, which lists all the questions, and then just skipped to ones that sounded fun. Some of the questions are pretty silly, such as ""What if my tongue ring came out and I accidentally swallowed it?"" (Answer: Probably nothing, but could lead to perforation.) Other topics are more practical questions, such as, ""How much sleep do I actually need?"" (Answer: 7 hours.) For many topics, the author cites recent studies or research. For the sleep question, we hear about a Finnish 2015 study of over 10,000 people, which found ""the optimal sleep duration that correlated with the fewest sick days (absence from work) was 7.63 hours for women and 7.76 hours for men.""One of the more funnier topics was, ""Why do I drool when I nap and not when I sleep?"" Of course, I didn't need the answer for MYSELF, but I read the answer just in case a FRIEND needed to know.I admit I had never pondered many of these ideas (such as what would happen if I swallowed a septum ring.) Nevertheless, the author provides a new perspective. On the subject of colonoscopies, for instance, he wonders, ""This is the best we can do?"" Well, I confess I never wondered if a colonoscopy was really that great a thing. But it takes sound primitive, the way the author puts it: ""It is customary for all people over a certain age to periodically have a camera on a mechanized tube as long as a person is tall inserted into them to detect and remove irregularities."" Seeing it that way, I admit--yes it does seem peculiar. I hope that advances are forthcoming. All in all, I found IF OUR BODIES COULD TALK to be a fun, relaxing read. I read the book in the spirit in which it is intended--i.e., fun and entertaining. I confess, however, I am still pondering the last question, ""What happens to my cloud data when I die?"" That one is keeping me up nights. Is the data backed up somehow? Advance Review Copy courtesy of the publisher.For more views like this, see: https://www.bassocantor.com"
290,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"What is Cancer? Is smoking really bad for you? How many multivitamins should I take per day? Does Vitamin C actually prevent Colds and the Flu? What is a vaccine and how does it work? Why do we tan?Let’s face it, our bodies are complicated. How is anyone meant to keep up with all of the garbage being printed about such things as supplements and methods to grow taller? Well, look no further than this book! With If Our Bodies Could Talk, James Hamblin has found an easy way to confer answers upon those of us without medical knowledge.Apparently, the man has a blog or a podcast, but I am not certain of that. Hamblin covers the whole of the body, though. From ruminating on whether or not a contact lens can find itself lodged in your brain (nope) to questions on how tattoos are dissolved by lasers (the laser breaks up the globs of ink into a size your body can excrete) you can find the answers here.The book runs as a conversation. Someone has a question, and that question is answered. It gets a bit more complicated than that, however, when the question turns in a rambling meandering path. Sometimes it is difficult to tell where Hamblin is headed, but he always manages to find the answer in the end. The human body runs the gamut from the hilarious to the slightly macabre and Hamblin is not afraid to dive right in.The book is divided into six main sections. The human body is considered an organism, which is interesting considering how most anatomy textbooks are organized. Most doctors are some sort of specialist. You have separate doctors that you see for your shoulder, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. While this glut of information may not be particularly bad, it is somewhat disconcerting. It just goes to show how much there really is to know. For example, around 8 percent of your DNA is viral; that is to say, it is from a virus. The same thing goes for your body’s cells; most of the cells in your body are bacteria and other such things. You wouldn’t be alive for long if a genie suddenly got rid of all of that.Along with the text are entertaining little pictures and cartoons that show the structure of skin for example, or a graph that displays sleep cycles. This makes the book more charming by comparison to something that would not have that, and by extension, more accessible as well. I would recommend this book if you have ever had any questions about your body and wanted to ask some guy who went through medical school and left to become a journalist. That isn't to say that the book is bad though."
291,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50912414-jacob-starr,3,"Initially, I was super excited to read this book due to the high praise that it had received from those around me; however, once I dove into the actual book, I felt unimpressed by a number of things. The first thing that I didn’t like was how unprofessional the author acted towards his interviewees. He often focused on how they looked and often made odd remarks about the race of the interviewee that left me confused. For example, the author always made sure to mention if someone was a white male before degrading their works and opinions which leads me to a second point: The author had an evident political agenda throughout the book. One notable chapter began with the seemingly simple question, “What are sunburns?” However, after promptly answering the question, the author began a five page rant about how racism is rampant in America and policies that have contributed to racism. Don’t get me wrong, I love hearing different political viewpoints and care about social policies but they don’t really belong in a book that is supposed to talk about science and is placed under a misleading question. In fact, the book often seemed disorganized and I felt betrayed by how often the author misled the reader.There was good material in this book too though. To my relief, the book included several answers to odd and quirky questions that I have always wondered, but have never gotten a direct answer to. Additionally, despite my initial reaction to how often the author tried to throw in politics to science, I learned a lot of new things that definitely changed my outlook on how I view prescriptions and medications. The theme of how consumerism and business affect medicine was especially enlightening. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this to someone purely for the sake of science, but because of the interesting topics that are brought up in the book relating to politics and the world of medicine. "
292,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"4.5 stars, actually.Hamblin, a journalist who started off as a doctor, takes us on a rambling journey through many (not comprehensive but definitely timely) questions a layperson might have about their body such as ""why don't tattoos wear off"", ""how do vaccines work?"", and ""i need dairy or else my bones will break?""Hamblin definitely has an irreverent sense of humor, as well a definite pro-science, anti-unregulated supplements, pro-vaccine stance. He does his best to present facts, important researchers, and experimental results in an objective way, but his humor and leanings shine through.There is little surprising in this book, although you will walk away with a deeper grounding in the science behind why your body works the way it does, as well as a healthy skepticism for unregulated supplement and ""vitamin"" claims on being able to slow or heal aging. For breaking open the hype on supplements alone, the final third of the book is valuable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the opening chapters about Agnotology: the study of our own ignorance. He gives an example of how the cigarette industry twists narratives to portray developing science for its own commercial use: ""The industry knew that third of all cancers were caused by cigarettes, so they mad these campaigns that would say experts are always blaming something-- brussel sprouts, sex, pollution."" He highlights how cognitively exhausting it is to constantly filter the scientific misinformation and marketing based ""facts"" about our bodies ""coming at each of us daily"" more than entire generations in the past.Science is real, folks. And even books like this, written skillfully and transparently for non-scientists (and in the process losing a bit of depth and scientific nerdy credit) are important for people to read to keep their truth filters in place."
293,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17090434-marta,1,"Ok, this is another one of these books when you’re not sure if the author himself is dumb or he takes his readers for such and for that matter sprinkles everything with irony and not funny dad jokes. This is a book that asks great questions. Too bad hardly any of them get answered without “funny” stories and anecdotes that have almost nothing to do with the question itself. It goes like: “why does this happen to my body?” “Wow, it’s a great question indeed! If only I knew I wouldn’t have decided to study medicine, ha ha! Let me tell you a story of a woman who also wondered that and ended up having a surgery with no need at all! (Here come 10 pages of the story)Hilarious, isn’t it? I’ve presented this topic in many symposiums alongside mr X from university X, mister Y from university Y, and so in with 10 other people! So, all in all, you just have to get used to the fact that it happens, but hey, don’t mention it out loud when getting to know the parents of your better half!” Also, the book is very very very American. Loaded with American facts, American jokes and American references, so there’s a good chance you (like me) won’t find it funny where it’s supposed to be simply because you’re not immersed in American culture. I expected it to be much more neutral, like the topic it covers. So if you’re into this kind of “science” books then good luck, cos this one is pretty thick."
294,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98631154-sadie-wilson,4,"I really enjoyed this book. (It’s hard to believe I just wrote that about a nonfiction science book). In If Our Bodies Could Talk, Hamblin uses a conversational style to address common modern questions/misconceptions/trends relating to the human body. It’s a helpful review of many things I did know (eat plants, exercise, sleep) and many more things that I did not (about immune systems, cancer, stem cells etc.) The main takeaway from this book is that you should approach your own body maintenance with common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism towards supplement trends and sensational articles. "
295,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148119-christina-gagliano,5,"I checked this book out of the library as research for a book I'm working on, planning to just read the chapter relevant to that project. I ended up reading this book cover to cover because it was so well-written (with just the right touch of humor), so informative, and so thoroughly met the author's goal: ""to encourage questioning of the cultural and commercial messages all around us, challenging normalcy, and remaining skeptical of simplistic solutions."" Among all of the wonderful insights into physical health and how our perceptions of our own health are so heavily informed by marketing and health insurance companies, the part of the book that made the most impact was metaphysical and tied in with Sean Carroll's book The Big Picture that I read earlier this year: pages 331-332:""Robert Proctor, the professor of agnotology (aside: the study of ignorance--I love it) at Stanford, put it to me more delicately: 'It's easy to exaggerate our importance in the universe.' Proctor likes to ask his students why they fear death and yet they don't fear the time before they were born. 'There's a perfect temporal symmetry there--but no one fears the year 1215,' as he put it. Though it would be terrifying to live in 1215, his point is that we don't inherently fear a world without ourselves in it. What we fear is the world going on without us."""
296,0385540973,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074239-sophia-chung,4,"This book answers all kinds of questions about health and the human body. I discovered James Hamblin through his video series for The Atlantic many years ago and have been a huge fan of his content for The Atlantic (as well as his Twitter feed!) ever since. He did not disappoint with this book, which is informative and well-researched from a scientific standpoint and absolutely brilliant from a comedic standpoint. I am currently a student in a health profession, and this book provides a review of many important health topics such as atrial fibrillation, gut microbiota, sudden cardiac arrest, etc. However, Hamblin’s simplified explanations can also be easily understood by anyone not in the health professions. Along with some topics one would learn in a clinical classroom, Hamblin also covers useful topics that I didn’t know that I didn’t know. For example, he sheds light on the data and evidence available for certain nutrition fads, reveals myths marketed by certain industries, and throws in loads of entertaining “fun facts.”I especially liked how he tied everything together in a beautifully philosophical way at the end, leaving the reader with memorable themes to take away. Hamblin is a one-of-a-kind, hilarious and intelligent author, and I will definitely read future books that he writes."

So many cool bits about the human body.Here are a few of my favorite excerpts:The average person in the US eats 1,996 pounds of food each year. What we eat may be the most consequential decision we make in our lives not just in terms of our health but collectively in terms of the global economy and the environment. The idea of thinking about food as made up of only carbohydrate, fat, and protein is akin to saying the solar system is composed of only planets and a sun. That a bubble of fear is growing around gluten is a case study in marketing and mob mentality, and a testament to how badly we want to be healthy. Consuming the probiotic products on the market right now is like reaching into a bag labeled 'assorted seedlings' and taking a handful and throwing them into a forest. Some of them might not even be seedlings. If some of them do grow, will they be good for the forest? Having 8 billion people eat a meat-centric diet is impossible.At what point is the work of treating disease and extending lives actually unwittingly precipitating the end of human kind. "

He's an md and editor who writes for the Atlantic magazine and has made a series of videos. Hamblin's magazine and video background shows in If Our Bodies Could Talk, which is more like a collection of articles, or blog posts, than a cohesive, linear book. There are themes that keep reappearing -- the public's gullibility, the dishonesty of commercial wellness businesses, the perverse incentives of the medical profession, etc. -- but these subjects aren't grouped together; instead the book is unhelpfully structured around questions and answers about various aspects of the human body. Still, if it reads like a collection of blog posts, they're excellent blog posts: informative and surprisingly funny, and I learned that TV's Mister Rogers was a wonderful human being.Some readers may be disgusted or depressed by the descriptions of body failure; I did skip past some of it. Really, when you look at how complicated they are it seems miraculous that bodies work at all."

It answers questions I have - or wish I'd thought of. Arranged in parts like this: One. Appearing: the Superficial Parts (What makes hair curl?), Two. Perceiving: The Feeling Parts (What is itch? How much sleep do I actually need?), Three. Eating: The Sustaining Parts (Why do I crave terrible food late at night? Do probiotics work?), Four. Drinking: The Hydrating Parts (Do I need eight glasses of water a day? Why do so many peopled of dehydration?), Five. Relating: The Sex Parts (How dangerous are tight pants?), Six: Enduring: The Dying Parts (Why are more and more people dying of heart disease?). He's funny, without making fun of the question or the reader. I look forward to his next book. Meanwhile, I'm enjoying listening to his discussions on the podcast Social Distance and his weekly column in The Atlantic ""Paging Dr Hamblin.""Plus, the illustrations by Hallie Bateman are so helpful!"
