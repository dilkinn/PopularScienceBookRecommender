Wilson is frank about his disdain for philosophy, a literary genre I enjoy, and it seemed to me that he might be one of those brash scientists who writes off everything that isn't science as old-fashioned nonsense. I suppose that characterization isn't entirely unfair; but Wilson has thought about it a lot and makes the case in a nuanced and interesting way. At the very least, he presents a useful target for the philosopher who wants to defend his subject from the attacks of reductionism and scientism. Refute Wilson, and you'll find most of the other guys easy.""Reductionism"" is often presented as a bad thing, but Wilson spends a large part of the book arguing that when correctly used it isn't just good, it's indispensible. A distinguished biologist born in 1929, he watched from the front row as quantum mechanics reduced chemistry to physics, then as DNA reduced biology to chemistry. He knows the details and is well aware of the problems involved. Of course each level of structure is hard to describe usefully in terms of the one below. Of course the higher level always presents emergent phenomena that hardly even seem to make sense at the lower level (you don't discuss software bugs in terms of the motion of electrons). But at the same time, the coherence - or, as he likes to say, consilience - of the different levels adds enormous power. It may at first seem out of the question to think about the behavior of living creatures as a chemical process. But once you've invested the necessary person-millennia of work and sequenced the human genome, it no longer comes across as ridiculous. There are pieces of DNA, that create proteins, that have effects on the body. You can trace all the links and conclude that a specific piece of molecular structure causes a specific disease; then you can design gene therapies to attack that disease.The reductionist program has been stunningly effective in all the hard sciences. Geologists use physics to quantify the mechanisms of plate tectonics, cosmologists to explain the history and structure of the whole universe. Wilson's central claim in this book is that we now have to take the next step and extend it to the soft sciences. Economics, ethical philosophy and literary theory are all products of human thought, and are typically analyzed as depending only on human thought. But human thought depends on the human brain, which belongs to the realm of biology. There must be a bridge which goes from biology, through neuropsychology, to ethics: it must in principle be possible to analyse ethical behavior as a biological phenomenon. Wilson is an expert on ants; he gives detailed examples of how the program works there, and how the behavior of ant society can be broken down into the study of the chemicals individual ants use to communicate with each other. Of course, human society is enormously more complex. But just because the task is very difficult, there's no reason to give up and say it's impossible. In 1916, the reduction of biology to chemistry would have seemed at least as difficult. A century later, DNA splicing is mainstream technology.The most surprising thing about the book is that one expects Wilson's underlying message to be cold and inhuman, but as it approached the final chapters I found the exact opposite was true. Critical decisions in the world are usually made by politicians who have received their training in the humanities, in disciplines that are not grounded in the empirical sciences. They are as a result cut off from the underlying biological reality, from empirical understanding of living creatures as they really are. As Hume pointed out over two centuries ago, conventional ethical reasoning is grounded in abstractions that have only a tenuous connection to the feelings of real people. In the same way, modern economics models human agents in terms of simplistic folk psychology, assumptions about ""rational decision-making"" that have little to do with the way people actually think. There is even less attempt made to model the complex ecosystems in which these humans are embedded. It's not hard to believe that some of the very bad decisions made by politicians and economists are due to the conceptual isolation in which they have placed themselves.I find it difficult to make up my mind about Consilience. There is something naively utopian about it, and I am not sure that it will necessarily be a good thing to continue extending the empirical reductionist program until it reaches the human sciences. Maybe it will help us better see ourselves as part of the world's biosphere and stop destroying it; unfortunately, it seems at least as likely that it will just give the ruling elite more efficient ways to manipulate us. But there's no doubt that the book's worth reading. This should measurably change your view of the big picture."
1,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy,4,"I was shelving in western philosophy the other week (I don't really have a choice against eavesdropping on bookstore conversations, and they're pretty much all inane to the point of inflicting brain atrophy on the listener, i.e. me). As I walked down the aisle with a handful of Wittgenstein, a customer approached. Sure enough he had a lame excuse for a beard, and deliberately mussed-up hair atop his excessively squinty facial constitution; fucking college kids. As I looked down I saw, of all things, a pristine Black Flag sweatshirt (as in, like, not a hoodie). I sigh; one that seems to have echoed in my head for the past month or so as a sort of mechanical reaction to the rich tapestry of assholes and contrived eccentrics that color my retail-working existence. He says that he's looking for a sort-of-general-introduction to philosophy. I don't want to be a complete asshole myself, but I hate this sort of question. I'm not really big on giving book recommendations in general, only because I've had nothing but miserable experiences with customers and the act of offering my own intellectual honesty regarding what they should read. So, I tell him that they would be shelved in philosophy anthologies. Of course, he attempts to sound somewhat snarky - the part which basically makes no sense to me - telling me that he is looking for an introduction. I sigh again, explaining why that would be shelved in anthologies. Then I make a passive attempt to placate him by recommending Bertrand Russel's History of Western Philosophy in the most sincere way possible, explaining that it's really funny and informative. Anyway, that's what I read, back when I gave a shit. Now he's changing his story though because he proceeds to ask me if there is any political philosophy in it. I feel inclined to say yes, and explain how and why, but my brain is seriously upset at this point and I just point him in the direction of general politics in the next aisle. He disappointedly intones, ""OK thanks"". I'm happy to clean my hands of the entire interaction though. I ask myself, ""Who the fuck wears a Black Flag sweatshirt anyway, Neal Pollack?"".My days are full of interactions like this. It's not annoying that he was asking for help, and because I'm too hep to want to help a clueless tool like that. It's because, about eight years from now, that kid will probably be polluting a lecture hall with a bunch of made up bullshit about dialectical materialism and Gramscian hegemony. He'll do it effortlessly too because he isn't very bright, but he's confusing an artistic temperament with a desire to exercise serious critical thinking in order to solve incredibly ornate social issues, so he'll probably do just fine in the philosophy department. I'm assuming all of this because, as I mentioned, I was eavesdropping, and I was hearing a lot of not-so-confidently stated gibberish about Heidegger's methodology of phenomenology and something supposedly profound that his professor said about it. In other words, his professor said something profound about Heidegger basically saying something profound about perception that Heidegger stole from Husserl, or some bullshit. And believe me folks, it's bullshit. It just sounds profound, but profundity should never really cost that much. Most academic profundity is a complicated version of a street proverb dipped in gold. Fucking Black Flag sweatshirt? I'm making sweeping generalizations about continental philosophy here. Feel free to call me out, but I've no delusions about what I'm doing. In fact, I feel entitled to make them because I can empirically explain some popular motives for getting into seriously complicated philosophical doctrines. I suffered from this same desire to alienate and condescend every person I came across, even if I knew for a fact that they were considerably smarter than myself. Reading philosophy, more specifically philosophy in the convoluted tradition of Kant, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, etc, is sort of a notoriously popular shortcut to sounding intelligent. Not only is a majority of philosophy concerned with mental abstractions, metaphysical paradox, and unsolvable ethical dilemmas, which sounds like enough of a waste of time. There is also no way of scientifically testing a majority of the theoretical propositions that most heavy philosophy puts forth. Add to that, the fact that a lot of it - most specifically the tradition that I'm attacking here - is couched in such a dense, made-up vernacular, that the interpretations of ""what so and so really said"" are basically as endless as that of what Jackson Pollock's paintings were really trying to say. This should all seem fairly obvious, but I've come across far too many mentalities that are as serious about some of these ideas as some people are about the law of gravity. It just doesn't add up.It does, however, sound appealing if you fashion yourself an intellectual, but have a bad memory and even poorer critical thinking skills. When I started working at the ole' bookstore, I was more than ready to become this self-styled, autodidactic intellectual. I wanted to be a leftist, spouting everything I knew about Lukacs that he knew about Marx. I attempted to pontificate on Kant's categorical imperative, on Derrida's notion of difference, and Nietzsche's call for philosophers to philosophize with a hammer. I thought I came close to understanding Zizek. Shit, I thought that had come such a long way from digging Plato's cave allegory. I thought that all of these ideas and tidbits of information were practical and useful knowledge that I would eventually be payed to write about. I alienated people, I talked about James Joyce a lot. I drank too much, and slept surrounded by partially read books. I also felt terribly scatterbrained half of the time, and luckily I never came across anyone (such as my older self, or any other reasonable intellect) who was willing to wittily put me in my place. So, anyway, the thing about pontificating about Kant or Zizek is that even if someone is familiar with half of the esoteric phrases that you are randomly connecting and explaining, they couldn't logically criticize you for articulating shameless intellectual fallacies because their opposing take on it, at best, is really just a difference of opinion. Mathematical algorithms on the other hand, are pretty much set in stone. The table of elements; not much room for improvisation. You can't argue what the labor value of any given human organ is, or if one species of canine is socially oppressed by the other. Neuronal signaling is not an abstract mechanism in the big impressionist painting of the phenomenology of perception. The biologist E.O. Wilson is concerned with how seriously people tend to take some of this stuff. The focal point of his polemic, in terms of philosophy (a huge part of the social sciences), is the postmodern or poststructural variety and its intentional attempt to cause intellectual anarchy by proposing ideas such as science being a social construct, all knowledge being impossible, and some pretty over the top theoretical propositions about moral and cultural relativism. In the first chapter on the Enlightenment, Wilson discusses his dream of intellectual unity, and makes mention of his rule of thumb concerning philosophy and the social sciences, ""To the extent that philosophical positions both confuse and close doors to further inquiry, they are likely to be wrong."" Here are a few snippets on both Derrida and Foucault.On Derrida:""Nor is it certain from Derrida's ornately obscurantist prose that he himself knows what he means. Some observers think his writing is meant as jeu d'espirit, a kind of joke. His new ""science"" of grammatology is the opposite of science, rendered in fragments with the incoherence of a dream, at once banal and fantastical. It is innocent of the science of mind and language developed elsewhere in the civilized world, rather like the pronouncements of a faith healer unaware of the location of the pancreas. He seems, in the end, to be conscious of this omission, but contents himself with the stance of Rousseau, self-professed enemy of books and writing, whose work Emile he quotes: "" ... the dreams of a bad night are given to us as philosophy. You will say I too am a dreamer; I admit it, but I do what others fail to do, I give my dreams as dreams, and leave the reader to discover whether there is anything in them which may prove useful to those who are awake.""On Foucault:""To Foucault I would say, if I could (and without meaning to sound patronizing), it's not so bad. Once we get over the shock of discovering that the universe was not made with us in mind, all the meaning the brain can master, and all the emotions it can bear, and all the shared adventure we might wish to enjoy, can be found by deciphering the hereditary orderliness that has borne our species through geological time and stamped it with the residues of deep history. Reason will be advanced to new levels, and emotions played in potentially infinite patterns. The true will be sorted from the false, and we will understand one another very well, the more quickly because we are all of the same species and possess biologically similar brains.""I quote Wilson on these two particular philosophers because it elucidates his theoretical project of consilience. Throughout the entire book, Wilson goes through the long list of the academic social sciences, coming up with sound reasons why many of these disciplines truly require a little consistent natural science or basic empirical observation in order to make knowledge more communicable and useful; poststructuralism is many things, but a useful theoretical application it most definitely is not. To sort of paraphrase Wilson's thoughts on the social sciences, what he is basically trying to say is that many of these texts and ideas are kind of intellectually neat, but in the end they really just make for nothing more than very eloquent reading, or possess a purely literary value, including some commentary on subjects such as politics, economics, and social interactions. I've come to feel the same way myself. Maybe it's a sign of aging, but I've have a hard time mustering up the energy to read a really long, dense philosophical text in recent years. I'll often just choose a novel instead because it's a way of reminding myself that this is the reading that I set aside for emotional escapism. These books are for that abstract, romantic, ponderous side of me, that, despite the way this review might make me sound, is definitely still there. In other words, I'm a dreamer, but I don't sleep all of the time.Consilience was a wonderfully enhanced wake up call to many of my thoughts regarding philosophy, the social sciences, and the invariable superiority of the natural sciences. This is just one aspect of this great book, and a big part of Wilson's proposal to create a sort of synthesis of the two academic worlds. It's a lofty one, and also one that is probably neglected by practicing scientists because, as Wilson mentions, they are mainly specialists working in esoteric fields, with far too much work on their hands to dedicate any time to giving such a theoretical project much consideration at all. As for academics working in social science departments, they clearly wouldn't want to be involved because the notion of consilience, in essence, really utilizes a majority of the methods and approaches of the natural sciences to explore more complicated and abstract social concerns, thus eliminating the role that the actual sociologist or philosopher plays at this point. I actually have a few friends (ones who I disagree with a lot) with graduate degrees in social science departments who typically scoff at me when I mention Wilson's name, or the concept of sociobiology. That, in and of itself, is an entirely different Pandora's Box that I'd rather not crack open right now. I've focused on one aspect of this wonderful book, but aside from its central thesis, there is so much practical information on evolution, neuroscience, biology, and basic intellectual history, to be gleaned from it. Not everyone will agree with Wilson; especially the sociologist, anthropologist, political scientist, or philosopher. However, those that are willing to acknowledge the inherent faults of the social sciences while embracing their value as mere earnest reflections on terribly complex social issues with no conceivable answers, will enjoy Consilience as a sort of canonical statement of intellectual honesty spread across several disciplines. None of this is to suggest that philosophy is a waste of time. It can truly be a lot of fun, but there seems to be a large crowd of readers out there who just aren't willing to admit how flawed it can be. That or they're just not curious enough about the natural world to want to read anything other than a bunch of esoteric babbling about the essence of their own being. In other words, life is too short to be a douchebag. I found this out the hard way, though I can say that I do know better than to wear a fucking Black Flag sweatshirt."

If you're someone who has discombobulated on magic mushrooms and grasped, in a sudden terrifying instance, the image of all seemingly disparate islands of knowledge stitched together by an invisible network of mycelium, give it a go.Reading books like: I, Asimov, and: Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman, sparked in me a deep love of polymaths. Those multidisciplinary specimens who lay bare the porous nature of cognitive domains and humble us with their broad erudition. Since that time I've had to grapple with acknowledging the fruits of specialization, while also tipping my hat to the deplorable state of general education.I don't know what the answer is to that tension, and this book doesn't really attempt to provide one, but I think it does a good job of illustrating the arguments in favor of increased collaboration and holistic models of comprehension. It's an important issue. So stop pigeonholing yourself and expand the scope of your existence.Connect with this book!"
3,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"""The central idea of the consilience world view is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics."" This is an obvious truth, and the fact that so many people passionately object to it tells us more about society than science. Some are committed to the numinous, where an ineffable presence guides humankind without reference to the physical processes of life. On a more practical, if not cynical, level many adherents of the soft sciences got there because they could not hack calculus, and are not kindly disposed to Wilson’s argument that their chosen fields of study could be improved with a better grounding in mathematics.The book’s central theme is the relatedness of all knowledge, from physics to psychology. For those who don’t see the connection, consider this:The etiology of culture wends its way torturously from the genes through the brain and senses to learning and social behavior. What we inherit are neurobiological traits that cause us to see the world in a particular way and to learn certain behaviors in preference to other behaviors. The genetically inherited traits are not memes, not units of culture, but rather the propensity to invent and transmit certain kinds of these elements of memory in preference to others.Accepting this idea would add some rigor to the social sciences, which are notoriously squishy in terms of their underlying scientific background. It is easy to see why Wilson’s premise has met with such determined resistance and ridicule from those who have made their careers building ever more complicated theories of mind and society that do not take biology, chemistry, or physics into account. The deconstructionists and postmodernists, in particular, seem to bring nothing to the discussion but clever nihilism, asserting that all knowledge is contingent, all theories nothing but social constructs.Despite the opposition, science continues to move toward Wilson’s vision of consilience. Biology today is incomprehensible without chemistry, and chemistry relies on physics to make sense of its data. Geologists, cosmologists, and many other branches of science are equally dependent on the recognition and acceptance of the fundamental forces at work. As time goes by the realization of this underlying unity may spread to the softer sciences as well. Consider how much ink and blood have been shed over the idea of free will as a metaphysical construct, and then see how Wilson brings it down to earth with a few empirical observations:The hidden preparation of mental activity gives the illusion of free will. We make decisions for reasons we often sense only vaguely, and seldom if ever understand fully. Ignorance of this kind is conceived by the conscious mind as uncertainty to be resolved; hence freedom of choice is ensured. An omniscient mind with total commitment to pure reason and fixed goals would lack free will. Even the gods, who grant that freedom to men and show displeasure when they choose foolishly, avoid assuming such nightmarish power.Another reason that Wilson’s view is gaining ground is simply that the nature of science is changing, from how much you know to how well you can interpret what you know. “Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? The answer is clear: synthesis.”The book was published in 1999, and not all of Wilson’s predictions have come true. In one case, he repeats the now discredited geneticists’ maxim OGOD, One Gene One Disease. Further understanding of the genome has proven that not to be the case at all, which explains why, for all the understanding of genetics that we have gained over the past two decades, we still have a long way to go in identifying the root causes, much less finding cures, for many DNA-based diseases.This is, nevertheless, a brilliant book, a masterful account of how science is moving toward a greater convergence of knowledge and understanding. Those social scientists who continue to reject Wilson’s thesis are whistling in the dark; unless they are prepared to add some science to their studies they will find themselves more and more detached from the kind of deep understanding which is, after all, their reason for being."
4,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60488672-william-liggett,5,"E. O. Wilson is one of my heroes. He is a life-long scientist with the courage to take on the deniers that his writing brings out. This book was the first of his that I came across almost 20 years ago now. What struck me was the breadth of his consideration of the scope of human discovery. His term ""consilience"" was defined as the coming together of all knowledge—the power of drawing insights from many disciplines in a era when science is increasingly compartmentalized. I especially appreciated his retracing the history of the enlightenment and the power of man's intellect. As we struggle with problems to be solved from climate change and the loss of species to political and economic unrest, we need the power of human intellect more than ever. E. O. Wilson models what this looks like."

""The labyrinth of the world is thus a Borgesian maze of almost infinite possibility. We can never map it all, never discover and explain everything. But we can hope to travel through the known parts swiftly, from the specific back to the general, and—in resonance with the human spirit—we can go on tracing pathways forever. We can connect threads into broadening webs of explanation, because we have been given the torch and the ball of thread. There is another defining character of consilience: It is far easier to go background through the branching corridors than to go forward.""""Take the ‘edge of chaos’, one of the most frequently cited paradigms of complexity theory. It starts with the observation in a system containing perfect internal order, such as a crystal, there can be no further change. At the opposite extreme, in a chaotic system such as boiling liquid, there is very little order to change. The system that will evolve the most rapidly must fall between, and more precisely on the edge of chaos, possessing order but with the parts connected loosely enough o be easily altered either singly or in small groups.""""The central idea of the consilience world view is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""""Neuron systems are directed networks, receiving and broadcasting signals. They cross-talk with other complexes to form systems of systems, in places forming a circle, like a snake catching its own tail, to create reverberating circuits. Each neuron is touched by the terminal axon branches of many other neurons, established by a kind of democratic vote whether it is to be active or silent. Using a Morselike code of staccato firing, the cell sends its own message outward to others.""""Mind is a stream of conscious and subconscious experiences. It is at root the coded representation of sensory impressions and the memory and imagination of sensory impressions...Consciousness consists of the parallel processing of vast numbers of such coding networks.

Culture helps to determine which of the prescribing genes survive and multiply from one generation to the next. Successful new genes alter the epigenetic rules of populations.

6,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"E.O. Wilson is one of the few people in the 20th century who can actually claim to have given birth to a movement that did not disappear. His early work in Sociobiology, once roundly rejected by liberal academia, became the nucleus of the stunningly successful discipline of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s and beyond. In Consilience, Wilson sets himself the impossible task of arguing that all human knowledge can be reduced to key scientific principles. This is a somewhat different task than actually articulating those principles, but he gets a pretty good start on what they might look like. And they look a lot like evolutionary psychology.As a humanities professor, I should probably be more offended by Wilson's reductionism than I actually am. Without a doubt, he believes that everything dear to humanists--the universal human love of literature, the drive to find meaning in religion, the desire to construct and understand our own history--can be understood through a competent understanding of biology. I don't agree, but I am intrigued nonetheless. I don't think that Wilson's model explains, or ever can explain everything. But I think that it can and does explain a lot of things, and that is quite a task for a single book.  "
7,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/246177-rob,1,"for me, this was so horrible that after 100 pages i simply could not bring myself to go on. i guess this book was written for congressional staffers to read, and all the flowery language was supposed to ""inspire"" them to tell their boss to give scientists lots and lots of money. basically, i think Wilson knows he is never going to do any good science again, so the next best thing is to write a book about how scientists (i.e. himself) are the angels of humanity. everything is simply asserted, then the reason it's important is because he quotes some old dead guy, then the reason it's true is because he says so, and the reason it's wonderful is because he uses a few four-syllable adjectives to describe it.and maybe the most infuriating thing is that somewhere under all the pompous claptrap, his main point is actually pretty interesting: that science and the humanities, which parted ways centuries ago, did so to their mutual detriment; that there should be a unity to all knowledge; that all types of deep intelligence come from the same mental stuff but the connections have been lost in our time, and that this causes problems in society, academia, business, government, etc. but i hated this book. it doesn't prove a thing. "
8,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I may not have come across this remarkable book unless I read the review written by a fellow Goodreads reader, whose opinion I have come to trust. That, to me, is the greatest utility of Goodreads. Reading in an expensive activity, especially at my age. There are only so many books I can manage to read before my ability to absorb them fades away. Therefore I want to minimize the chance of reading something and then discovering it to be useless. I don’t need to agree with the author, but it is highly desirable that I am transformed in some way between the before and after. This book definitely met that criteria.Transformative non-fictions come in two variety – books that expose some unknown intellectual territory, and books that connect things that were already known in some surprising way. This book falls in the later category. It allowed me to make better sense of my intellectual landscape, and more importantly, it covered all aspects of my curiosity, be it physical and biological sciences, philosophy, social sciences, or the arts. In fact that is the central thesis of the book. Science, as a way of thinking, has surpassed all other modes of thinking in terms of successfully explaining the world around us. No other discipline can claim nearly as much progress in their entire history as much as achieved by science in just a few hundred years. If Plato attends a modern day academic seminar on Philosophy, once he crosses the barrier of language and terminology, should have little difficulty in following what is being said. But no such luck for a scientist from even two hundred years ago. The reason for this lies in the methodology of science. The entire body of scientific knowledge must ultimately agree with each other, no matter from which branch of science. No biological principle can contradict anything in chemistry or physics. If we find a single observation that contradicts a theory in physics then either the observation has to be proved false, or the theory is wrong, no matter how many great scientists may be involved in creating that theory. This rigor is what made science progress at the rate it has progressed.The author wants to bring this same methodology and rigor into the humanities. He admits that the domain of humanities deals with systems and processes that are far more complex than what science deals with, and therefore, achieving similar success will be incredibly more difficult. However, that that is no reason to give up and not even try. Ultimately, all branches of humanities deals with activities of human beings, and as a creature we are bound by the same laws of physical sciences. No matter how we want to view ourselves, we cannot deny our biological self and our evolutionary history. Following this argument the author tries to establish why denying our biological nature is not only inadequate, but can actually lead to neatly self-consistent, but wrong understandings of reality.Even though I agree with his argument, some people may find his dismissive attitude towards conceptual pillars such as Marxism, Post-modernism, and Cultural Relativism a little too harsh. I think Steven Pinker does a more thorough job of dismantling these views in many of his books. Anyone interested in this topic will probably benefit from reading this book along with Pinker’s Better Angels of our Nature, Enlightenment Now, and The Blank Slate."
9,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275136-jeff,4,"With the way things are in academia, nobody in the world could be qualified to write this book. The disciplines are too boldly demarcated, it is often said, each a small nation state prowled about by a tight pride of leonine experts who snap at ignorant layman invaders. But accomplished scientist and human nature theorist E. O. Wilson is a dove among the hawks who perceives a need for increased cooperation among all branches of human knowledge. All of them, which he arranges vertically with particle physics at the base, combining into chemistry, flourishing mysteriously into biology, and then crossing the epistemological event horizon leading into the softer social sciences and even the humanities generously placed at the apex. His point is not, as some critics howl, to make each body of knowledge reducible to the more empirical discipline beneath, but rather to consider an aesthetic vision of human knowledge as unified, coherent from its loftiest theoretical heights to its foundation in the universal laws of nature. The most persuasive chapter, on the fundamental importance of the hard sciences for all successful societies, precedes more adventurous forays where Wilson can not help but flounder among more unfamiliar terrain. Though some opponents may jeer and indicate simplifications as he draws his thread through their expertise, Wilson's contribution is an awkward step towards an ideal of common goals among all inquirers of nature and mind, utopian surely, but at least his work supplies an unreachable point to which we can aspire."
10,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,1,"I've been meaning to read Wilson for a while now, but I regret starting with this. While his wish to unite the various academic disciplines into a single corpus of knowledge seems to come from the right place, his actual efforts to explain what such a system would look like are dull, meager, and at times poorly reasoned. His effort to show linkages between the natural sciences and the humanities in particular falls completely flat. A few paltry examples culled from his own research, while interesting, really don't provide the necessary underpinnings for such a grandiose vision. For a such an ambitious stated intention, I was expecting something much more tightly reasoned with exactingly stated theoretical foundations. Instead he seems to just sort of vaguely point in a direction things might go. I do think he's right when he says that the social science and humanities would probably benefit from a better understanding of things like genetics and Darwinian evolution, I just think that these sorts of cross discipline synthesis need a stronger foundation than the one he provides. In truth, this felt more like a collection of loosely linked essays than a coherent work overall. When he writes about biology and ecological conservation he's very compelling, it's when he tries to venture into other territory that he comes across as inconsistent, clumsy, and just flat."

12,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2043312-sam,2,"I don't agree with the overall thesis, nor do I agree with the way the arguement is made. I am especially skeptical of Wilson's use of history and art - fields of inquiry which he seems to be grossly oversimplifying in the service of his arguement. He may well be as versed in 18th century French history or the contemporary novel as he is in science, but if so this book does not establish it. There are some truly eye-rolling moments in his discussion of the Enlightment and in his two page dismissal of ""post modernism"" - which, think what you will about the subject, is certainly worth more serious treatment than Wilson is able to give it. The sections concerned with science are obviously more interesting and better written and his arguments are clearly more at home in the realm of the quantifiable. Overall, I disagreed but found the book interesting and thought-provoking, at least in certain ways. The argument is so wide-cast that it is a bit difficult to go into it without getting lost in a lot of details. "
13,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,5,"Wilson's point is that there was a time when a single person could know all the formalized knowledge that there was to know. Of course that was a long time ago. Today there is a zillion times more to know, and the problem is that to be an expert, we have to focus on one particular narrow domain. This is necessary, but the problem is that each stovepipe tends to be ignorant of the other stovepipes, and that is a problem.This book, is then an attempt to encourage us to step back, and try to understand the big picture. It would be impossible to unify all knowledge in one book (as the subtitle claims) but if anything he gives us motivation to try and do this. Social scientists should know more about biology. Biologists should know more about ethics. Ethicists (if there are any in America) should know more about Physics. And so on. It is not suitable to isolate yourself in one narrow field.It is an extremely intriguing idea. He then takes us on a romp through a number of different field, to show how they are related and how they should be more involved with each other.In the chapter on natural sciences, he talks about complexity, and how reductionism from the enlightenment is cause of separate domains of knowledge. Science is the practice of reductionism. This is ""why so many accomplished scientists are narrow foolish people, and why so many wise scholars in the field are considered weak scientists."" Wilson, both a wise scholar and an accomplished scientist, did not write this to take a cheap shot at some scientists, but rather to say there is something going on at a level of complexity which can not be seen when you reduce to simple, experimentable problems.In ""Ariadne's Thread"" he touches upon the intersection of mysticism and science. On dreams, and on the relationship between symbols and dangers that our ancestors had to know to avoid without training. Again complexity theory enters to which he gives his own definition as ""... the search for algorithms used in nature that display common features across many levels of organization.""Chapter 6 is on the ""supremely important"" subject of the mind. ""Today, people know more about their automobiles than they do about their own minds."" He touches on consciousness, moods, and free will. ""The hidden preparation of mental activity gives the illusion of free will."" At the same time, not only do we have free will (at out level of organization) but belief in free will is a survival instinct.Chapter 7 ponders the genetic roots of art and culture. Genes prescribe epigenetic rules (regularity of sensory perception and mental processing). Culture forms from this, and also controls which genes survive in a kind of feedback loop. Chapter 8 on Human Nature poses similar questions, followed by chapter 9 on Social Science, and Chapter 10 on Arts and Interpretation. There are patterns that appear only if you consider multiple fields at the same time.Chapter 11 brings us to Ethics and Religion, a chapter worth reading several times. He has built up to this point, and you know there are no simple answers. Then the book is capped off with a summary chapter. There is no question it is an important book. It is not a light read either, but a book that is rich and profound. The goal is audacious: the unify knowledge. No single book can do this, but what he achieves is some compelling examples of how things are more related than we might think. What he motivates, is the idea that true understanding of the real universe will take a non-reductionist view of the big picture in order to see the phenomena that occur only at the aggregate level.And ... it also greatly expanded the list of books I now need to read as a follow up."
14,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73077948-alina-lucia,5,"The main question Wilson tries to address in “Consilience” is the following: What is the relationship between science and the humanities, and how is it important for human welfare? Wilson argues that answering such a question requires that the branches of learning unite, and erase the ill-defined boundaries, arisen from pure ignorance rather than a fundamental difference in mentality. And I could not agree more. To me, both science and the humanities offer different perspectives on the same question; the question of human nature, a topic relevant only because we all have happened to acquire the ‘human condition’, which allowed this introspection in the first place. (Dogs don’t care about human nature, fact which is directly attested to by my husky which is enjoying a great slumber as I write this; in fact, I suspect my husky does not even ponder his own husky condition; naps seem much more important to him).Arguing about which is more important, the sciences or the humanities, is a futile exercise due to its very presumption, namely that an ultimatum must be reached. Reaching such an ultimatum often means that some intellectual compromise must be made along the way, a compromise to which a truly inquisitive mind would not subvert. Even Wilson admits: “[…]absolutism; the dangerous Medusa of science and the humanities alike”. The answer often lies at some point within the spectrum, not at the extremes. Thus, I would imagine that science is the subject of human nature, while the humanities are a projection of it. If one may use the analogy of old movie cassettes, such would follow: The movie itself is encrypted in the cassette tape, while what we experience is the projection of it. Two mutually inclusive events, equally important events, in the whole situation of ‘being at the movies.’ Science and the humanities are two mutually inclusive events, equally important events, in this whole affair of ‘being’. A failure to grasp this view, a kind of lack of cohesion of thought, can only have chaotic effects at the individual level, and then propagate itself to the group level."
15,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,4,"The summer before my freshman year at SMU, the required reading list included C. P. Snow's 1959 tract, The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, which described the gulf separating the humanities and the sciences. When I entered the university in the fall of 1965, the curriculum was integrated in an attempt to bridge that gulf. All students were required to take an ambitious program of arts, sciences, humanities, and mathematics that included required courses for all in ""The Nature of Man,"" ""Twentieth Century Arts, Institutions, and Ideas,"" and two courses in ""The Development of Western Civilization."" Science majors acted in plays, and humanities majors dug up fossils. Wilson's book would have had an honored place in that curriculum. He well may be too sanguine about the possibilities of creating a unified theory of knowledge, but his advocacy of consilience is admirable. If mankind must drown before reaching the shores of understanding, at least Wilson's passionate appeal will have encouraged us to swim in the right direction. The book is dense with ideas and requires more than one reading as well as an exploration of at least some of the references in the excellent notes in order to get the full benefits of Wilson's work. As freshmen, we were charged in the inaugural lecture welcoming the class of 1969 to answer the question posed in the Psalms, ""What is man that thou art mindful of him?"" I strive still to answer that challenge and am deeply grateful to have Edward Wilson as a companion on the quest. "

The book argues for mutual cooperation between biology and other branches of knowledge, as well as for protection of and conservation in the planet. Here's the concluding paragraph:""I believe that in the process of locating new avenues of creative thought, we will also arrive at an existential conservatism. It is worth asking repeatedly: Where are our deepest roots? We are, it seems, Old World, catarrhine primates, brilliant emergent animals, defined genetically by our unique origins, blessed by our newfound biological genius, and secure in our homeland if we wish to make it so. What does it all mean? This is what it all means. To the extent that we depend on prosthetic devices to keep ourselves and the biosphere alive, we will render everything fragile. To the extent that we banish the rest of life, we will impoverish our own species for all time. And if we should surrender our genetic nature to machine-aided ratiocination, and our ethics and art and our very meaning to a habit of careless discursion in the name of progress, imagining ourselves godlike and absolved from our ancient heritage, we will become nothing."""

Every attempt of a human to unify the bodies of knowledge on disposal, is a prove that we, the highest order complexity beings, can't stand the chaos.But, no matter how beautifully devised this book is, and no matter how joyful this read is, I've clearly missed the loud A-HA. I felt like something, like the ""corpus callosum"" not that does not connect, but is to noisy to transfer clear bits. Personally, and it's only a matter of taste, I wish the author kept the same high standard in being a laconic as he did of being magically eloquent. It's very difficult to be eloquently laconic or laconically eloquent, I assume, but I like the laconic way of expression - it's a way of noise reduction in information transfer. If you remember the ""IF"" or the ""with it or on it! :) I'm afraid, despite of the awesome trial, the unification still remains as a ""song of the sirens"", we need more time, more deep understanding of our realm.

Call it ""theory of everything"", or consilience, a word chosen with great care by Edward Wilson. He tries nothing less than proposing to bring not only the sciences but humanities under a single umbrella. The stars given are not a judgement on the writer's erudition and intentions at all, but show my inability (and the lack of enjoyment as a reader) to grasp everything the writer was trying to do here and my lack of interest when it came to physiology, the evolutionary sciences, and some such topics. "
19,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,4,"This is probably my favorite of the books I’ve read by Edward O. Wilson, although it did not alter my worldview as profoundly as On Human Nature did when I read it back in early 2012. Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge is an eloquent explication of the ideas and dispositions I hold in highest regard. It is arguably the most enterprising work of an ambitious career, which makes it both stunning as well as outlandish. Despite my awareness of numerous respectable critiques of Wilson’s propositions and methods, I must confess to being swept away by the sheer grandeur of this vision. Such reverie no doubt dulled my critical faculties, although I will still attempt to outline some areas of disagreement between Wilson and myself.First, however, I will share Wilson’s definition of consilience and provide a brief sampling of the topics he addresses in order to flesh it out. “The central idea of the consilience world view,” Wilson writes, “is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics” (291). It follows that all natural phenomena can ultimately be explained (and perhaps altered) by scientific inquiry. Although I will concede that this idea might eventually be revealed as unverifiable or even outright false, I’ll also cop to participating in a recent discussion with a friend in which we both agreed that it’s hard to communicate clearly with (let alone trust) anyone who doesn’t believe that the universe––at whatever level of chemical, biological, or technological organization––is “dominoes all the way down.”If you can get on board with the cause-and-effect essence of consilience, then this book will be a fun ride through one of humanity’s greatest living brains. Drawing from an interdisciplinary set of sources, Wilson weaves seemingly disparate ideas and observations into one impressive (if not comprehensive) intellectual web. Here are some of my favorites: ––A healthy balance of praise and admonishment directed toward the existing scientific establishment ––A concise and informative summary of the Enlightenment’s historical significance ––An engrossing theory of gene-culture evolution (now deepened by Wilson’s recent work on “multilevel selection”) ––An examination of the problem of subjective experience (qualia) that is more accessible and scientifically informed than that of most philosophers (especially non-contemporary ones) ––A fascinating description of the mental mechanisms that produce dreams ––A careful look at the strengths, limitations, and hubris of modern economics ––A healthy and empirically-driven respect for the humanities and the arts ––A remarkable ability to embrace the difficult reality that humans are stone-age dingbats who’ve nevertheless developed complex societies and technologies that allow us to throw our weight around like little godsWhile Consilience is certainly teeming with information that is accurate and still relevant more than 15 years after original publication, it also contains some inconsistencies and less than brilliant moments. One problem is that, like many other interdisciplinary thinkers, Wilson fails to map out how societies can actively pave the way for the practice of consilient inquiry. He aptly exposes the shortcomings of academic hyper-specialization, but fails to offer a practical model for how individuals are supposed to overcome the suffocating dichotomy faced by curious individuals from all backgrounds: learn everything about one thing or learn a little about everything. Wilson’s assessment is accurate but frustratingly vague: “We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely” (294). It follows that the training of competent “synthesizers” ought to be one of humanity’s major priorities, but Wilson gives no account of the necessary steps we should take to realize this goal. If synthesizers play a key role in bringing consilience about, then we need to know: what are the conditions most conducive to the flourishing of syncretic people and communities? Wilson’s critique of the social sciences is a similar jumble of incomplete insights. He musters a terrific takedown of postmodern relativism, but also downplays the massive and potentially insurmountable obstacles that render complex systems opaque to traditional tools of scientific analysis. I concur with Wilson that the social sciences and arts are theoretically reducible to causative rules, but am more skeptical that we are anywhere close to possessing the knowledge and/or technology to tackle these disciplines the way we currently do physics and chemistry. Wilson admits that “the social sciences are hypercomplex” and “the magnitude of the technical problems facing the social theorists is…extremely daunting,” but doesn’t take seriously enough the possibility that humanity (at least in its current form) might prove incapable of properly examining problems of sufficiently intractable complexity (199, 227). In the face of climate change and potential ecosystem collapse due to human consumption, it seems even less likely that the tools required to collect, aggregate, analyze, and act on the data most relevant to these hypercomplex problems will be produced in time to turn the tide. If ecosystems and human communities become too unstable to support scientific projects, it won’t matter if consilience is true or not because we won’t have the resources to find out.My hand-wringing is not meant as a justification for nihilism or a refutation of Wilson’s consilient ambitions, but it does serve to reveal one of his great blind spots: the contingency of the foundation on which the scientific project is constructed. Wilson, in other works as well as this one, is inconsistent in his assessment of exactly how fragile humanity’s continued quest for knowledge might be. He is comfortable pronouncing that, “Every contour of the terrain, every plant and animal living in it, and the human intellect that masters them all, can be understood as a physical entity” (258). He doesn’t hesitate to assure us of humanity’s eventual moral progress:""New answers might be found for the truly important questions of moral reasoning. How can the moral instincts be ranked? Which are best subdued and to what degree, which validated by law and symbol? How can precepts be left open to appeal under extraordinary circumstances? In the new understanding can be located the most effective means for reaching consensus. No one can guess the form the agreements will take. The process, however, can be predicted with assurance. It will be democratic, weakening the clash of rival religions and ideologies. History is moving decisively in that direction, and people are by nature too bright and too contentious to abide anything else. And the pace can be confidently predicted: Change will come slowly, across generations, because old beliefs die hard even when demonstrably false."" (280)Wilson’s steadfast optimism and faith in progress make me love him all the more; I cannot, however, personally adopt such positions with his unequivocal zeal. I fervidly hope these visions come to pass, but refuse to labor under the false god of their supposed inevitability. Wilson’s personal view appears inconclusive; despite these overly sanguine moments, he devotes much of the book’s final chapter to a compassionate but disquieting tour through the myriad contemporary threats to the viability of human communities and biodiversity.I am passionate about my melioristic worldview, but I also try to take it with a grain of salt. That grain of salt inflames the wounds of history, reminding us that all human endeavors take place under the penumbra of a stayed execution. We can pray the axe does not come down, can even invent ways to keep it hovering above us for a while longer, but we cannot stop it forever. Still, why not get consilient while we wait?This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
20,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023041-carlex,4,"Four and half stars.(I know there could be some mistakes in this review. I’m trying to improve my English, thanks)Previously I had read from Eduard O. Wilson ""The Diversity of Life"", an impressive work that among other issues announces the sixth great extinction caused by human activity (previously of the Elizabeth Kolbert's best known book). So this is my second reading by this author and ""Consilience"" not dissappoints me.Explained in a very summarized way, a very interesting treatise that introduces one of the most fundamental problems in human knowledge: the gap between “hard” and “soft” sciences. That is, natural vs. social sciences. Also the book deals with another old question: our behaviour works by genes or by culture? The answer is both, of course, but how? The former is investigated from the sociobiologist (and geneticist) paradigm and the latter from the perspective of social sciences (psychology, sociology, economics,anthropology, etc.). Also the author considers other forms of non scientific knowledge: arts, ethics and religion, also from the sociobiology point of view. From the perspective of “Consilience”, Wilson proposes an integration of all of this forms of human knowledge.For me, this book is a great contribution to know the state of the matter."
21,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6401744-ryan,2,"I read this soon after reading Herbert Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man, and it was a nice basis of contrast for Wilson's eloquent, off-the-charts intelligent, narrowly conceived, and misleading book. Most of Wilson's proposed compromises for ""Consilience"" are expected from the arts and social sciences and it is a stunning demonstration of how the positivist torch has been passed, and it could prove a perfect reference point for an updated take on Marcuse's ideas. This book is an incredibly well thought out praise of the scientist and the accomplishments of science, but it lacks any understanding of most areas of study outside of the natural sciences except for those with direct application of principles of biology, as found in biological anthropology. Having been raised Baptist, he gives a very balanced consideration of religion and ethics, as he has elsewhere, but fails to do so in other departments, especially modern art, philosophy, and sociology, most likely due to his own lack of a firm grasp of them. Natural science may understand, to an extent, the genetic basis of ""bricks"" of human nature, but it currently says little about the societal structures that we have built with them, and his near complete neglect of social science in this regard is stunning. The most mind-blowing part of the whole book for me was his dismissal with a ""it's not so bad"" of Michel Foucault's analyses of the diffuse nature of power and its evolution in the west. The crude characteristics sketched by the epigenetic basis for human nature still have little to offer such analyses 30 years after Foucault's death. Overall, I think what this book most clearly demonstrates, further shown by near-unanimous praise of Wilson, is that natural scientists are increasingly out of touch with the humanities, and are themselves preoccupied with seeking the ""holy grail"" of specific mechanistic determinants which have little bearing on the immense problems we face today. These problems are largely political and far beyond the current scope of epigenetics, and this has not changed in the 14 years since the book was written. There is, of course, ample room for astounding breakthroughs which could clearly be achieved by interdisciplinary collaboration between those with highly focused scientific training and social scientists, but instead what wilson proposes is a largely one-sided demand that the humanities need to get on board with science. If you want a well-written book on consilience within the natural sciences, which gives lip-service to other disciplines, this is pretty good. If you are looking for an olive branch, look elsewhere. For someone trained as a scientist, it is really kind of incredible to me how much of a book strictly about natural science this is, for all of its pretenses. "
22,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892816-matthew,5,"The entire thesis of Consilience is one so shockingly obvious that I was astounded to discover that true controversy surrounded it. The thesis is simply that all realms of knowledge, from biology and geology to psychology and politics, are ultimately reducible in explanation to more fundamental explanations in another discipline - physics. This seems abundantly obvious in virtually every discipline I could imagine:Example: My psychology is determined by physical states (both biological and chemical) in my brain. The biological states are reducible to more complex explanations in chemistry, and all of the chemical explanations are themselves reducible into more complicated statements couched in the language of physics. Ultimately, there may be an additional explanatory discipline more fundamental than physics. Who knows?What is obvious is that if we accept the fundamentally physical nature of the universe and the physical phenomena that occur within it, the thesis of this book is so trivially obvious as to barely warrant comment. Nevertheless, apparently there are far more supernaturalists and brain-mind dualists out there than I would have hoped."

And that is actually happening with neuroscience: there’s a field of neural economics, neural this and that, basically neural everything: literary critics, historians. People in many different disciplines are using this work on the brain to illuminate their thinking.

24,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,4,"This was a tough read mainly because of the density of the topic. But it was a masterpiece of scholarship. In making his case for a convergence of biological-physical sciences with social-humanity studies, Wilson traverses the gamut of human knowledge. From a history of the enlightenment philosophies to genetics, neurology to theology, ecology to economics, and more, he overturns stones from many disciplines, showing their interconnectivity and interspersing the dialogue with quotes from Bacon to Psalms to Milton, and drawing from his own expertise in myrmecology, evolutionary biology, and planetary conservation. This is a seminal work that has not been welcomed by academia (and not without some justification), and could eventually prove to be a lost leader, but should be extolled for its pioneering spirit and innovativeness. Touché, Brave Wilson. "
25,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"This read can be summed up in the titular word, it’s a look at how experts in different areas of science do not know how to converse with others, even within their own branch of investigation and important discoveries may be falling through these gaps. There is just SO much knowledge out there that individual genius has to dedicate itself to one small area of the cutting edge which has its own specific level of jargon. An interesting read although at times dry, I especially like his derogatory stance against post-modernism and felt quite a rile against the logical positivists rigidity of approach."

However, 20 years later, the book feels not only dated but unnecessarily wordy. I would only read this book if you are ready to settle in for the long haul, are a lover of science, or have a very long attention span. Even then, there are more recent books that cover many of the topics in this book in more detail.Many of the topics Wilson writes about have seen so much progress since publication that it is almost painful to read about things that we know have already happened. Regarding the wordiness, Consilience is one of the few books I have read in a while that felt like a slog. The combination of winding sentences and incredibly complex phrasing made this book feel like reading one long SAT passage. I recognize that E.O.

32,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
33,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
34,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
35,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
36,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
37,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
38,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
40,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."
41,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,4,"Wilson shoots for the moon and scores. Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
43,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
44,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."
45,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954931-jessamyn-smallenburg,5,"Edward O. Wilson was a biology instructor at Harvard for over 40 years. In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

52,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
53,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
54,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
55,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
56,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
57,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
58,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
59,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."
60,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046991-ben-rogers,3,Good book. Interesting concepts and learned a lot. Can be a little dry at times though.

62,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
63,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
64,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
65,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
66,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
67,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "

Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."

It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."

Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
73,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
74,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

82,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
83,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
84,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
85,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
86,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
87,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
88,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
89,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

92,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
93,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
94,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
95,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
96,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
97,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
98,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
100,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."
101,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,4,"Wilson shoots for the moon and scores. Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
103,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
104,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

112,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
113,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
114,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
115,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
116,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
117,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
118,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
119,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

122,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
123,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
124,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
125,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
126,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
127,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
128,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
130,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."

Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
133,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "

I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

Consilience is an attempt to connect different areas of human understanding and human exploration. Basically it tries to show how taking an empirical, scientific approach to other divisions of human knowledge will make it easier for us to understand our world.

142,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
143,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
144,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
145,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
146,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
147,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
148,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
149,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

152,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
154,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
155,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
156,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
157,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
158,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
160,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."
161,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,4,"Wilson shoots for the moon and scores. Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
163,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
164,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."
165,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954931-jessamyn-smallenburg,5,"Edward O. Wilson was a biology instructor at Harvard for over 40 years. In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

172,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
173,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."

Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
175,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
176,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
177,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
178,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
179,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

182,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
183,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
184,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
185,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
186,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
187,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "

Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."

It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."

Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
193,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
194,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

202,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
203,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
204,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
205,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
206,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
207,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
208,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
209,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

212,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
213,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
214,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
215,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
216,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
217,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "

Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes.

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
220,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."
221,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,4,"Wilson shoots for the moon and scores. Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
223,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
224,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

Consilience is an attempt to connect different areas of human understanding and human exploration. Basically it tries to show how taking an empirical, scientific approach to other divisions of human knowledge will make it easier for us to understand our world. A wonderful book for those looking to bridge the gaps between the humanities, social sciences, arts, and natural sciences."

232,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
233,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
234,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
235,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
236,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
237,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
238,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
239,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

242,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
243,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33352366-elari,4,"Since I started college seven years ago, I have boinged from the sciences (biology) to the social sciences (psychology) to the sciences (neuroscience) to the humanities (history and philosophy of science). This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
244,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
245,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
246,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
247,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
248,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
250,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."

Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
253,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "

I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."

In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

Consilience is an attempt to connect different areas of human understanding and human exploration. Basically it tries to show how taking an empirical, scientific approach to other divisions of human knowledge will make it easier for us to understand our world.

262,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."
263,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79191615-whiskey,0,"Wilson develops the idea of unified learning when gaining insight into nature during his science studies. His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."
264,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read that opens the reader to a vast number of topics related to epistemology (theories of knowledge). Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
265,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
266,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
267,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
268,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
269,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."

272,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A million years ahead of his time or impossible?In this ambitious work, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction. ""...[A]ll tangible phenomena,"" he writes on page 266, ""from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.""This in a nutshell is his dream of ""consilience."" It is also the statement of a determinist. My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it? It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again. It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever. He notes, ""Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground."" Will this work? Wilson's answer is no. He writes, ""...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget. They cannot even imagine how to do it."" He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, ""they could not then put the community back together again. Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.""				This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge. I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem. There is a dictum among poets that ""nothing defines the poem but the poem itself."" No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick. This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience. Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem. At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience. In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975). And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000). What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing! For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior. But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, ""We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture."" Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed. Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants. Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves. But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions. I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.	 Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

This unconventional path roves with the thrill of a roller coaster—nothing surpasses the ineffable beauty of ""the most complex object known in the universe to itself"" and the mind that emerges from it—but it often constricts into a vexing tightrope when the excitement brakes in mid-air, caught between the crude objectivity of science and the vain whimsy of, well, everything else. Achieving a vision that reconciles the two ends of the spectrum is both my compass and my dream. As such, I live the life of a nomad perpetually chasing after a rainbow that never draws near. That rainbow, at all levels from optics to aesthetics, is consilience.Of course, the book reeks of materialism. There is no evenhanded respect for all human disciplines. The humanities especially are swept under the rug, and no consideration is given whatsoever to philosophy, literature, or art, beyond their description as manifestations of brain activity, if anything at all. Consilience seems to equate reductionism; electrical firing and structural networks define the individual, while genes + environment define culture. Something has gone amiss in the all-encompassing view."
274,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"E.O. Wilson deserves immense credit for having kickstarted the evolutionary psychology movement, for having fought for Enlightenment values and secularism, for challenging religious dogma and pseudoscientific scholarship, for popularizing cross-species sociobiology, for preserving a unified vision of the sciences, for fighting hard against the crusted ""two cultures"" interpretation of academia, etc... However, a lot of the arguments in Consilience simply do not stand up to scrutiny. For this reason, my following review might seem unduly harsh. But I think the book calls for it. However, let me emphasize how much I admire Wilson's aim if not the execution. We desperately need scientists to advance the goals of the Enlightenment scientific holism and systems thinking through the facilitation of interdisciplinary continuity and coherence. Wilson paints a glorious picture of the onward march of progress that is beautiful and awesome as a call for arms. Consilience is an inspirational research program. However, it mostly succeeds on the level of aspiration, not execution. It fumbles on a few basic errors that are deeply rooted in its DNA. The biggest flaw in the book is that it fails to offer a compelling reason to agree with the basic premise of consilience, the unity of the sciences. It is one thing to say that, in principle, all the sciences are dealing with the same world that operates according to the same laws. Or that, in principle, all of the sciences are interlinked by ""a seamless web of cause and effect."" So much has been argued by great philosophers of science since Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant (you know, the same people whom Wilson largely dismisses are irrelevant). It is another thing entirely to offer sound epistemological, methodological, or ontological reasons for such unity. Or to successfully fill in the gaps in understanding to fully bridge the disciplines. Wilson paints a glorious picture of a unified science - something I am largely in agreement with - but botches up the job by (over)reaching, with insufficient humility, into areas where he has little expertise in.The haughty tone of the author is everywhere in the book. This haughtiness is a mask that hides an ignorance of philosophy combined with an incompetence in argumentation. Let me only give you two telling examples of Wilson's unjustifiable arrogance, those of ethics and free will.Example 1: ETHICS. Wilson makes the stunning claim that the ""is-ought"" problem in philosophy, as introduced by David Hume and reiterated by several other philosophers, is nothing but a pseudo-problem. This groundbreaking claim, if it is true, would indeed be a major advance in philosophy. Most philosophers still think that by studying the evolutionary origins of ethical beliefs, sentiments, or customs, can give us good explanations of the origins of ethics but cannot ground our actions one way or another. In other words, by explaining how ethics evolved (and continues to evolve) cannot tell us WHY we should obey various ethical rules as opposed to others. So, how does Wilson solve this problem? Well... he doesn't. Nothing in his analysis suggests that he has even grasped the scope of the problem. He makes the elementary mistakes of an amateur. At best, he argues like an undergraduate who is barely paying attention in class. He claims that people follow various rules because they comport to their biological sentiments. So much is obvious. From this he deduces that we do not need transcendental origins of ethics. Alright. But why should someone who doesn't agree with society's norms follow them? Why should the majority have the right to compel criminals and deviants to obey standard norms? Why should the ""is"" lead to ""ought""? He appeals to the sentimentalist philosophy of Hutcheson and Hume as the best approximation of his view without realizing that it is precisely the sentimentalist philosophy of Hume that refutes his argument. As Hume knew, a naturalist account of ethics cannot ground normativity - at least not without much more hard philosophical work of the sort that Wilson, as an anti-philosopher, self-righteously scorns. By denying the problem, Wilson has done nothing to solve it.Example 2: FREE WILL. Wilson also attempts to ""solve"" the problem of free will. He claims that free will certainly exists because people need to believe in free will in order to operate although the natural sciences cannot justify a belief in a transcendental source of freedom. He ends up affirming free will, much like he ends up affirming ethics - by much bluster and groundless assertions, without managing to ground either one in the natural sciences or evolutionary explanations. He thereby ""solves"" philosophical problems to his satisfaction (but to no one else's) by ignoring or redefining the problems and moving on. You will notice that this strategy is how he ""solves"" all hard philosophical problems. Having done so, he can laugh at philosophers, self-satisfied.As the above examples demonstrate, Wilson is not entirely UNAWARE of the hard debates in philosophy but he is both ignorant and incompetent in his efforts to solve them. A little bit of intellectual humility would have helped a great deal here. The book does not NEED to solve all of these problems in order to make its central point. In a similar way, the book does not NEED to attempt to fill in the gaps between natural sciences and the humanities to make its point. But, as you might have guessed, that's exactly what Wilson attempts to do. God help us.Example 3: ARTS AND HUMANITIES. This is the big one. The whole premise of the book is that consilience demands that we apply natural scientific understanding into the humanities and the social sciences. So, the reader is naturally curious to learn what Wilson has to say about literary criticism. He spends a lot of time lambasting some of the excesses of postmodernism. The second rate acolytes of Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Derrida deserves most of the scorn that comes their way. But this book is a good reminder that second rate acolytes of Darwin, Dawkins, and Wilson might conceivably be even worse - at least if Wilson's middling attempts are anything to go by.The two big problems with Wilson's forays into the arts and humanities are very similar to what's wrong with his forays into philosophy: 1) A self-assured cockiness based on a superficial familiarity with the relevant literature, combined with an optimistic conviction, bordering on faith, that evolutionary theory holds all the answers to major problems. 2) On this basis, Wilson thinks that he can just ignore some of the best practices and traditions in those fields and to substitute his own, without recognizing the structural dissimilarities between various fields or the need for divergent explanatory paradigms in those fields. He tosses aside all the nuances in his application of evolutionary theory to literary criticism, religious studies, psychotherapy, or anthropology, and so. He is not content to merely offer evolutionary explanations as enriching complements. This would be fine. The problem is that he does so indiscriminately, overbearingly, and crudely. True ""consilience"" must live up to the promise of a mutual enrichment, the deepening of the standards of rigour, and the recognition of the basic building blocks of science, across disciplines. It demands complex explanatory power and self-enrichment that the humanities, at best, aspire towards. If ""consilience"" demands that we interpret religious symbolism based on evolutionary psychology, for example by seeing the Satanic snake in the garden of Eden as a representative of our evolved phobia of snakes, it is a rather feeble enterprise that threatens to impoverish the humanities. It speaks little to deep psychological urges or our mythological mind. The role of evolutionary explanations in the arts and humanities is profound. In particular, nothing in the humanities or the arts should blatantly CONTRADICT our best natural scientific understanding of man and society. It should not be a bastion of pseudoscientific, religious, or supernatural explanations. And there is no excuse for the humanities to ignore the latest developments in psychology, evolutionary theory, neuroscience, etc. Even physics and molecular biology must inform the basic Weltanschauung of the arts and the humanities. But the different sciences are looking at different aspects of the unified reality. As a result, they must perforce rely on different methodologies and aspirations, at least for the time being. To be sure, literary criticism or gender studies should not be based on the debunked psychology of the Oedipus complex or the debunked economics of Marxism. But nor should it enslave itself to Darwinism. I wavered quite a bit between a 3 star and a 4 star review. In a different mood I might have pivoted to the upper bound. But I think a 3 star rating is a better representation of the value of the book in 2020. In some ways, the book is a victim of its own success: it spawned a host of imitators and detractors. Many later books are more humble and balanced. It is clear that Wilson overplayed his hand by overreaching into the arts and the humanities. His analysis falls short of the rigorous mutual respect that consilience demands. At his best, Wilson is poetic, erudite, and inspirational. At his worst, his is cocky, ignorant, and silly. Self-destructively, Wilson's project ends up alienating, rather than uniting, the various sciences. Much like Condorcet, whom Wilson greatly admired, we can greatly learn from Wilson's errors as much as benefit from his undying optimism."
275,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,5,"E.O. Wilson has written a compelling case for the unification of all knowledge through an empirical scientific world view in which everything that we know through observation, rational thought, and experience can be explained and better understood through a study of the biological roots of our human nature. He suggests that as animals humans evolved in both our physical natures and in our culture within the strictures of our genetic identities. He lays out a powerful idea that deserves to be wrestled with, but that is fraught with controversy and is not necessarily completely true. Namely, Wilson argues that the humanities as a field can only be truly understood with a knowledge of the biological natures of our brains and how our brains through physical processes give rise to our minds. He takes a reductionist view that consciousness and all that comes with it can be boiled down to the chemical reactions in our brains. This has wide reaching implications including: that culture is defined what he calls epigenetic rules defined by a combination of our genetic nature with our environment; that art is created as expression of those epigenetic rules; and most controversial, that ethics are defined by these same epigenetic rules. The last of these is dependent on the concept that there is no universal truth or universal morality which humans can search for. Instead, morality would evolve with humans as our understanding of what is right and wrong is defined by our epigenetic rules and our ability to predict cause-and-effect in the material world.This is a great book. It is twelve years old, but its ideas should continue to inform how we engage in the human endeavor for understanding. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't get everything right, but he gets enough right to spur us to consider what we know and how we treat the precious planet that serves as the environment that gave rise to us, human beings capable of understanding so much of this miracle of existence."
276,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,3,"The author defines Consilience as the unity of the sciences, in fact, all human knowledge linked together by a reduced and simple logic. The basic idea of the world view he proposes is that everything from the birth of stars to the functions of institutions that control our society can be reduced to the laws of physics. He lifts up evolutionary psychology which has become a dead-end in his efforts to justify this fantasy of his. I think he argues unconvincingly and truly sadly that for all scientific disciplines from anthropology to psychology there is one only class of explanation when it is still uncertain if anthropology and psychology should truly be classified as sciences at all. He seems to claim that the legacy of the Enlightenment is that we can know all things with our reasoning mind when the knowledge he speaks of is only one way of looking at the world, a way that is bound tightly by constrictive language that only allows for certain conclusions and abolishes others, equally true, to the dustbin. It is a contradictory dream he has and I would compare it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson's insanely unscientific statement that, ""the Cosmos is all there ever was, all there is, and all there ever will be,"" something which neither he nor the scientific establishment has known absolutely in the past, can know now, or know in the future. It is the belief in the religion of humanism with mankind's reasoning ability as a god. Wilson's insistence that we either have or will understand consciousness is an absurdity as the essence of consciousness is beyond our reason or the scientific method. One could find Wilson's enthusiasm charming in a naive 21 year old graduate student but it is certainly a sorrowful tragedy in the mind of an old man who should know better. Consilience is worth reading if you want to explore the mind of modernism, the belief that all things are reachable by reason and that which science cannot know cannot exist. Such a knowledge-limiting ideology, however, is just one way of looking at reality, a subculture of thinking among many."
277,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"“Scientists are people who know more and more about less and less, until they know everything about nothing.”In a world where most achedemics are narrowly focused on their specific area of expertise, E.O. Wilson is one of the few scientists who has the ability to not only make new discoveries in his field (he’s an entomologist specializing in the study of ants), but to draw broad, universal conclusions about the way the world works from this research (inventing the field of sociobiology and the concept of a superorganism in the process). He defines the process of linking facts and theories across scientific disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation as “Consilience” and offers it as a way of providing a deeper understanding of the world. Wilson then takes his understanding of genetics and natural selection and applies these lessons to human culture, the social sciences, the arts and religion. Wilson argues that if certain behaviors and thought processes were demonstrated to confer a survival advantage, then these traits would be more likely to be passed on to future generations. The fact that there are certain universal behaviors among all cultures and peoples lends support to this view. These universal traits include: kin selection, the different mating strategies between the sexes, incest taboos, status seeking behavior, territorial expansion and defense, contractual agreements and disapproval of cheaters, and others. This concept overlaps somewhat with the ideas of evolutionary psychology, but Wilson takes a measured approach and does not make sweeping generalizations to conclude that all behaviors are therefore genetic in origin. Wilson’s ideas, as usual, are compelling and he conveys them in an interesting manner. For some reason though, I found the book to drag and had to struggle through the final chapters. "
278,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"This may be one of the best popular science books I've ever read. Put simply, Prof. Wilson if trying to lay out the claim that all sciences: the social and the hard, at there base level, share some common epigenetic features. His arguments span several disciplines: from biology to physics to religion to economics to ethics. His arguments are compelling, and he freely admits that he may be overreaching or that the the commonalities may be too reduced to be of much value, yet the problem, the idea, is worth pursuing.I also applaud him for putting the nature/nurture (culture) argument that I personally profess to out there; namely that both play a role. Prof Wilson wrote a book that is inspiring, that I believe will convince people to pursue his goal. And really, if they prove him right or wrong, the fact that they tried, that they added to our knowledge, is all that he would want. Finally, the humor that Prof Wilson weaves throughout the book is both dry and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several of his jokes. This was something I did not expect, but was happy to discover. "

Some information is dated, as this book is now 17 years old, but most of the information is still incredibly relevant and many of Wilson's predictions for the coming years have rang true, particularly those in the chapter dealing with the brain sciences and those concerning the environment in the final chapter.Wilson dreams of a world where the hard sciences, soft sciences, and humanities alike work together to synthesize knowledge by means of universal natural laws. Not the most enjoyable book to breeze straight through, it actually took me a month to really sit down and polish off the second half in the past two days, but a good book nonetheless.I recommend this book, as the idea of consilience is one that I find myself backing and there is a lot of good information in this book, but if reading the full book is not easily feasible, I recommend the final chapter definitely."
280,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Wilson made his name in ants, as a rock star entomologist who made seminal contributions to the understanding of one of the most successful species of all time. It must not have been challenging enough for him, because this book is all about the unity of knowledge, where he tries to both explain why past attempts to bridge the divide between the arts and the sciences have failed (his verdict: they were based on ""failed models of the brain""), and to chart out a new path for the synthesis of the human and nonhuman studies by basing them in the techniques of the natural sciences, which might be, to borrow from Churchill, ""the worst way to study the world, except for all the others"". As a science fan, I really enjoyed his clear-eyed appraisal of why science has been successful in doing what it does, but even a more poetically-inclined person will like his appreciation for the arts, his elegant writing, and his graceful and generous demeanor."
281,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660601-charlie-george,4,"Wilson shoots for the moon and scores. Of course there will be many incensed reviews, given all the toes he steps on through the course of the book.But what he was trying to accomplish is so provocative, so profound, that I can't help but be awed. It is a call to arms against postmodernism, and a demonstration of how much poorer we are for having abandoned certain ideals of the Enlightenment.He fulfills and elucidates the materialist stance that the universe is a physical one, devoid of the supernatural. On this basis he predicts and sketches a path to true wisdom, where the scientific community cleanses itself of infighting and unites all branches of knowledge, to the enrichment of each, especially the arts."

Or if we must conclude that even we are not so individual as we seem. I get why Tom Wolfe must like this guy, but I still don't get why liberals must hate him. I think it was us liberals who caused all the harm by insisting that some get labeled ""needy"" and take handouts, when all they might have wished for was to be good worker bees with dignity. It's the dignity everyone seems desperate to withhold as our superstar culture of ever expanding want arrogates almost everything to (our?) empire. I find Wilson pleasantly humble among his accomplishments. What he understands rings true, and so I'll have to accommodate it. And he writes really well."
283,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40438874-luis,5,"As someone with no background whatsoever in biology, I must confess that a lot of the content of this book flew over my head. However, as a history student and someone with a background in the humanities, I found this to be a revelatory and thought-provoking book. It did not have much to say about my own area of study, but it covered in great detail the way our view of the arts could be revolutionised by perspectives from natural science.  I was first introduced to E.O. Wilson in a lecture 5 months ago about the relationship between history and the natural sciences. Our lecturer was dismissive of attempts to merge biology with the humanities, using the buzzwords ‘reductionist’ and ‘scientism’ as insults. I was not so convinced. I had come to recognise that, whenever the natural sciences were mentioned as part of my course, there was always a clearly detectable fear that they would somehow ‘dehumanise’ the humanities if the two ever crossed. ‘Social Darwinism’ and eugenics were used as the two prime examples of the manifestations of this ‘dehumanising’ influence. Despite having no academic background in the sciences, I have always been interested in learning about science through popular science sources on the internet and have admired the emphasis of the sciences on objectivity, logic and truth over superstition and intuition. I had always wondered why historians had avoided the whole period of history before civilisations came about as if it were not relevant. I wanted to see what E.O. Wilson would have to say about this. Somewhat disappointingly, the book hardly mentions history or historians. However, it does have some very interesting things to say about the arts. Wilson claims in chapter 10- The Arts and Their Interpretation, that art began as a way of keeping the complex algorithms of human nature intact when, as a species, we gained high intelligence. This means that high art (Shakespeare, Beethoven, Da Vinci) exists not due to inspiration from some higher power, or the influence of mystical spirits, but because of epigenetic rules (codes that create ‘human nature’) that sprung into existence simply to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction. This would, upon first glance, seem like an incredibly disturbing idea. It has always been believed that art is something inexplicable and divine. To reduce it to the basest of instincts would seem plain wrong. This, as Wilson points out, explains much of the postmodernist backlash against ‘scientism’ within literary and art criticism. However, Wilson also reassures us that art is one of the things that has made humanity so great and that explaining its existence with reference to biology does not in any way undermine it or make it less beautiful or worthwhile. Why on earth would Shakespeare’s eloquent digging to the very core of human nature be worth any less because we find out that his plays reflect epigenetic rules of creativity designed to deal with our complex human nature? On the contrary, would we not be able to appreciate his genius more be seeing how he managed to pierce right to the heart of the epigenetic rules? Obviously it is for future scholars to do the actual work in explaining creative genius and art in scientific terms, but Wilson sets a good precedent by establishing some common themes throughout literature that would reflect the underlying epigenetic rules: creation stories, emigrations to promised lands, good vs. evil battles, heroes on quests, apocalypse, sources of great power, nurturing women, seers, pure virgins, female sexual awakening, clowns disrupting established order and monsters threatening humanity.  Wilson’s predictions for the objective discovery of morality are also gripping. He predicts that the moral sentiments will first be described accurately through experimental psychology. Then, the genetic codes for these moral sentiments will be discovered, meaning it can be elucidated how the moral sentiments developed based on interaction of genes and environment. From this, the origins (‘deep history’) of religion and spirituality can be unearthed.  What I can pass comment on more decisively than the scientific aspects of the book is the refreshingly positive view Wilson holds towards the enlightenment. Due to the influence of postmodernism, which Wilson deals with well in the third chapter, it has become trendy for historians to sneer at those like Condorcet who spoke positively about human progress and the ability to reduce the world to laws and principles so that we may better understand and master it. I was enamoured by Condorcet’s suggestion in his Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind that culture, like the natural world, is reducible to a set of natural laws and principles that can be discovered. In a time when those within my own discipline have turned away from the apparently outdated enlightenment belief in the potential of humanity to, independently of any higher powers, know and understand the world objectively so that we might improve our situation, such perspectives are refreshing.  This book combines scientific rigour (which, although I grasped the basics of, I would require further study to fully grasp), a refreshing enlightenment belief in human progress and respect for the beauty of art, and reassurances that this art would not be destroyed by reducing the reasons behind it to biology. It has inspired me to search out other ways the arts/humanities and natural sciences have converged (especially through the modern incarnation of Wilson’s socobiology, evolutionary psychology). It renewed my belief in elightenment humanism despite the barrage of philosophical skepticism that made me originally cynical.  "
284,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"While I don't completely buy Wilson's argument here, I find it fascinating to consider. I like the idea of arts and sciences synthesizing--the disciplines have much to teach one another and cross-pollination, as it were, is valuable. I'm fascinated by physics, biology/botany, certain aspects of mathematics...I don't believe science trumps all, which is where Wilson ends up (at least, as I interpret him). So I think his argument goes a little too far. I liked the book, though. He has written an amazing book on ants, too."
285,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954931-jessamyn-smallenburg,5,"Edward O. Wilson was a biology instructor at Harvard for over 40 years. In his work 'Consilience,' Wilson weaves together an exposition for the unification of all scientific knowledge. His overall point is a discussion of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, a science in which human motivations are explained by genetics, and every action has a Darwinian explanation. I think this book is a great contribution to the field of evolutionary biology. Although there are arguments against its central tenets, Wilson's argument stands its ground."

292,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"In May 2001 Wendell Berry published Life is a Miracle. He wrote it as a response to Consilience, by Edward O. Wilson. Having an affinity for Wendell Berry’s writing, I read Life is a Miracle several years ago. Then this fall I read Alister McGrath’s The Big Question: Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God. McGrath also takes issue with Consilience because of Wilson’s conclusion that ethics and morality can be explained by evolution.In our current cultural environment many of us carry out our intellectual transactions in the safety of communities of like-minded people. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but since two writers whom I respect took issue with the same book by the same author, I thought I should investigate for myself.Wilson writes for an educated audience. His writing is, nonetheless, approachable and clear.The theses with which Berry and McGrath take issue are not hard to find in Consilience. According to Wilson, science is capable of telling us everything we need to know. There is no need for intervention by supernatural forces. All supernatural thinking is “ignorance-based metaphysics” which will retreat “like a vampire before the lifted cross” when presented with “objective truth.” (p. 62)Of particular interest to theists, specifically Christians who espouse young-earth creation, is Wilson’s take on this doctrine. It must be said that he speaks of the Christian’s God with respect. “Perhaps God did create all organisms,including human beings, in finished form, in one stroke, and maybe it all happened several thousand years ago. But if that is true, He also salted the earth with false evidence in such endless and exquisite detail, and so thoroughly from pole to pole, as to make us conclude first that life evolved, and second that the process took billions of years. Surely Scripture tells us He would not do that. The Prime Mover of the Old and New Testaments is variously loving, magisterial, denying, thunderously angry, and mysterious, but never tricky.” (p, 129-130)Going farther on the subject of God and God’s involvement in human affairs, Wilson observes “God may exist, He may be delighted in what we are up to on this minor planet, but His fine hand is not needed to explain the biosphere.” (p. 198) It’s interesting that this quote is in a chapter on the social sciences, and in a section on economics.Wilson uses “empiricism” to refer to a world view that understands the world solely in terms of what is observable. “Transcendentalism” allows the intervention of forces outside of what can be observed with senses extended by technology. “The choice between transcendentalism and empiricism will be the coming century’s version of the struggle for men’s souls. Moral reasoning will either remain centered in idioms of theology and philosophy, where it is now, or it will shift toward science-based material analysis. Where it settles will depend on which world view is proved correct, or at least which is more widely perceived to be correct.” (p. 240).The final chapter, “To What End,” includes what seems to be a summary statement: “What are we? Where do we come from, How show we decide where to go? Why the toil, yearning, honesty, aesthetics, exaltations, love, hate, deceit, brilliance, hubris, humility, shame, and stupidity that collectively define our species? Theology, which long claimed the subject for itself, has done badly. Still encumbered by precepts based on Iron-Age folk knowledge, it is unable to assimilate the great sweep of the real world now open for examination.” (p. 269) Ouch.Finally, this: “The legacy of the Enlightenment is the believe that entirely on our own we can know, and in knowing, understand, and in understanding, choose wisely. That self-confidence has risen with the exponential growth of scientific knowledge, which is being woven into an increasingly full explanatory web of cause and effect.” (p. 297). That speaks of a hubris that has gotten humanity into trouble since its appearance in the biosphere.I am thankful for E.O. Wilson and for his challenges to the hardened dogmas of fundamentalism. They need to be challenged. I am also grateful for the work of writers such as Wendell Berry and Alister McGrath, who have provided alternative narratives that include the work of a just and loving God."

His view of the classification of species as connected with evolution is influenced by Linnaeus, who classifies animals and species into groups, families, orders and kingdoms. This ordering reminds one of the way armies are organized with platoons, armed services heading armies, and with chiefs of staff at the top.Wilson analyzes various branches of learning, where the unification can be proved as justified and needed. The idea stems from early scientific ideas that are part of the philosophy of the Enchantment, a belief that science follows certain order while its laws are applicable in other branches. Thales of Miletus regards water as part of all matter, representing in this way a symbol of unity.The unification of knowledge is confirmed by the material world while it is also the only choice to overcome problems that the industrialized world faces as it struggles with poverty. The unity of knowledge is the basis for learning as well as making government decisions.Sparked by the Enlightenment, the unity of knowledge emerges as part of philosophical thought that is to foster human rights through knowledge. The knowledge that is united through rules applicable to more than just one area is based on the idea that physical laws can be applicable to other areas as well. Science and analysis leads to reasoning and seeking objective truth. Condorcet, Descartes, and Bacon develop philosophical thinking, where empirical evidence gains importance as part of discovery. Descartes uses deduction and analysis when examining each phenomenon. For him knowledge is a system of truths applicable also in mathematics. Another way to obtain knowledge is through systematic doubts. He proposes reductionism, where concepts are analyzed through separating elements that are then further analyzed in the same way. This concept stimulates the future direction of scientific research.Scientific pursuit is based on principles of objective truth, experiments, and evidence. It consists of patches of experiments that fit hypotheses. It should be based on real truth, using various methods of research as well as various hypotheses. Science uses fundamentals that are substantial and a variety of research methods that can benefit the future. Biological sciences especially offer discoveries that expose the power of human intellect.The complexity of the human brain represents the most challenging scientific endeavor. Its evolutionary nature involving consciousness and subconsciousness surpasses animal abilities in its propensity to analyze and use free will. It is the most complex system known in the universe which humans have failed to reproduce so far.Genes play an important role in our evolution. They determine our behavior and the way we develop along with our culture, including our avoidance of incest.Although artistic abilities fail to be identified by scientists, they stem from our natural environment. At first they manage to create certain order in the chaotic world. Later, common elements evolve along with our natural selection, such as myths.One of the most important branches of learning is ethics that incorporate biology, culture, and instincts. Although a more objective analysis is needed in this area it determines the way we approach our world and the environment, deciding, ultimately, our future. All areas of learning benefit through consilience. Human evolution changes the world allowing for the volitional evolution to the detriment of our environment. Despite these advances the destruction on the earth that threatens our survival calls for urgent actions in the area of the environment that also involves ethics."

Wilson uses the term consilience to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different academic disciplines (the sciences, humanities and arts). His main goal is to synthesize information from various different fields (physics, mathematics, language, religion, politics, economics) into a unified fact-based theory in order to create a common groundwork of explanation (or understanding). I personally identified enormously with the theory of consilience and even proceeded to organize my notes from years of nonfiction reading into the framework proposed by Wilson. This was an excellent exercise for mental filing and to review the information which I consider to be most valuable in human history. I divided the consilience of my knowledge into the following hierarchy:•Physics (knowledge of nature): study of nature through scientific inquiry (laws & principles). This includes the hard sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy. •Philosophy (love of wisdom): the study of the first things of nature. (existence, mind, knowledge, language, reason). I further divided this into 3 eras (favorites in parentheses): ancient (Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius); Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus); Modern (Montaigne, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein). •Humanities and arts (social sciences): the study of human culture and society. Linguistics, economics (allocation of resources), politics (governance, rule of law), sociology (religion, cultures), literature, music What I liked•The main ideas presented and the overall consilience of information by Wilson. It takes a privileged mind to be able to tackle such a vast array of subjects and synthesize them into a narrative that readers can understand. •Epigenetic rules: the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. (incest aversion, fear of snakes). This is a main theory that Wilson develops throughout the book with different examples; its fascinating. •Complexity. The best description of complexity I have ever read: ""The love of complexity without reductionism makes art; the love of complexity with reductionism makes science.""•Reductionism: the breaking apart of nature into its natural constituents. It is the search strategy employed to find points of entry into otherwise impenetrably complex fields.•Scientism: Scientific theories are a product of imagination, informed imagination. 4 qualities of scientific theory: parsimony, generality, consilience, predictiveness. Scientists as a rule do not discover to know, they know in order to discover. (loved this phrasing) • I enjoyed Wilson’s unique worldview as a biologist. He not only has a detailed understanding of biological anthropology, but also places equal importance on the effects of cultural anthropology. As an open minded thinker, he’s able to learn from different fields without bias. He’s a fox without a doubt. A polymath who truly enjoys learning and cares for the environment and humanity. What could be improved•The writing and editing could be better. Some sections drag on and are not particularly easy to understand. I don’t consider Consilience to be a popular book that could be read and understood by the average reader. Since Wilson covers so many topics, the reader must have a solid scientific knowledge base to follow Wilson’s arguments. •The book was written in 1998, it could use an afterword updating findings in several fields over the past 20 years. For example, the human genome project wasn’t completed until 2003. Read in: May 2020. 4/5. "
295,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16231077-jos-angel-hernandez,5,"Professor Edward O. Wilson is perhaps one of America's greatest living scientists and definitely one of our greatest living intellectuals. All of the praise that has been noted by other reviewers is accurate and to the point, even those that are somewhat critical of this particular monograph, whose aim is almost impossible, but the arguments are laid out in such positive and promising ways.Some others have laid out almost paragraph for paragraph some of the many arguments and the amazing depth and breadth of Professor Wilson's knowledge, and they are not incorrect in their assessment. But as Wilson himself notes, even as he critiques the annoying post-modern positions, each reader does Come Away with something different depending on their subjectivity. This is not to suggest that there is not some set of natural laws that academics and scientists should subscribe to, my only point is that in a review like this each of us comes away with something different and is impressed with various aspects of such a brilliant and extensive analysis of the Sciences and the humanities and the social sciences.Therefore what I came away with was actually inline with the title of the book, which is consilience, or the unity of knowledge. What Wilson is attempting to lay out here is a kind of a road map whereby the Natural Sciences, social sciences and humanities can have some particular overlap and goal that unifies all of their knowledge in order to better The Human Condition and the future of humanity. Such a bold project, typical for Professor Wilson, is unlikely to be answered, but of the many monographs that I have had the privilege of reading, his was the most promising and the most elegant that I have come across. His knowledge as everyone knows, is almost superhuman, and the constant sprinkling of poetry, and art, and music, and literature, and economics, is incredibly intimidating, but all of it so nicely placed and employed within his arguments.If there was a critique of a book, and I would not even dare to suggest any quibble with such a wonderful project that is written so beautifully, it is that I was quite surprised--as someone who teaches historiography--that some past philosophers that have suggested similar projects were not employed (historiographically that is...) in this particular study, namely German historian and philosopher Wilhem Dilthey, the GWF Hegel Chair of Philosophy, University of Berlin. Like Wilson, Dilthey is still notorious amongst historians of philosophy and philosophers of History for setting about projects that he could never finish, or to be more kind, projects that he knew would never be finished in his lifetime. Just like the Spanish architect Gaudi of Barcelona, who knew that his Masterpiece would never be completed in his lifetime, Dilthey too set about to outline this impossible task of uniting the Natural Sciences with the other fields into what he referred to as ""the human Sciences."" Hence, while reading Wilson my mind would frequently daydream back to Dilthey's 1883 ""Introduction to the Human Sciences,"" thinking the whole time whether or not this was an oversight on the part of the author, or because of Dilthey's difficult prose.Whatever the case may be, and even with my minor quibbles, I have made it my goal to read through all of Professor Wilson monographs, and wishing the whole time I had come across his work sooner. he is truly America's greatest living intellectual and Scholar, and my hero.Respectfully, Joseangel"
296,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897161-david-layton,4,"Entomologist Edward O. Wilson took on a big task with this book. The idea was to argue that the large fields of knowledge - empirical, social, ethical, and spiritual - are gradually merging, though not in the way often imagined. Wilson gives the name of the merger as ""consilience,"" which occurs when the facts and inductions in one domain of knowledge coincide with facts and inductions of another domain of knowledge. Wilson argues that this consilience has largely already happened in the empirical sciences, and is only just glimmering on the horizon for linkages between the empirical sciences and the other fields of knowledge. Wilson believes that inevitably, within the restraints of possibility, this larger-scale consilience will happen, but also believes that it ought to happen and that the impact of human population growth on the Earth's sustaining capacity is the crisis necessitating that other fields of knowledge follow the lead of science in removing their heads from clouds of ""transcendentalism"" and get down to the serious business of solving this problem. Wilson argues that the center of this consilient understanding of knowledge is recognizing the biological foundation of humanity. In other words, from biology we get psychology, then sociology, and then the ""epigenetic"" products of society such as arts and religion. One of the virtues of the book is that Wilson is not arguing that he has ""the"" answer to solving the great problems or unifying knowledge. He is very careful to state clearly wherever he is speculating or uncertain. The argument here is that knowledge is unifying, not that Wilson has the plan to make it unify. Similarly, Wilson is aware that his criticisms of psychology, sociology, arts, and religion as woefully inept are going to meet with strong reactions. Thus, Wilson is never accusatory or dogmatic, and he tries to state his criticisms in the mildest way he can think of. At the heart of his concern is that fields of knowledge that should take the biological basis of humanity as a fact, instead pointlessly reject all biologically based arguments on grounds that are wholly ideological, without consideration of scientific practice in biological sciences or of the material fact of humans as biological entities. Reasonable criticisms of Wilson's book would be that Wilson is not as widely read in many of the subject areas he discusses as he ought to be. He seems especially out of his depth in the field of humanities, both with regard to art works and critical theory of art works (although one can forgive him with regard to critical theory, since so much of it is as he describes it, obscurantist ramblings). His sweeping, big-picture approach means that in many places he is not sufficiently justifying what ought to be justified, especially when he speculates about what he thinks a consilient theory of extra-scientific fields would look like. What makes the book mostly a success is that Wilson gives the reader room to think. The writing is straightforward, non-technical for the most part, and decorated with folksy metaphors that give one the impression that he wants to talk with the reader and not lecture the reader."
297,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"An eye opening book on the Unity of Knowledge. A lot of good information about science and the progress of science, as well as a look into the implications of a fully scientific worldview. It does seem to make a lot of sense: you see something in some place, and connect it with things you have seen in other places, which makes you think it's all the same. I especially like Wilson's take on Archetypes, Art and Myth, which is an interesting fuse into biological thinking. That said, modern day reader's will probably need to share Wilson's wonder with the natural world in order to find lasting meaning in this worldview. Another interesting part of the book is that Wilson anticipates the battle in modern society with ""postmodernism"" about 20 years before it has it the main-stream. Postmodernism aims at de-legitimization of all worldviews, and instead interpreting the author's lense. It's a terrible outlook on life, that surely leads into culture of nihilism. Wilson talks about ""fragmentation"" of knowledge, which is all too true today. Incentive structures and anxiety lead modern researchers to pursue whatever it takes to establish success in their professions. The path towards doing this is mastering a small, piece of knowledge that fits with the collective unconscious of the discipline, and no one else has worked on. I remember talking with people awhile back on there not being any ""generalists"" like we read about in the past. Folks who had takes on economics, math, statistics, etc. I wonder if this is just because the amount of information becomes overwhelming, or if the psyche of academia isn't what we read about. Or maybe it is quite similar, and we only read about the top scholars of previous ages. Statistically, it is interesting that this book is in response to ""The Two Cultures"" book comparing science and the humanities. This title will sound familiar to statisticians, as an influential paper by Leo Breiman was: ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures"". I wonder, have we found our version of consilience in the discipline?Wilson also has an interesting line: ""If the natural sciences can be successfully united with the social sciences and humanities, the liberal arts in higher education will be revitalized. Even the attempt to accomplish that much is a worthwhile goal. Profession-bent students should be helped to understand that in the twenty-first century the world will not be run by those who possess mere information alone. Thanks to science and technology, access to factual knowledge of all kinds is rising exponentially while dropping in unit cost. It is destined to become global and democratic. Soon it will be available everywhere on television and computer screens. What then? Then answer is clear: synthesis. We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, to think critically about it, and make important choices wisely."""
298,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39806269-lionel-snell,4,"This book is a wonderful hymn of praise for science. It gives an excellent summary of the development and successes of scientific method - especially in recent centuries when the physical sciences became unified as a hierarchy such as quantum theory>particle physics>classical physics>chemistry>genetics>biology. thus each scientific discipline, however diverse its language, can relate to others via a common substrate and so achieve a powerful unity. As an example of non-consilience, he compares the social sciences such as economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology etc. Here there is a reluctance to find common ground in human genetics, evolution or biology – there is even a suggestion that it is paternalistic or colonial to refer social sciences to physical sciences. As a result, the disciplines are fragmented, politicised and make little progress. He makes a good case that it would be better if the social sciences did back their theories with reference to human genetics, evolution etc and so become more consilient.He then moves on to other human cultures – the arts and religion –and how they too might make more progress if they paid more attention to their foundations in the evolution of the human brain and society. Thus he argues for a consilience of all human cultures, without denying their importance.I liked this book because it made a good case, and because it aligned with my own model of 4 human cultures - magic art science and religion. Like me he sees these cultures in broad terms and ascribes politics, tribalism and ethics to the religious culture. But he does not recognise a distinct magical culture as I do, instead he includes it in the arts. My point of departure is that I am not sure that a unified consilient culture is such a good aim. Yes, it would be more progressive, but I believe that evolutionary progress along a too specific path can be dangerous. Most creatures come to dominate a certain ecological niche by specialising - birds that lose their forelimbs to flight, sharks that achieve dominance by ferocity and so on. But the species most able to adapt and survive are the ones with less, not more, specialisation. Humans are like that: we do not have wings, claws, stings, camouflage or special attributes. Yes, we are exceptionally rational, but we are also exceptionally artistic, religious and irrational. Rather than wish to unite all our characteristics into one rational framework, I believe that it is the churn between the different cultural approaches that keeps us so diverse and so adaptable. It might put a brake on linear progress, but it could be the clue to our survival against super intelligent invaders or advanced AI."
299,067976867X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721451-nicolas,5,"Let me preface this by stating I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to scientific literature. However, to my (admittedly scant) knowledge, this has to be perhaps the single most important book in Science - now - in light of the comprehensive blueprint it outlines for the expansion of human understanding. No small words. Consilience is humbling in scope, modest in tone, rigorous in its truth claims and value judgments, and incredibly bold and crucial in vision. Combining rich philosophical, scientific, and literary perspectives, E. O. Wilson makes an absolutely brilliant and convincing case for the (re)union of the natural and social sciences as the key to solving our greatest interdisciplinary challenges - staving off climate change, saving earth's biosphere, implementing a sustainable global economic strategy with vastly better predictive power, devising an inclusive world ethics rooted in sound scientific knowledge of the biological basis of mind, piecing together consciousness from both the culture/nurture and genetic/nature perspectives...... merely some of the gaps in our understanding waiting to be mapped by concilient scientific generalists working in tandem at the permeable boundaries of human knowledge. Dismiss the claim of the postmodern relativists: that Truth cannot be attained. This leads down the road of extreme skepticism to the fortifief cult of the antiexpert (where we are now) and ultimately, to ubiquitous hyperreality, moral equivocation, decadence and decline. No. Some measure of truth is, demonstrably, achievable in our universe. Consilience isn't just possible, it's probable, and practitioners and communicators of Science ought not to recognize an unspannable gap in the Mind-Body problem and its resultant two cultures, the natural sciences and humanities, which have diverged since the Enlightenment, to the detriment of knowledge as a whole. From the very small to the very large, in unbroken continuity, all can and ought to be explored; no mystery is too sacrosanct for the roving eye of curiosity. Accepting anything less is effectively to engage in intellectual surrender. To understand Consilience, to proselytize its possibility, to begin implementing its ultimate aim - the unity of knowledge - these are the first steps for humanity on the road to finally meriting its epithet: Sapiens - Wise. Seven stars. But don't take this on my authority. Read it. Share it. Wrap it in fine paper and give it as a gift. Sleep with it under your pillow."
