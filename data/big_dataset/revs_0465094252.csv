0,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"Sabine Hossenfelder is a theoretical physicist, and she's pretty mad about the way her subject has gone over the last thirty years. She's written this book to tell you why she's mad, and what she's done to try and find out what went wrong. She's talked with a bunch of people, some of them major stars of the physics world. She's asked them questions and she reports their answers. Somehow, even though a fair amount of it is near-incomprehensible physics-speak, she makes it cool and funny. She's got a great voice, laid back and detached and deadpan. She reminds me a little bit of Jessica Chastain in Molly's Game. Jessica's talking about poker and Sabine's talking about physics, but the two subjects aren't as far apart as you first think. When you come down to it, they're both high-stakes gambling games.Physics is on a losing streak. It went all-in with the Large Hadron Collider and bet fifteen billion dollars that it would find supersymmetric particles. (The Higgs was just the consolation prize; Sabine says that was pretty much a given). Most of the experts thought the supersymmetric particles were there, but they didn't show up. Physics tossed in a few billion more to upgrade the LHC to higher energies, and there were still no supersymmetric particles. Now it's sitting hunched over its cards as dawn begins to break, wondering what it's going to say to its wife.The problem is that the stakes have gotten so high that the physics gambling syndicate can only afford to play a few hands. Most of the time, it has to fold. It needs to be very careful about the hands it does choose to play, the ideas that involve setting up a real experiment. They have an army of experts, the theoreticians, whose job it is to give them advice on which experiments might be worthwhile; Sabine is one of those experts. It's a frustrating life. Usually, you know you're developing an idea which will never be tested. In practice, the theoreticians now present their work mostly to each other. They judge it by aesthetic standards, and fashion also plays a large role. Fundamental physics has entered a decadent period.The theoreticians deny that anything is wrong. Mathematical beauty is very important, they say. It's our only real guide to what distinguishes a promising theory from an unpromising one. Supersymmetry was so beautiful that it had to be true; Nature has so far refused to agree, but maybe they just need to build a larger collider. In contrast, the Standard Model, which is universally agreed to be hideously ugly, irritates the hell out of everyone by passing all the experimental tests they can throw at it. It is in fact rather confusing when you write it down.Sabine is suspicious about the cult of beauty. She upsets theoreticians when she suggests that it might not be scientific to work this way. She points out that many ideas now considered brilliant and beautiful were called monstrosities when they first appeared. (Quantum mechanics was a bit of an ugly duckling). She thinks scientists should read more philosophy and sociology, and try to understand their real motivations. In case you're in any doubt, she gives plenty of details about just what isn't working. She tells you where the bodies are buried, with little sketch maps and instructions on how deep to dig. She says people tried to talk her out of writing Lost in Math, and that now she'll never get tenure. It's pretty interesting to see someone telling the truth, and you realise how seldom that happens. I just couldn't put this book down."

This forces theorists to draw upon criteria other than empirical adequacy to decide which research avenues to pursue. Aesthetic appeal is one of them. In our search for new ideas, beauty plays many roles. It’s a guide, a reward, a motivation. It is also a systematic bias“In “Lost in Math - How Beauty Leads Physics Astray” by Sabine HossenfelderOne of the most obnoxious notions I’ve ever read in Physics is the one that purports that we’re a simulation. If it's all a simulation, why wouldn't the world that simulated us be a simulation too? This is the turtles all the way down idea. This doesn't mean it isn't true but it's also the same question as, if God created the universe and us, who created God? The answer I sometimes get when I say it’s all hogwash, is that the theory is aesthetically pleasing. Where is the evidence? And more importantly, is it “implausifiable” (I’m borrowing here Hossenfelder’s term)? The supposed evidence for our universe being a simulation seems to largely include the idea that if we extrapolate our technological progress further ahead in time, we will be able to build such a simulation ourselves *therefore* we are a simulation."

If you just want a straight review, go to Steven Woit’s, linked below. My first impressions: theoretical physicists are supposed to come up with stuff that can be tested by experiment. If you can’t test the idea, or if it flunks the test, you move on (see Feynman). Physicists have been working away for *30 years* to try to improve the Standard Model. Basically, no recent progress. This should be a hint to the physics community. Instead, they’ve doubled down on untestable stuff like String Theory, that, to some physicists’ eyes, is beautiful. But: “Who gives a fuck what you like or dislike? Nature doesn’t care”— this is hotshot physicist Nima Arkani-Hamed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nima_Ar... , in a pungent interview with the author. Unlike the author, he’s a tenured physicist at Princeton, and says he’s found his dream job.My outsider thoughts: just about all the physicists Hossenfelder talked to *hate* the Standard Model, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standar..., mostly because it’s “ugly”, and incomplete. Well, so what? It works, and if it ain’t broke, why fix it? It’s not like there isn’t plenty of other cool stuff for physicists to work on. Such as, current physics only accounts for maybe 5% of the known universe. Dark Energy (68%) and Dark Matter (27%) supposedly are the rest, and we have NO CLUE what they are made of! C’mon, girls and boys, Nobel Prizes await you….Hossenfelder has written a breezy catch-up text for modern physics, well suited for people like me, whose formal exposure to physics ended decades ago. And I can *almost* understand most of the stuff she’s talking about. This is a Big Deal, and very rare in popular science books. So, read it for that, and her cool interviews with top physicists, and her pungent remarks about her chosen field. I wish her well. It must get *really old* to be an eternal postdoc, which is how she’s spent the last 15 years. She has a new appointment now, but it's another short-term contract. She says she'll be fine when that runs out, https://backreaction.blogspot.com/201.... Go, Sabine!Here’s a good, long, detailed review of the book by Peter Woit, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Woit , a theoretical physicist who is also critical of String Theory. This is the review to read first. Woit says, “you should get the book and read the whole thing” Indeed.http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wo...Lots of links, too.And here's a Reading Strategy for non-technical readers:1. Read the first and last chapters2. Read her end-of-chapter summaries for the rest.3. Read the interviews! Some of the best stuff is here. Previews at http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wo... Steven Weinberg!4. Don't worry about the rest."
3,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"A quick summary of the book’s contents: Many physicists these days are inclined to believe that beautiful, elegant theories are the only ones truly worth pursuing. Hossenfelder argues that this is the main reason why there hasn’t been a major breakthrough in the foundations of physics for over 40 years. She asserts that this often debilitating aesthetic criteria has become a rigidly adhered-to dogma, and that physicists are in fact beating themselves soundly with their own outworn yardstick. She contends that this bias now interferes heavily with objectivity, which, believe it or not, is kind of an essential ingredient to any scientific discipline. This thought-provoking analysis of the limitations of beauty as a guideline is presented alongside several intriguing interviews of current physicists, which are interspersed throughout the text.Topics examined in depth, or else merely touched on, poked fun at, ogled lasciviously (hey, physics can be pretty sexy!), or otherwise brought to the reader’s attention, include: a brief history of physics, the standard model of particle physics, supersymmetry, the notion of “naturalness,” string theory, the multiverse, quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, grand unification, and issues with the basic structure and methodology of the scientific community which unfortunately tend to discourage innovation.Pros: I agree wholeheartedly with her main thesis, which is essentially that dogma has no absolutely place in science, and that scientists should be wary of biases which may be coloring their perspective and influencing their methodology. (This is obviously a gross oversimplification of her case, and I would urge anyone interested in her exact arguments and supporting evidence, to read the book themselves. While it isn’t terribly long, it is terribly illuminating and informative.) Also, the interviews were quite fascinating; it was very helpful to hear what various big names in physics had to say on the matter at hand. And lastly, I couldn’t help but enjoy her snarky sense of humor. The book is full of unexpectedly sarcastic remarks, and I found this undeniably refreshing. For instance, here is her (humorous) rationale for studying history:
“While I was in school I hated history, but since then I have come to recognize the usefulness of quoting dead people to support my convictions.”
Very cute.Cons: At times, it was a bit repetitive, and could have benefited from more rigorous editing and tighter overall organization. It is also heavier on Philosophy of Science than I was expecting it to be, though this is clearly a subjective preference—perhaps you’re a fervid devourer of that kind of thing, in which case the abundance of philosophical material will instead constitute a distinct advantage.Bottom line: I am not a theoretical physicist, so I can’t really directly address any of the higher level physics Hossenfelder critiques. I will instead content myself here with reiterating what I thought was the strongest aspect of her principal argument: Dogma can be positively insidious. It can creep into areas, such as theoretical physics, you wouldn’t think would stand for it. The most important thing you can do is to be ever vigilant that your own thinking doesn’t become twisted, caged, or otherwise hindered by anything of that sort. Clearly, this is a truth applicable not only to modern physics, but to any field of science, and, more importantly, to life in general. Lost in Math serves as a powerful reminder of this fact, and furthermore discusses quite a few strange and interesting facets of modern physics along the way. As such, it packs a considerable punch, and is well worth reading."
4,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,"Hossenfelder is a theoretical physicist. This is her first book written for the lay audience. The author is a research fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies in Germany. The book is about the abuse of mathematics while pretending to do science. The book is a series of interviews with well-known physicists. She builds a case of how science fails to self-correct itself and set about proving a theory. Hossenfelder does some critical thinking that she outlines in the book. I understand the politics of science and Hossenfelder put her career on the line by writing this book. If you are interested in science/physics, this is a worthwhile book to read.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is eight hours and forty minutes. Laura Jennings does a good job narrating the book. Jennings is a voice actor and full-time audiobook narrator."

6,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,5,"The universe is unacceptable to physicistsWell back into history, Man has tried to force nature into symmetry. Some of our greatest scientists spent their lives trying to force the solar system and then the universe into spheres, cubes, cones and cylinders. Or to find superpartners for every particle so they fit the (newish) theory of supersymmetry. That it has never worked has deterred no one, it seems. Sabine Hossenfelder is a theoretical physicist whose very job it is to create new theories (and let mathematicians sweat the details). She has admitted defeat. Her book, Lost in Math, is all about the blizzard of theories we all hear about. They have not only remained unproven, they are often unprovable. She quotes colleagues who admit “It is not an exaggeration to say that most of the world’s particle physicists believe that supersymmetry must be true,” because it so elegant and easy to work with. And despite the facts.Hossenfelder says she got into physics because she couldn’t understand people. Physics made sense; people were indecipherable. With no little irony, she wonders if she should get out of physics, because she can’t understand the people. This is a great basis for a book, and Hossenfelder pulls it off with humor, charm, and almost no resorting to math. It makes for a fabulous tale, as she travels the world to meet with the who’s who of physics. She records their near-unanimous dissatisfaction with their field, both because it is not proving beauty wins over ugly, and because ironically, no progress is being made. The book quickly becomes totally informed irreverence from an insider.Physicists have problems with large numbers. First, they can’t justify or even explain them. Second, when you take the inverse of a large number, it is uncomfortably small, which they also can’t justify or explain. The latest disappointment was the long awaited discovery of the Higgs boson, which seems to have disappointed everyone with its ungainly mass. Physicists like numbers to be as close to 1 as possible. They call those numbers “natural” and they lend themselves to pretty theories and formulas. But the universe repeatedly refuses to co-operate in this matter. With all the components and predictions of the current standard model, a total of one qualifies as natural. Everything else is classified as “fine tuning.” Whole theories that utterly fail claim to have discovered “interesting boundaries.” And all with a straight face.The later 20th century found physicists chasing three principles: symmetry, unification, and naturalness. These guiding lights have led them far astray. They have invented numerous unproven theories that are far more elegant than what they observe in nature. They are so elegant, physicists insist that nature must employ them, and their quest becomes to prove nature has done so, not whether or not it is valid. Beauty, Hossenfelder says, is a treacherous guide.In 2018, there remains absolutely no evidence for:-extra dimensions beyond visible 3D and time-new elementary particles beyond the 25 fundamental particles known since the 1960s- vortex theory-string theory-multiverse. Even Stephen Hawking got into it. His posthumously published (second to last) paper explores the beauty of multiverses, though no one has ever been able to demonstrate their existence or influence. Or need, other than for mathematical beauty.Hossenfelder finds some of it comes from sheer boredom. The multibillion dollar Large Hadron Collider has given physicists no new particles or proven any new theories. Physicists are used to rapid advances, dozens yearly, and everyone getting a Nobel Prize sooner than later (most often by age 30 in the 20th century). In the absence of concrete advances, they are trying to fit a cube into a round hole. Or as one string theorist put it – physicists are using a map of the Alps to travel the Himalayas.It has come to the point where anything that isn’t natural and elegant can simply be assigned to another universe, and the job is done. Hossenfelder interviewed one renowned physics professor who complains that physicists now insist their theories need no proof at all, that they should simply be accepted as true, and developed from there. This is precisely why Hossenfelder got into physics; she couldn’t understand people like this. The professor agrees; he is baffled and worried about the whole field.One of the many nice things about Hossenfelder’s style is that she doesn’t begin with 50 pages of dreary history and instruction. She gets right to the issue and only then backpedals into origins. She advises that readers can skip this if they know it. But that would be a mistake. She writes so smartly and her perspective is so untainted by the usual academic constraints, it’s even a pleasure to read the history.She tries to explain the bias that physicists exhibit. But she can’t get past the fact it is about aesthetics and not science. Everyone she speaks with is in favor of it. They admit the pretty theory gains automatic acceptance, while the complicated answer founders. She fears this is precisely why theoretical physics has made no advances in decades. And why she thinks she might be better off leaving it.Truth be told, many of the sciences foster these same viruses. Biology says it is in crisis. I reviewed the excellent Are We Smart Enough To Know How Smart Animals Are? by Frans deWaal, in which he comes down hard on social scientists for their totally prejudiced studies unconsciously designed to prove animals don’t measure up to Man. They are basically all invalid, and Hossenfelder thinks the same thing is going on in theoretical physics.Douglas Adams said that in the whole history of written English, you will never find the combination of words: “as pretty as an airport”. Here’s another I never thought I’d see: a fun theoretical physics book.David Wineberg"
7,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"One of my favourite illustrations from a science title was in Fred Hoyle's book on his quasi-steady state theory. It shows a large flock of geese all following each other, which he likened to the state of theoretical physics. In the very readable Lost in Math, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder exposes the way that in certain areas of physics, this is all too realistic a picture. (Hossenfelder gives Hoyle's cosmological theory short shrift, incidentally, though, to be fair, it wasn't given anywhere near as many opportunities to be patched up to match observations as the current version of big bang with inflation.)Lost in Math is a very powerful analysis of what has gone wrong in the way that some aspects of physics are undertaken. Until the twentieth century, scientists made observations and experiments and theoreticians looked for theories which explained them, which could then be tested against further experiments and observations. Now, particularly in particle physics, it's more the case that physicists dream up whole rafts of theory supported only by mathematics, much of which can never be experimentally confirmed, and what can be checked is often so expensive to work on that only a very small number of possibilities can be examined. It's the maths (if we're talking beauty, I have to confess I find 'math' a very ugly word) that is in the driving seat, which surely is wrong. As Hossenfelder points out, string theory works best if the cosmological constant value that reflects the expansion or contraction of the universe is negative. Unfortunately it's actually positive, but most string theorists spend their time working with a negative cosmological constant. It can make for beautiful mathematics - but has nothing to do with our universe.It's also the case that the vast majority of theoretical advances in physics were made by individuals, where now most theoreticians work in teams - it's tempting to wonder, if a camel is a horse designed by committee, what is a theory developed by group consensus?Hossenfelder repeatedly comes back to two measures used to test theories - beauty, which is inevitably a subjective phenomenon, even though there is some agreement of what is required for beauty - and naturalness, which appears more scientific as it involves numbers, but relies on a bizarre confidence that values in nature that are dimensionless (for example ratios of masses) should be Goldilocks-like in not being too big or two small, but should be around the value of 1. The physicists she speaks to through the book (nearly all male), often seem to cling onto these measures without being able to justify them, other than saying that everyone else likes them too. There are some attempts - one suggests the appeal to beauty is an evolutionary response to a successful theory, but that only shows a weak understanding of evolution (though evolutionary developments can, at least, probably explain the physicists' love of symmetry - and it's not because nature has to be that way, but because we find symmetrical faces attractive).Vast amounts of physicist-hours are being put into theories such as string theory, which seems pretty much incapable of doing the main job it is supposed to (though does have some side benefits), or defending the extension of the standard model of particle physics called supersymmetry, even as more and more evidence suggests it is unlikely to be true. Hossenfelder shows that clinging to theories past their sell-by date is almost inevitable because physicists are people too. If you've spent half your career on a theory, you don't give it up easily, even though scientists are supposed to love falsification. And if hundreds of other people (remember the geese) are working on a particular theory, surely it must have some substance behind it? One thing the book doesn't mention, but may be worth thinking about, is perhaps there are too many theoretical physicists? Hossenfelder points out in a period of about a year when the LHC produced data that looked interesting but turned out to be a statistical fluctuation, 500 papers were published exploring this non-event theoretically, many published in top journals.Relatively briefly, Hossenfelder also examines the aspects of modern academic scientific life that make it hard to give the amount of time to actually working on theory that should be the case, citing estimates of around 40% going to actual work (another 40% going to grant applications). The processes required to get funding also tend to work against original thinking and deviating from the goose flock - there seems little doubt that this structure makes a large negative contribution to the whole business, though no one seems to have an answer to the problem.The only negative I have with the book is that Hossenfelder, like many practising physicists, struggles to explain some of the actual physics in a way that conveys any meaning to the general reader. Luckily, this is not essential here - this is not a book to learn about physics, but about the way modern physicists work. Interestingly, Hossenfelder complains that 'popular science books about special relativity are often full of rocket ships and satellites passing each other. But all of this is unnecessary decoration. Special relativity follows from the three symmetries [she lists] above, without twins in spaceships and laser clocks and all that.' While this is true, the way symmetries are used here is an argument that is near-impossible to follow for a non-mathematician. The twins paradox and light clocks make it much easier for the rest of us to get a grip on the subject (and, to be fair, my undergraduate special relativity textbook makes use of both, so it's not just popular science doing it).Inevitably there will be a widespread negative reaction from the physics community (which has already started) - but this is not surprising when Hossenfelder is attempting to burst a self-reinforcing social bubble just as powerful as those that surround American political parties. The knee-jerk reaction is always to deny there's anything wrong - yet here it seems so obviously a case of the emperor's new clothes. Some readers may take this book to be an anti-science one - but it really isn't. Hossenfelder is merely pointing out a deep problem in some parts of physics, but she in no way undermines the remarkable scientific discoveries that have come from centuries of physics (and applications we benefit from as a result of some of them). Rather, she is saying that people in her profession need to step back from the coalface and take stock of what they are really doing and whether this particular approach really makes sense. True creativity often requires this - but most of us find it difficult to do. And it's about time a physicist said this.Highly recommended (and very brave)."

10,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,5,"It is reassuring to know that there are quite a few people out there not happy with how physics is going these days. Reading, for example, Krauss’ half-assed pompous non-explanation for why there is something instead of nothing, or reading Tegmark’s incoherent ramblings about his mathematical universe as he pats himself on the back for being oh such a crazy maverick, or basically watching the entire string community pat their collective backs so hard they will break each other’s shoulder blades despite having precisely bupkis to show for all their effort except some convoluted math they claim is real dang pretty though it has crap-all to do with the real world and then demand that we loosen up with that pesky scientific method because really what did that old thing ever do for us, and all this when even I, as an at my absolute best enthusiastic amateur can poke holes the size of ocean liners through their reasoning… well, the whole thing starts to look like a rather sad affair.But then people like Hossenfelder come along and reassure me that yes, there are people with the relevant scientific training able to see beyond the blinkered view offered by the mainstream, people able to step back and do real meta-physics, in the sense of having an outside look at what physics is doing and asking some hard questions about where the whole thing is heading. It also helps that she is a pretty good writer with a sharp sense of humor, not afraid to go around asking some pretty big names about those same hard questions, exposing their faulty reasoning and certainty that, yes, generations before us people were pretty silly and thought that if a theory is beautiful and elegant it must be true, and they were wrong, but that totally can’t happen to us, because now we are real smart and our theory now is waaaay too beautiful and elegant, so it must be true.Oh, and the reaction – well, just the butthurt incoherent misogynistic spittle-flinging trumpian response from a certain Professor Motl whose whole point seems to boil down to “what a dumb woman-creature, questioning me and my brilliant buddies who are brilliant because we think we are!” was worth the price of admission and serves as a clear double-thumbs-up recommendation for the book."

The book contains a series of interviews with leading theoretical physicists, where she discusses the role of elegance/beauty/simplicity in theory assessment, but while these discussions are in themselves fascinating—Steve Weinberg's is hilarious—they are often colored by what seems to be a superior, almost patronizing tone, which seems associated with her own lack of tenure/status. More importantly she does a relatively poor job of equipping the lay reader with enough background information to grasp the significance of her critiques. So in the end you are left with a somewhat shallow overview/critique of modern theoretical physics, with little guidance about how things could be done better.3-stars."
12,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"Before all Iwould like guve it six stars.Since the 60s years in the past century ,when the Higgs machanism was proposed and so completed the standard model and the recent Discovery of the Higgs boson in the LHC giving to the standard model the final confirmation,,there has not been any breakthouht in theoretical physics,this is giving way to a great worry and stress in the theoreticl physicists comunity,more as they are in what they name the nightmare scenario,is to say,no new particle,no extradimensions,no new physics is present in the LHC and by that no experimental guidance.This lack of progress has made that some physicists have begun to ask themselves if not there is some wrong in the lines or methods or asumptions that theoretical physics has taken lately and by that some have written a series of books analicing and criticing this subject.Between this books we have :The Trouble with the Physics by Lee Smolin,The end of Physics by David Lindsey,The end of Science by John Morgan,Farewell to Reality by Jim Baggot,Higher Speculations by Kragh,Not even Wrong by Peter Voit and this last Lost in Math by Sabine Hossenfelder.The book of Sabine Hossenfelder is not a usual popular science book,it is a book pointed and devoted to the lay person,to the scientific institutions and to the scientifics themselves,it is a book where she makes a analysis and a critic of the phylosofic,psichologic,sociologic ,organizative and economic features of the to day way of make theoretical phisics research,it is a deep,honest,serious and thouhtprovoking about all this subjects,is a dense book,not to be read in a day.She travel and interview a series of theorists as Steven Weinberg,Garret Lisi,Joe Polchinsky and others about the last guides in the theoretical research that basically are : beauty,naturalness and simplicity .After all this in the and she thinks that this asumptions or principles that were good gudes in the past it is posible could be wrong in the future as the nature could in the Deep be ugly,unnatural or complex and that first properties be emergent.As the title says too much search for beauty could lead physics to be lost in maths,in untestable,unfalsifiable models.Sabine draws three lessons that I textually transcrib:""""First,if you want to solve a problema with math first make sure there is really a problem.Second,state your asumptions,naturalness is such an asumption and so is simplicity.Third,obsrvational gudance is nsccesary""""""Physics isnt math.Its chosing the right math.""With regard to the sociologic,psichologic economic problems she points to:More colaboration:Less single authored papers.Less time:academic researchers spend only about of the 40 percent of their time in research.Less long term funding:grat increase in the percentage of researchers non tenured and part time.Less heterogenity:this means that academics all over the globe now march to the same drum.And she gives some adwices of what we can do.As a scientist:learn about social and cognitive biases,prevent social and cognitive biases,beware the influence of media and social networks,build a culture of criticism,say no.As a science policy maker,journal editor or representative of a funding body:do your own thing,use clear gudelines,make commitments,encourage a change of field,hire full time reviewers,support the publication of criticism and negative results,offer courses on social and cognitive biases,allow a división of labour by specialization in task.As a science writer or a member of the public :ask questions.Of course the book is much more tan this and give a lot of information on competing final theories.and it has many times a touch of sparky acid humor.A fundamental book to know what is going on in this critical time in the theoretical physics."

There are a lot of physical theories and hypotheses. At the same time, the experiments are very expensive. So it should be some benchmark that play role in the selection process. It is far from the obvious, but apparently the main criteria that define which perspective physical theories are to be tested are ... beauty, elegance and simplicity. How much I wish it would work smoothly! But the main message of the book is that the application of those criteria in spite of being very attractive, has lead the modern physics into very difficult situation.The whole premise is extremely fascinating. But exploring this, the author touches upon quite solid array of topics from the modern physics to the philosophy of science and even the economics of research. And she is doing it in a beautiful, elegant and simple manner (not pan intended or is it?)."
14,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,4,"There’s a phrase the author Sabine Hossenfelder uses throughout the book that I found initially mystifying: “Physics isn’t math.”I found the phrase mystifying not because I didn’t understand its meaning but because I didn’t understand its point. It’d be like my writing, “Poetry isn’t English.” Of course it isn’t. English may be the language with which poetry is crafted, but they are not equivalent. Same relationship between math and physics. But so what?The ""Poetry isn't English"" analogy helped me understand her point - and why this book's quest ultimately fails - because I immediately thought of the poem, ""The Jabberwocky."" It's one of my favorites. During university, I would sneak out at night and graffiti lines of the poem all around campus. I would only scrawl a few of the lines, but I would return later to the scene of my crime and be delighted to discover other vandals had completed the rest!Anyhow, ""The Jabberwocky"" proves this point that Poetry Isn't English because only half the words even are English. The poem describes the Bandersnatch as ""frumious,"" a delightful portmanteau of ""furious"" and ""fuming."" But other words aren't even combinations! They're just made-up, like the hero's ""vorpal"" sword.And yet, despite all these made-up words, the poem itself isn't particularly difficult to understand. When I read the first two lines, “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,” I imagine this dense virgin jungle, pierced by shafts of brilliant sunlight, filled with exotic beasts rooting about. When I read of the hero who ""took his vorpal sword in hand; / Long time the manxome foe he sought,"" I picture this armored hero, shining black blade in hand, stalking through the jungle, hunting for the Jabberwocky, a cockatrice-type beast. And so on and so forth.It's clear ""The Jabberwocky"" isn’t JUST its language, but rather what that language refers back to. Without that referent, it truly would be nonsense - and so would all poetry and indeed most language.That’s what Hossenfelder means when she says, “Physics isn’t math.” The math of physics is supposed to refer back to some underlying physical reality. If it doesn’t - or if it's not possible to determine whether it does - then it’s not really physics, is it? It’s just math.So the title Lost in Math refers to her worry that the math of modern theoretical physics has lost that connection with an underlying physical reality, that we’ve entered a “post-empirical” - dare I say post-physical? - era of physics. While this has both philosophical and psychological ramifications, her concern is primarily pragmatic. Because experiments grow more costly, while the number of theories is blooming, we’re faced with a daunting conundrum: how do we decide which theories to test and therefore which experiments to run?Consider the Large Hadron Collider, for example. This project cost over $5bn and, aside from the confirmation of the Higgs boson, has mostly yielded null results. Various commentators look at that price-tag and go, ""Wow! That’s a lot of money to spend on something with so little return.” But that’s really missing the point. Sure, $5bn is no small chunk of change, but it’s not like CERN burned that money. It went to the labs and engineering and construction firms who designed and built it. The money circulated back into the economy. When you’re talking macro-economics, the TRUE cost is opportunity cost. Because they were working on the LHC, all those scientists and engineers weren’t working on designing and running different experiments, ones that might’ve yielded more fruit.So this question of choosing which experiments to run and which theories to test is a serious one and one with, arguably, a time limit, in the sense that we need new and improved science to combat existential threats like climate change and meteor strikes.So how do we decide which theories to test? That’s where the book’s sub-title comes in: “How beauty leads physics astray.”Hossenfelder contends - and this is thoroughly confirmed throughout the many interviews she undertakes - that modern theoretical physicists use aesthetic and sociological considerations (i.e. ""beauty"") to decide which theories are good and which are bad, and therefore which experiments to run. Unfortunately, this definition of ""beauty"" is outdated, because it's rooted in human experience even though advances in fundamental physics must now occur in realms decidedly outside of human experience (at quantum and galactic scales).Thus, Lost in Math: How Beauty leads Physics Astray is most accurately summarized as Hossenfelder’s personal quest to, first, discover the current definition of ""beauty"" in theoretical physics; second, to probe why physicists think nature will obey such aesthetic considerations; and, third, to explore alternative approaches. I wrote earlier that she fails this quest, and I’m about to explain why, but I first want to emphasize that this failure is in no way a criticism of the book. On the contrary, it is the quest's abject failure that suggests its importance.By failure, I mean we never get a clear explanation of why top theoretical physicists believe that nature should obey human aesthetic concerns, nor even much of an admission that there's something rotten about such an assumption. Even physicists who explicitly concede the subjective, arbitrary nature of aesthetic standards nevertheless consistently revert to words like ugly and attractive to describe various theories. Further, I consider the quest a failure because we never get much of a sense of how we'd go about fixing this mess, not in any practical way. Hossenfelder's prescription essentially amounts to a section in which she completely shits on philosophers. She calls them ""useless"", which made me laugh, since it reminded me of my teenage math students claiming math is ""useless."" They, like Hossenfelder, entirely miss the point that the study of math - and the study of philosophy - is like Cross-fit for the mind: it makes you better at everything else you do. Nevertheless, despite trashing philosophers, Hossenfelder then goes on to suggest that philosophy of science needs to play a bigger role in science. *sigh*That's her first major suggestion. Her second is that physicists need to be more mindful of cognitive biases and sociological influences. *second sigh*That's like if I went to a doctor because I was having persistent headaches and he said, ""Well, I think you should probably try to live a healthier life."" Gee, thanks Doc.But if you’d told me the nature of this quest and the means by which Hoessenfelder explores it (interviewing prominent physicists), I could have told you it was going to fail in these ways without even reading the book.The most obvious issue is that this question of the aesthetics of physical theories isn’t a question of physics but of metaphysics. As I already wrote, it’s an utterly important question for physicists… but they simply aren’t equipped with the tools to answer it. When it comes to physicists, the author's disdain for philosophy is the norm, not the exception. Stephen Hawking famously wrote ""philosophy is dead.""As someone who studies both physics and philosophy, I consider this disdain to be incredibly foolish - and Einstein would have agreed with me. Scratch that. Einstein DID agree with me. He himself (rather less famously) credited his reading of philosopher David Hume with his development of relativity.But that’s the reality: Your average physicist knows jack shit about philosophy. So it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that when Hossenfelder went around the world and asked physicists a question of philosophy, they were incapable of answering it.The more subtle, deeper issue is that she’s coming up against the constraints of human beings. By the end of the book, it becomes obvious that the various physicists' references to the ""beauty"" or ""ugliness"" of a theory were shorthand for gut instinct and intuition. Or, more precisely, subconscious assessment.Human beings tend to pride themselves on their possession of consciousness, but modern psychology and neuroscience have correctly marked human beings as largely creatures of the subconscious. This is nowhere more obvious than language. Consider uttering the phrase, “I am reading a book review.” That phrase, even simple as it is, is essentially entirely constructed in your subconscious. What would would it look like if it were consciously constructed?First, you’d have to explicitly, consciously consider what pronoun to use: “I” or “me” or even “you"" or ""he."" My experience is that most people don't actually know the explicit difference (subjective vs objective pronoun case) between “I” and “me,"" so right away they wouldn’t be able to answer why they’re uttering “I am reading” instead of “Me am reading” (except that it “sounds wrong,” an admission that their subconscious chose the pronoun). Then you’d have to decide what verb to use: “am looking at"" the book review? ""am understanding"" the book review? ""am consuming"" the book review?! Okay no, for non-blind humans, looking at written language with our sense of vision in order to understand is referred to as ""reading."" But then why is it ""I am reading"" instead of simply ""I read""? And so on and so forth.Nobody does this. If they did, they’d speak as slowly as Ents.No human can escape the domination of the subconscious. Certainly not physicists. It would be impossible for them to pursue theory-crafting and theory-assessment without relying on their subconscious, which is essentially the storehouse of all their physics know-how.This whole line of reasoning imbues the entire book with an accidental comedic air, as the author keeps asking these physicists to explain, “Why is this theory more beautiful than this other theory?” The question, understood in terms of consciousness, becomes, “Consciously summarize, in a couple of sentences, the subconscious sum total of your life’s experience with physics.”Not really gonna happen, is it? And indeed it does not, in much the same way that many people can read ""The Jabberwocky"" and develop a remarkably rich interpretation of it, without having the slightest clue what a portmanteau is.But I wouldn’t hold that against the book. I've focused on its core thesis, but it's also just a really good exploration of current problems and mysteries with theoretical/foundational physics, as well as an insider’s look into the culture surrounding those who work on said problems. It's all quite fascinating. I read the whole thing while I suffered from an ear/sinus infection, and it did remarkably well in taking my mind off the pain of my face trying to explode. Which, if you ask me, would make for a most excellent promotional blurb to have on your book jacket."
15,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I honestly don't know how to rate this book. Some arguments were extremely worthwhile and needed a voice. In regard to those arguments, Hossenfelder's voice was razor sharp, clear, unafraid, questioning, critical, and informative. Other times though, it really felt as if she overshot -- a lot, which muddied the waters for her better arguments. Prior to this book, I watched talks given by Hossenfelder in which she picked apart my heroes. She criticized them for being guided by beauty. Watching her tear apart the arguments of these men who I pretty much worship was shocking but very satisfying. I love having my beliefs challenged. So, Hossenfelder's work was appealing to me, even when she went after my idol Dirac. But, in . my opinion, this book takes the ""beauty is not a good guide"" argument too far. I feel unsettled. I also feel less informed that Hossenfelder about many aspects of physics, which made it even more difficult to rate this book. Is the LHC worth the money since SUSY has not made an appearance? I don't know. It's a concern, and one worth discussing. After all, it's a lot of money. But are all discussions of the multiverse bad science? I think suggesting so goes too far. You can imagine that our tools will only get better and better. Our ability to explain the universe in equations will only get better. Is Everett's Many Worlds the only way to understand our universe? Probably not. Prior to Everett, we could not have conceived of equations that suggest every possibility is real instead of the wave function collapse. It's extremely valuable to keep thinking about bubble universes, warped spacetime, the arrow of time, and other ideas that lead us to think about a multiverse. It seems extremely defeatist to think researchers should not suggest ideas that are untestable. How many testable hypotheses came into existence because people continued to wonder about things that were not testable? In thinking about the untestable, we might come up with certain aspects of the untestable situation that we *can* test. I just feel like we should fight against people who turn physics into pseudoscience (the laws of attraction, crystal healing, etc) and stop trying to inhibit people who are trying to answer the big questions. Question their methods, their logic, and their findings. Science needs that. This book seems to go beyond that."
16,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65973916-gridgirl,3," “There are other reasons we use math in physics. […] The main reason we use math in physics, however, is because we can.”This was probably the most demanding non-fiction book that I have ever read in my free time. I personally don’t think that anyone who is not a scientist would much benefit from it, even though the author clearly had the non-professionals included in her target group when she wrote the book, because a lot of trivial things are explained. On the other hand, though, she also touched on topics that even physics students only hear about in their third or maybe fourth year. I think she tried to make this book as accessible for the amateur as other popular science books, but it didn’t really work out and I don’t even know if ‘normal people’ care about this topic at all.On the positive side: If you are in the field of (theoretical) physics, you will probably have a good laugh while reading this. Sabine Hossenfelder is incredibly funny and I have sticky notes all over the book with my favorite quotes. This is one of the most amusing non-fiction books that I have ever read and that helps with the challenging topics. Kudos to the author for that accomplishment and that is the reason why I would definitely pick up other books by her.Now on to my main issue with the book: Sabine Hossenfelder advocates the hypothesis that modern theoretical physicists are not following the best scientific practices, because they mainly focus on beauty when developing their own and evaluating other’s theories. She’s investigating this theory through interviewing other physicists in the field, who mainly don’t share her opinion, and disproving their stance. Here is something that struck my mind at the halfway point of the book:
I just realized, that she didn’t talk to these people she interviewed because she truly wanted to know whether beauty is a justified measure for the validity of a theory. She talked to them with the intention write a book about all the reasons why they are wrong. I don’t think anything they could have said would have made her change her opinion on the matter. And by that, is she not ignoring the scientific method herself?
I still stand by this at the end of the book and it’s a huge issue for me.What accompanies this problem is that she does not present any solutions. She rambles on about how physicists do not do their work properly, but she offers no approachable steps that I as a physics student could take to move towards more meaningful theories that we can actually test and benefit from. And the fact that she forgot to add advice for (aspiring) physicists downgrades her book from “constructive criticism” to “ranting”.3/5"
17,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"A good read after Adam Becker's What is Real, and for anyone who might have watched that giddy, over-earnest documentary, Particle Fever about the LHC and CERN and wondered what happened after the Higgs was found .... well: they are still waiting, and as the physics world waits, sitting in their ideological camps (supersymmetry, string theory, etc.), some physicists are entrenching themselves in the theories to which they have devoted their careers, even when there is no evidence. While others are beginning to panic (seeing the ""nightmare scenario"" in the lack of evidence) and then reach for unscientific explanations that fit their imagined aesthetic criteria (i.e., it must be beautiful) - perhaps even abandoning the scientific method in the process. But a few contrarians, like Hossenfelder, are daring to suggest that we are being misled by our human ideas of beauty and elegance. Maybe we need to back up and rethink it all sooner rather than later.....I hadn't realized that physics was in such a state of crisis.The book is a little disorienting to read because it's a combo of approaches (part overview of the subject, part personal chronicle, part polemic). If Hossenfelder was trying to write a Janna Levin-type book then she was not successful - Hossenfelder is a little surly and angsty, often blunt in her tone, so she is not as convivial a guide as Janna Levin (in Black Hole Blues, for example). But Hossenfelder seems to be truly upset and also fearless in indicting her colleagues , while at the same time willing to question herself and her motivations for being so contrarian:Maybe I'm just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I'm disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with -- blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method. I'm glad I read this. The book is a bit rough-going in the middle chapters for a non-physicist (me), but the final chapters re-summarize the arguments and are quite interesting (esp. an exploration of biases). Hossenfelder made me reconsider a lot of assumptions I had."

TL;DR
Lost in Math by Sabine Hossenfelder is an important investigation into the current biases shared across the theoretical physics discipline. It asks hard questions about the current orthodoxy. Highly recommended.

Review
One thought experiment that I love is the Theseus Paradox, which asks the question that if a ship is repaired and all of its old parts replaced, is it the same ship that was originally built or a new one? When looking at modern theoretical physics, I start to wonder if we’re approaching a similar paradox where physics has been replaced by math and philosophy. In Lost in Math, Sabine Hossenfelder seeks to answer a similar question. Her contention is that desire for a beautiful theorem has become too much of a distraction for theoretical physics. Lost in Math journals her investigation.
The State of Theoretical Physics
Ms. Hossenfelder quite clearly lays out the state of theoretical physics, and she approaches the field as a contrarian. In my idealized view of any science, I see the practitioners as deeply skeptical of the status quo. Else how do we surpass our current knowledge? But Ms. Hossenfelder paints a different picture, one in which questioning the mainstream is increasingly difficult. In Lost in Math, she focuses on the failure to find supersymmetric particles to explore whether we’re looking at the wrong theory, simply because symmetry is beautiful. She investigates this through many interviews with working and prominent physicists. Her journey showed a variation of opinion but a united optimism that the scientific method will prevail. It’s encouraging to see that despite the lack of results, the physicists maintain their excitement and passion for their field. But passion isn’t enough when the experimental results are missing. Ms. Hossenfelder continues to hammer home the point that despite bigger and bigger particle colliders, the supersymmetric particles still elude us.In the course of her investigation, we see that she’s at odds with the mainstream physics community. In this book, she lays out many reasons for why this is so, and I appreciated that she presents a complex picture. Because, like many things in life, no one prime mover exists that we can point to and say, “fix that to make everything better.” But in addition to shining the spotlight on what she believes to be the problem, Ms. Hossenfelder lists potential solutions. These solutions are the appendix, which, at first, I didn’t like. It seemed too safe to exclude them from the text, but upon reflection, I think it was the correct move to place them in the appendix. Instead of highlighting her solutions, Ms. Hossenfelder showcased the problem, which allows room for solutions other than just her own. Though, I recommend serious consideration of her solutions.The most technical argument in the book pits natural versus fine-tuning. It’s an interesting discussion that takes a bit to understand, but I think Ms. Hossenfelder explains it well. It’s challenging without reaching too far.
Writing
This text is a curious mixture of physics lessons, interviews, and travel journal. Sabine writes in an academic style that at times slips into deep philosophical prose. While most of the book was accessible for me, often I had to reread and think hard about the concepts in the text. The challenging parts are important in a book like this. The reader needs to think deeply about the topics and where physics goes from here. But these parts are interspersed enough to give the book a sense of pacing. Lost in Math wasn’t a dull, dry lecture; it’s a story of the current state of physics that ebbs and flows. I think it’s very well done and will be looking for more of Ms. Hossenfelder’s work.In addition to the physics lessons, this book reads as a person questioning if they’re still in love with their profession. One of the important but rarely discussed differences between college and the workforce is what the work actually entails. The things I loved about studying engineering make up less than half of what I do at my job. What we study and love is just a small part of work, and I wonder if this book is born of Ms. Hossenfelder’s disappointment in that regard. By the close of the book, we see that its her love of physics that clashes with the current orthodoxy. The contrarian occupies a difficult place in a society, especially when pointing out needed improvements. So, is it that Ms. Hossenfelder is questioning her career choice, or does she feel the fatigue of pointing out that the emperor has no clothes? I hope it’s the latter and that she continues to provide a reality check to theoretical physics if not to spur on needed changes.
Physics (My Personal Opinion)
No one would accuse me of being without an opinion, and I try to keep them out of my reviews. BUT around this book gathered many questions that I’ve had over the years about physics. To be clear, I love physics. I read a lot about the field and came close to making it my career path. But ultimately I chose engineering for a number of reasons, high among them the need to see a testable product. Over the years of reading about string theory, the standard model, the multi-verse, I’ve fallen in love with these elegant ideas, but a small tickle always accompanied my studies. How do they know these advanced theories are correct? That is the question that drove Lost in Math and that drove me to engineering. Traditionally, the answer to that question has been an experimental correlation. Theory and experiment twist round each other like the double helix of a DNA strand. But increasingly, physics has branched out into areas currently beyond our experimental capabilities. So, the question becomes how do they know?But at some point we have to say that we don’t know. There is nothing wrong with this, though. Being able to say I don’t know is an essential part of the scientific method, but it isn’t as sexy as talking about the multi-verse or a reality made from music. One day, it may be possible to conduct experiments into the information loss paradox at blackhole event horizons. One day, we might be able to glimpse into the multi-verse to view inflationary bubbles where everything is made of anti-matter. But until then we must be careful to differentiate between what we believe and what we’ve observed. This is even more true when put in context of the anti-science right here in America. These people condemn the word theory when applied to evolution, and it’s hard to explain that theory doesn’t just mean guess. And when theory is all mathematical, it’s even more difficult. 
Conclusion
Sabine Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math is a call to action for physics to take a good hard look at itself. It’s a necessary work that will irritate people, which is ultimately the role of a contrarian who loves a subject. Ms. Hossenfelder’s attempts to pull physics back from the borders of pure math and philosophy is admirable. As an anchor to the current realities of the field, this is a must have book for anyone exploring cutting edge theoretical physics.

19,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Is truth beauty and beauty, truth? It can be hard to tell.In Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray, Sabine Hossenfelder argues that these two concepts are not equivalent. As the subtitle implies, Hossenfelder feels that theoretical physicists are too obsessed with creating “beautiful” theories, in the sense that the mathematics that underpins the theories (because these days, theories are basically math, even though, as Hossenfelder stresses, physics isn’t math) must be beautiful and use “natural” numbers (by which she means numbers close to 1). Theories that don’t conform to these criteria tend to be unpopular, to receive less funding for experiments and less attention in papers. This, Hossenfelder contends, is a mistake. She fears it reinforces an orthodoxy that threatens theoretical physics with stagnation and, worse, undermines the scientific method. In her view, since theoretical physics is often regarded as the “hardest” of hard sciences, if faith in the foundations of physics goes, so too goes trust in science—right when we need it more than ever.I guess this book kind of hits the sweet spot for me, because I’m big into the intersections of philosophy and mathematics and science. Thanks to NetGalley and Basic Books for the free eARC!I love thinking about the limits not just of what we know but also what is knowable. This, to me, is why theoretical physics fascinates me—not just because it explains the foundations of our physical existence, but because it knocks up against literally the limits of our ability to measure and quantify. Each time we want to go looking for heavier and heavier particles, for example, we need bigger and bigger particle accelerators. That’s why we built the LHC, which—in Hossenfelder’s opinion—has been a bit of a bust in terms of new physics. But we’re running up against the limits of what we can do on Earth, or even in orbit … what’s next? Particle accelerators the size of our solar system? I get chills.Lost in Math is not really about physics in the popular science sense. This is more accurately a philosophy book. Hossenfelder discusses a lot of physics concepts (most of which, to be honest, go way over my head), but ultimately she is more interested in looking at why her colleagues in theoretical physics chase the theories that they do. Unlike some of them, she confesses that she doesn’t seem to have a nose for beauty, that she doesn’t recognize a beautiful theory when she sees it—and she is uneasy about this reliance on ideas of beauty.So while the book follows the fairly standard approach in popular science texts of doing a brief overview of the history of physics, Hossenfelder is looking at the philosophies that were at work rather than the merits of the actual theories. As familiar names—Bohr and Einstein and Schrodinger and Heisenberg and Dirac et al—move across the page, we learn more about their thinking—insofar as we can know it—than their specific contributions. Hossenfelder isn’t looking to teach physics here. She’s asking us to think critically about why we have the physics we do.I think this is a really interesting and important point. To laypeople, like myself, it might seem inevitable that we’ve ended up here. After all, there is only one true science, right? We might have made a bunch of false starts, but along the way, as we uncover more and more “facts” and tinker with our theories and run better experiments, we’re narrowing it down and getting closer to “the truth”, right?Well … it’s complicated. As Hossenfelder explains, it isn’t so much that the physics we have now is The One True Physics as it is Something That Mostly Works. And in the case of quantum physics, there are actually a whole bunch of competing interpretations that explain the same phenomena, just differently, and at the moment they all tend to be valid because no one has figured out a way to test between them. So as much as both philosophers and physicists would like the other camp to stay out of their business, when you get right down to it, the two are entwined at the moment.Hossenfelder tours the landscape of theoretical physics, interviewing researchers in different fields to help her understand the obsession with naturalness and beauty. Along the way, you will pick up on her clear sense of exasperation with what’s happening in her profession. It isn’t just the naturalness argument: it’s the whole system, the fighting over short-term grants and positions, the tendency to reward people who publish more often, on more accepted topics, over people who spend their time tinkering with more heterodox approaches. And maybe how surprised I am by Hossenfelder’s tone and voice, or even the fact that this book got written, further supports this idea, since we are so used to “gee whiz” pop physics books that emphasize the beauty of the universe and of the theories that explain it. Physicists who write books for popular consumption are generally trying to build a following, and I get the impression Hossenfelder really doesn’t care about that. While I find Hossenfelder’s writing, in general, to be mediocre, her forthright and honest tone is refreshing and interesting.There’s a fair bit of mathematical concepts in this book too. That probably shouldn’t be surprising, given its title. There aren’t actual equations, but Hossenfelder throws around terms like “groups” fairly generously without really going into what they are (and maybe that’s for the best). As with the physics shop talk, if you don’t have much of a grounding in abstract algebra, you’re going to feel a little out of the loop. This is not a light read. It is, however, enjoyable in the sense that it tickles the part of your brain that really wants to think hard about things.Lost in Math succeeds, largely, in what it sets out to do. It demonstrates that certain elements of how theoretical physicists theorize right now aren’t the most conducive or productive. It pulls back the curtain for a wider audience, exposing us to some of the philosophical debates and issues that have long been happening within the physics community, which laypeople might wrongly perceive as monolithic in approach, if not in interpretations. Hossenfelder’s writing is a little dry, and the book is full of challenging concepts … but I think it’s worth a try if you want some philosophy in with your science.

21,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16200898-jeremy,5,"Note: I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley.This was a great book, and one I hope that many people (particularly within physics) choose to read. It's not the most uplifting book, but that's the point. I'm a student within physics, and I'm happy that someone is at least shedding some light on the less appealing aspects of physics at this time. It's great to be hopeful, but if everyone is sharing the same mass delusion about supersymmetry and beauty when there is no experimental evidence for it, that's not so good.I particularly like the fact that the author brings up the fact of a probability distribution. If one doesn't have a probability distribution, you cannot quantify how ""improbable"" it is for two numbers to cancel out so well (fine-tuning). It's just not possible. Yet, it seems like physicists are doing this over and over again, without recognizing they are choosing a probability distribution arbitrarily.The author's views on beauty within physics is also nice to hear. It's fine to say that beauty has been an okay guide in the past, but there's no reason for us to think it's the only guide, or needs to be correct. This has implications, since it affects what kind of experiments are funded (to a certain extent). As such, it's important to acknowledge that we are enchanted by beauty, and this isn't a mathematical necessity.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. I already follow the author's blog, Backreaction, and it's great as well. Read this book. It's important."
22,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75684652-venla,5,"Lost in Math is a great and well written summary about the way physics is represented in the modern days. The writer Sabine Hossenfelder is a theoretical physicist whose job is to create new theories and leave the mathematical stuff to the mathematicians. In her book Hossenfelder talks about what has gone wrong with her subject in the last thirty years or so.Now, especially in particle physics, the whole concept kind of circles around made up theories that are only supported by mathematicians. There are not much to observe or experiment on when almost the whole subject is theoretical and not proven in any way. Right now the big thing in particle physics is The Large Hadron Collider which is still yet to be as great of a device as it was promised to be. Hossenfelder goes through these kind of subjects as well as talks about her own experiences in her field and why she eventually took up physics in the first place. I've been struggling with physics my self for a quite long time in school but still I genuinely enjoyed this books. It kind of made me more interested in the subject and gave me some motivation to tackle down the physics course that I'm currently taking.Lost in Math was a great summary of the current state of physics and the fact that mathematical beauty has kind of taken control over the fundamentals of physics. Hossenfelder does not leave any stone unturned and goes through many problems that the field is currently facing. It is an eye-opening book and also, makes us rethink our own views."
23,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4051067-abhishek-kona,2,I could not finish this book. The overall points in the book make sense to me. Physicists are looking for elegant theories to prove the real world instead of working backwards from the data. This is a problem as it causes us to design expensive experiments in non empirical way. The community has started to rely on elegance as a guiding principle. But I am convinced there is not about 200 pages worth of stuff to be written about the topic. This book could have a 1000 word article. The author is understandably quite cynical about the physics academia. But this leaks into the book and makes it a depressing read.

Physicists are hooked on various definitions of simplicity, involving fewer mathematical terms and especially fewer ""magic constants"" or ""voodoo constants"" (as we would call them computer systems).The author is having deep existential doubts about how physics will peel back the next layer of reality. Many modern theories not only are not currently being tested, but *cannot* be tested, some because they would involve, oh, say, more energy than the Sun puts out, some because they literally are theories about things that don't impact our own physical universe at all, such as the multiverse.It's not an especially long book, and it is well written, but it took me a little bit of time to get through this, since I kept stopping to think, or to look stuff up. A somewhat different perspective than Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, which has some of the same concerns. The author treks the planet to interview some of the world's foremost theoreticians, including Joe Polchinski, who was ill when she spoke to him and died of brain cancer before the book was published, but apparently after it was completed.This gave me quite a bit of food for thought, in my own current mood of thinking about what really matters in life, research and education."

The chapter headings had me in tears with laughter and I constantly kept reading snippets out loud to my less physics-drama inclined partner, which would then require an intense explanation of the history of the field (no pun intended), which then, of course, would cause the whole thing to cease to be funny, and left him with a ""cool story bro"" look on his face while I was still red-faced and cracking up.Oh and also it gives me another chance to post this wonderful xkcd: I know I read a lot of popsci books and recommend a lot of them, but this was one for the ages.

If they know the deficiencies in their beliefs, they rarely acknowledge them as such. Examples:- When I hit the vendor floor space at a computer security conference, no vendor will tell me the shortcomings in their systems; I have to ask competing vendors to find out those shortcomings.- The churches I grew up in never mentioned the weaknesses in their theology -- I had to read books hostile to my faith to understand my faith more completely.That's why I really enjoyed this book. Who better than this author, a disillusioned physicist who's desperate for scientific truth (and her unwillingness to settle for anything less), to point out the failings in contemporary physics research? This is not a complete view of the current state of physics of course, but it's a view that helps complete the many one-sided treatments out there."
29,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,5,"Finished the whole book. I am very satisfied with the content of the book and the clarity in which they are presented. Of course the fact that many ideas agreed with what I have been thinking about may very well be a simple confirmation bias, but it is worth knowing that research in fundamental physics has ""problems"", both theoretical, experimental and sociological.If there is something one must take away from this book, it is Appendix C: what can we do to help solve the problems faced by the field, depending on your position in the world (scientists? laymen? administrator?). I have always thought that academia is a ""broken"" system, which is why so many brilliant minds quit for better future (yes, because for many of us physics is not our entire life). Note that despite my opinion, I don't think the book makes academia look so bad it's not worth entering; the author's objective is more of bringing awareness and hoping that the working scientists don't propagate problematic practices.Overall, the book confirmed and clarified many issues I felt is facing theoretical physics today, my own field included, and yet it still conveys a thin but observable optimism that we can overcome some of these problems at least in the near term, *if* we try. Most importantly, our effort is pointless at individual level due to power dynamics at play. The whole system has to move even if by a little; a large individual move won't change anything.The book might have made me more pessimistic about the field I am working with, but I think it is pointless to go down this route if I am not aware that these problems exist. It is a worthwhile reading despite your busy schedule."
30,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
31,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
32,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
33,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
34,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
35,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
36,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
37,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
38,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
39,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
40,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

43,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

The idea of the book was interesting, but I just felt like the points I did get were too repetitive. There was also this weird gossip-y vibe about physicists. Maybe if I were more aware of their works I would have enjoyed it but I'm not and I didn't."
47,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73759826-jo,4,Sabine shares her experience with physics and math inside a chaotic world where beauty can bright up. She brings a fresh and new perspective to classic theories. This book is a most for new science students. It will encourage them to explore unconventional and innovative paths.
48,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
49,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
50,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
51,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
52,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
53,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
54,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
55,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
57,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
58,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
59,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
60,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
61,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
62,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
63,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
64,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
65,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
66,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
67,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
68,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
69,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
70,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

73,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

78,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
79,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
80,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe.

It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
82,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
83,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
84,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
85,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
87,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
88,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
89,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
90,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
91,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
92,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
93,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
94,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
95,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
96,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
97,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
98,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
99,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
100,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

103,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

108,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
109,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
110,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
111,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
112,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
113,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
114,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
115,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
117,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
118,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
119,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
120,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
121,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
122,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
123,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
124,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
125,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.

Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
128,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
129,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
130,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

133,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

The idea of the book was interesting, but I just felt like the points I did get were too repetitive. There was also this weird gossip-y vibe about physicists. Maybe if I were more aware of their works I would have enjoyed it but I'm not and I didn't."

138,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
139,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
140,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
141,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
142,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"

Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
144,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
145,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
147,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
148,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
149,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
150,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
151,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
152,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
153,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
154,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
155,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
156,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
157,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
158,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."

And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
160,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

163,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

The idea of the book was interesting, but I just felt like the points I did get were too repetitive. There was also this weird gossip-y vibe about physicists. Maybe if I were more aware of their works I would have enjoyed it but I'm not and I didn't."
167,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73759826-jo,4,Sabine shares her experience with physics and math inside a chaotic world where beauty can bright up.

168,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
169,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
170,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
171,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
172,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
173,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
174,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
175,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
177,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
178,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
179,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
180,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
181,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
182,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
183,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
184,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
185,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
186,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
187,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
188,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
189,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
190,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers.

199,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
200,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
201,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
202,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
203,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
204,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
205,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
207,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
208,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
209,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
210,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
211,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."

Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
213,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
214,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
215,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
216,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
217,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
218,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
219,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
220,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

223,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

228,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
229,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
230,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"

It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
232,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"

There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
234,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
235,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
237,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
238,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
239,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
240,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
241,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
242,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"

I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
244,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
245,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
246,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
247,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
248,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
249,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
250,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

252,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41911492-isabelle-leo,4,"Tear it up, Sabine!!!!"
253,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "
254,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11290063-cole,5,Sabine Hossenfelder is the most kindred of scientific spirits.
255,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14671945-kian,5,Exceptionally good!
256,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10176548-sydney,1,"This rating is more a reflection upon myself than the book. The idea of the book was interesting, but I just felt like the points I did get were too repetitive. There was also this weird gossip-y vibe about physicists. Maybe if I were more aware of their works I would have enjoyed it but I'm not and I didn't."
257,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73759826-jo,4,Sabine shares her experience with physics and math inside a chaotic world where beauty can bright up. She brings a fresh and new perspective to classic theories. This book is a most for new science students. It will encourage them to explore unconventional and innovative paths.
258,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
259,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
260,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
261,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
262,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"
263,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038192-jacob-vorstrup-goldman,5,"This possibly concludes a slight detour into physics on my part. Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
264,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
265,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"
267,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3885717-mike,4,"As an experimental particle physicist and someone who has taught quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, I am familiar with many of topics discussed in this book, so I am never sure how the average reader will follow it. Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
268,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
269,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
270,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,4,"This is a book about critical thinking. The author focuses on certain areas of theoretical physics, which is her specialty. However, she also extends the analysis to other fields, most notably to contemporary academic economics, which she clams is in even worse shape from a rational perspective than her own field (pp. 224-26). The last chapter catalogs (pp. 230-31) some of the fallacies Hossenfelder elaborates throughout her book: confirmation bias, motivated cognition, the sunk cost fallacy, in-group bias, shared information bias, apophenia (finding patterns in noise), belief bias, halo effect, false consensus effect, attentional bias (mere exposure effect), communal reinforcement (turning “scientific communities into echo chambers in which researchers repeat their arguments back to each other over and over again, constantly reassuring themselves they're doing the right thing”), and ""the mother of all biases, the bias blind spot—the insistence that we certainly are not biased.” Appendix C identifies concrete steps that the academic community and others can take to remedy these errors in critical thinking. I am not a physicist, and the detailed physics discussions in this book are over my head. However, the book is worth reading even for a nonscientist, because it explains how fallacious thinking can affect even the most ethereal realms of academia. The lessons can be applied not only to theoretical physics but also to other academic fields and, indeed, to all aspects of human thought."
271,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"This is one of the best physics books that I have read in a while. It is in the heart of my Goldilocks range, not too hard and not too easy. And I really liked the author's point of view. She talks about the lack of progress in basic physics in the last 30 to 40 years, and she does her bit of string theory bashing, but she does so in an even handed way and acknowledges that string theory and multiverses may even be right and that we may find meaningful ways to test them with experiments, even if it is never possible to do so directly. Clearly she favors some theories over others, but she acknowledges that a part of the basic idea of theoretical physics is to use math, intuition and imagination to come up with plausible explanations. And she is willing to give a fair hearing to all plausible explanations, even if she does not find them attractive.In the end, the real point of the book is that the ideas of naturalness, simplicity, elegance and beauty that draw physicists and that drive so much of theory are ultimately philosophical choices that may or may not be right in a given case so that caution should be used in selecting them as guidelines for developing new theories, and that there are inevitable psychological biases that affect even the smartest of us and that have sometimes lead theoretical physics down pathways that have not been productive. Her prescriptions in the end of the book are very practical and fair minded. She doesn't insist that we abandon supersymmetry or string theory or any other popular or unpopular theory, only that we try to be scientific about the way that we do science."
272,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present nightmare (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. 
it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.

experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.
Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.
“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.
That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.
I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.

I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.
Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:
 I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying… I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.
(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:
According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”“You might be right.""
)She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:
I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.
This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):
A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.
Better than The Trouble with Physics which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. Her blog is extremely worthwhile and more technical and thus less untrue.* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"". But it is wrong to say that ""physics"" tout court has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)"
273,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17468009-galen-weitkamp,4,"Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder.Review by Galen Weitkamp.The first thing that struck me when I opened this wonderfully perplexing book is the table of contents. Chapter 1: The Hidden Rules of PhysicsIn which I realize I don’t understand physics anymore. I talk to friends and colleagues, see I’m not the only one confused, and set out to bring reason back to Earth.Chapter 2: What a Wonderful WorldIn which I read a lot of books about dead people and find that everyone likes pretty ideas but that pretty ideas sometimes work badly. At a conference I begin to worry that physicists are about to discard the scientific method.I felt like I was reading Don Quixote again in which each chapter title is followed by an extended subtitle (introduced by the in-which trope) that humorously summarizes the adventure ahead. The second subtitle above nicely introduces what is probably the main concern of Dr. Hossenfelder’s book. The general reader may be surprised to learn that Mathematics and Physics can be pretty. Indeed they can be, but you don’t have to agree - after all, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” There are many reasons why a mathematician or a physicist might think an idea is pretty, or beautiful or natural. For example, if it unifies under one explanation two disparate phenomena; or it generalizes a previous technique or assumption thereby promising to extend the latter’s domain of application. But how could a pretty idea waylay and corrupt the scientific method?To be regarded as a part of physics, an idea must have observable physical consequences. To be empirically distinct, it must have some observable consequences that distinguish it from other physical theories. To be acceptable it can’t have any consequences that contradict observation. Some of these things can be checked at the blackboard; but checking the predictions of a theory against the real world cannot. Observational verification can require a lot of time, effort and money. Since the Standard Model (of Particle Physics) was worked out in the seventies newer particle theories have been proposed that either generalize its symmetries (to make it mathematically more palatable) or attempt to geometrically unify particle theory with general relativity. Over the decades experiments have consistently confirmed the Standard Theory. No experiment or particle accelerator to date has been able to verify any of the distinguishable consequences of Supersymmetry, String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity. The issue for theorists is: what to do in the absence of experimental confirmation. What clues should one pursue, if observation provides none? What’s left other than one’s own prejudices about what’s natural, what’s pretty or what’s beautiful? Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder discusses these issues at length, and makes some suggestions. Physicists should be aware of confirmation bias and all the other kinds of bias to which humans are susceptible. She also suggests that physicists interested in foundational issues should focus on unraveling contradictions rather than on unification or prettifying the ugly. "
274,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,"Like Sabine writes and tries to address, physics has worked itself into a state where all our experiments result in null result after another, and our cutting edge theories are mere speculations of science fiction. The way she approaches this problem, trying to figure out how we got here, what we can do to fix it, and whether what we’re doing is justified in the first place, is wonderful. This is an excellent popular work on the cusp of physics and philosophy, but it comes with a little requirement of some understanding of theoretical physics. Recommended reading for scientists or scientists-to-be."
275,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, As a corrective to taking theoretical speculations in physics and cosmology too far this book does a good job. It is a lament that using aesthetics in mathematics as a guide to theory is an unreliable guide to science in general. The conundrum is this. The data at the foundations is getting scarcer and scarcer as we push the limits of experiment. Particle accelerators can't reach high enough energies to probe things the way we'd like. With the scarcity of data at the frontier theoretical physicists decorate unknown parts of the map with embroidery of a mathematical aesthetic. The author hammers this point repeatedly. But what else are theoretical physicists gonna do when left to their own devices without much data to go on. Outside of banning the profession (not a good move) theoretical physicists are gonna do what they do. I don't know outside of some skepticism what her plan is.
276,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Thematically similar to Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"" but not so similar as to be uninteresting. Contains some brief excerpts from interviews with a variety of physicists with widely differing views on the relevance of aesthetic principles in cooking up new physics. I found the style informal in a pleasant way, and there was enough technical detail (especially in the notes) for my taste as well."
277,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,5,"I liked Hossenfelder’s book a lot more than I was expecting. Given my expectations, I’m not sure why I bought it in the first place. I was expecting something along the lines of another physicist complaining that other physicists have abandoned empirical testability as the fundamental criterion by which to evaluate theories, and have gone wild with speculative, untestable theories like multiverse theory, string theory, and anthropic theories. And she does complain about that, but she also accepts that the solution cannot be simply to demand testability in some neo-Popperian dogmatism — there are good reasons for speculative mathematics in physics.The ultimate test of a scientific theory is still, by her thinking, empirical test. But that’s just part of the story. You can’t just “observe nature.” What do you observe? How do you observe it? What do you pay attention to? Those are all basic problems, although sometimes whisked by quickly as if their answers were obvious.Physicists look FOR things, led by speculative hypotheses. Their field of vision is narrowed by what they are looking for, and they construct increasingly complex (and expensive) ways of reaching the conditions under which they believe what they are looking for will be observable and in which they can focus their observations on what they are looking for. Doing so requires making bets on what they are likely to find, on what the unobserved parts of reality are like. Contemporary theoretical physics has reached this point in spades. Solutions to outstanding problems require energies beyond those reachable with current experimental technology (e.g., particle colliders) or observations of unreachable times and places (the early universe or hypothetical multiverses).Physicists have to make choices about which research directions are promising and which are not. Their funders have to make the same choices.But how, in the absence of empirical tests, do you evaluate speculative answers to problems? Of course, that’s not a new problem for physics or other sciences. Why did Kepler choose conic sections as a direction to pursue in understanding the orbits of the planets? The answer now doesn’t seem so different as the answer then.Physicists have had a long love affair with what Hossenfelder calls “aesthetic” criteria. Although the book’s title mentions only one criterion — “beauty” — and although Hossenfelder often talks about beauty as the criterion scientists use, it’s really an indistinctly bounded family of criteria, sometimes employed formally and rigidly and sometimes more intuitively.Chapter 5 of the book, titled Ideal Theories, distinguishes three criteria that she refers to as “presently popular themes” in theoretical physics. These are simplicity, naturalness, and elegance. Each has its own quirks and controversies.The influence of “beauty” in physics is certainly strong. Hossenfelder cites many examples, both within physics and in other scientific areas, where scientists have expressed the belief that a theory is so beautiful that it must or should be true. Paul Dirac is famous for his preference for mathematical beauty. Hossenfelder also cites the double helix model of DNA, said by James Watson to be “too pretty not to be true.”Things that are not pretty are things that are arbitrary, that have odd, unexplained values (the cosmological constant, or the mass of the Higgs boson), or that are overly complex and lack plain old intuitive comprehensibility (see Richard Feynman’s remark that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.”). Even when we have data against which to test theories, we still have an underdetermination problem. More than one theory, in fact many theories, may account for the data — which one do we choose? We use criteria such as the ones Hossenfelder talks about. And we, as she also recognizes, ask more than just that a theory account for the data — it should have some explanatory power as well — not just generate accurate predictions of result data but provide an understanding of how and why the results are what they are.Hossenfelder believes that the current criteria may or may not be the right ones, and may be rightly or wrongly applied. The problem shows itself in predictions that don’t come true (e.g., the new particles that, at least according to some accounts, should have been produced by now in runs of the Large Hadron Collider) or in a general chaos of theories, e.g., string theory or multiverse theory, that lack empirical tests and that provoke seemingly unresolvable debate.It’s important to realize that these criteria are not themselves empirical. It’s not as if scientists have tested naturalness, simplicity, and elegance and found, on the basis of empirical testing, that these are reliable criteria, their anecdotal successes notwithstanding.In part, what she prescribes is self-awareness. What are the assumptions, and what are the criteria that you are using in proposing a theory, or in devising ways of testing it? Are those assumptions and criteria examined? Can they even be well articulated? These questions sound at least partly philosophical, and Hossenfelder believes that a closer working relationship between philosophers and scientists is definitely part of the prescription. Too often, each has been trespassing, as fumbling amateurs, on the others' territory. One philosopher whose work she finds especially interesting is Richard Dawid, who has written a book (String Theory and the Scientific Method) probing into non-empirical evaluation of scientific theories. Philosophers like Dawid and cosmologists like George Ellis, with whom Hossenfelder talks late in the book, could build bridges between what has been a difficult relationship.Other prescriptions have to do with institutions, in which these “aesthetic” criteria have become embedded — universities, grant application and evaluation processes, publications and their evaluation criteria, . . . Hossenfelder includes an appendix, titled What You Can Do to Help, for scientists, administrators, policy makers, and others, including members of the public. Hossenfelder is easy to read. She writes in a colloquial, slightly irreverent manner — she presents herself as a dissatisfied member of the theoretical physics community looking for answers to the questions of the health of her profession. The book follows a kind of quest from place to place and interviews from one scientist to another (including names like Steven Weinberg, Nima Arkani-Hamed, as well as less mainstream theorists like Garret Lisi), trying to diagnose the problem physics has run into and how to get out of it. It feels very personal. She’s asking a kind of existential question — has my field totally gone off the rails, or do we have a way forward? I won’t spoil the ending."
278,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"This is a pretty interesting book. At the end of each chapter Hossenfelder gives a summary of her points. Essentially this book approaches a philosophy of science, although she doesn't speak of it. Instead she wants to know what the state of physics is today. She interviews many different people and in the process comes to some conclusion that the state of her discipline is that people have mistaken mathematics as foundational for doing physics instead of experimentation. What Hossenfelder misses is the vehicle of a ""metaphysics of presence"", which is a rhetorical/discursive modality of self-BSing. To a large degree many of the Platonists and mathematicians that seek Platonism fall under the spell of their own conjectures, believing them to have some inkling of a greater, more universal, Truth.In other words, Hossenfelder rightly points out that her colleagues are using Math to do philosophy instead of physics, even though the content of their discussions are from physics... essentially doing science is a method, an approach that is substantially different from the methods of philosophy which have a different manner of putting things together. Hossenfelder finds the long way around to say this, probably to explore different aspects of physics (as there are many scientists), and because she lacks the philosophical language to make her point. All in all, a nice book, even if with the right language, it could be tighter.(This can be seen as part of a larger debate. It is covered in a chapter by Imre Lakatos on the Analysis-Synthesis method used by Descartes -- and why it was rejected)."
279,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5157049-marie,3,"This is not my usual cup of tea, because I abandoned STEM long ago. It was sometimes heavy, interesting, witty, funny, even. And yet it got me going in a completely different direction of what beauty is, then again, like you can blame me for that. Just to clarify, Hossenfelder is no aesthete herself, as she uses a common definition: that beauty is a subjective criteria that we're too obsessed with seeking, but has no bearing in science (well, I could agree with this, but then again, the discussion about beauty is broader). In the case of physics, we're speaking of mathematical simplicity or expecting symmetry in physical theories that lead to things impossible to prove through experimental methods (i.e. some kinds of multiverse theories that seem pure terrible philosophical speculations to pretend you can control the whole destiny of the world because ""there's an universe where this could happen out there""One of my hobbies is to read about philosophy of science, particularly in the ethical / philosophical field, but this was a good reminder of the dangers of bad methodology and pseudoscience.The structure of the book follows between simple examples to understand physics and contemporary academia, interviews, and Hossenfelder's unmistakable use of sarcasm."
280,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605932-vidyadhar,4,"The author takes the core issues with the present situation in fundamental physics, and raises questions in the manner in which physics research is organized both in theory and observations. The main basis for these questions is quite clear: the time lag between developing and testing hypothesis has become very large. The author dubbed this as an eternal inflation and also reveals cognitive biases in theoretical physicists’ selection or rejection of problems, and correspondingly, in their skepticism about research. And its implications are that physicists might have “lost in math” to make predictions. On the contrary, most physicists still believe in what they do and hope to find the “right kind of math”. Those who can`t stand the situation leave, and those who stay are the ones with few complaints – or maybe they just manage to convince themselves everything is all right. Perhaps, because the “right kind of math”, like happiness, can’t be found by complaining about its absence."

283,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,2,"I thought I knew enough about physics as a lay person to understand this supposedly pop science book, but I was wrong. And I know for a fact that's not on me, but this author. MOST of it went completely above my head which made me very very annoyed, especially since I've read quite a few articles and a bunch of books dealing with astrophysics and particle physics that were written specifically for people from non-physics backgrounds and done just fine. The book went around and around in circles, I found no clear path or train of thought through it. I also found the tone condescending and whiny. I do not understand why she took such a long winding path just to come to the conclusion that the human sense of aesthetic shouldn't come in the way of science and theory-building. This entire book could have been summarised in just about a 100-page paper and it's really made me mad that I suffered through it and it was such an energy-block in my life. This is not to say that the content of the book was bad. Given what one learns by reading the book, anyone would agree that her premise is stable. Assuming things really are the way the author puts them, it's credible that physics is stagnating because of cognitive biases and researchers being led astray by human ideas of beauty, and also a belief that the laws of nature must be beautiful. Although, I am no physicist, and it's a bit disconcerting to believe the claim that so very many brilliant researchers are so wildly off-course. What is also disconcerting is the author saying 30 years of a lack of breakthroughs is a really big deal. Isn't 30 years next to nothing in scientific research time, especially with what particle physicists are trying to achieve today?? But perhaps those are my own biases.The book gets way easier, better, and more readable from the chapter on quantum mechanics onwards. Also, the appendix in which the author mentions ways in which we all can avoid falling prey to cognitive bias and be sure that researchers are not chasing after beauty and creating theories based on unconfirmed assumptions, is one of the most lucid and to-the-point parts of the book. After one wades through the cesspool of angst and jargon, the info and data in this book is interesting and very important. All in all, Lost In Math is probably best read by someone from a physics or at least a STEM background, and/or a high tolerance level. "

288,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,4,"The book reminded me of the excitement of reading physics again, after long time. In a time where science is becoming increasingly written by experts for experts, Sabine Hossenfelder gives a good view of the developments (or rather lack of developments) in the fundamental physics today. Modern physics has hit the plateau recently with the experiments becoming more costly and lengthy. Our quest to understand nature has reached a point where we have developed theories that are practically impossible to be verified by experiments. This questions the definition of science itself where we are trying to explain that is not observable. This is the main point of Sabine Hossenfelder criticism on the current approaches to scientific method and practices of the community. She takes this as an opportunity to present the current state and also rise questions around the content of recent proposals in fundamental physics. This is followed by a memoir of her travels conducting interviews with physics, (including Steven Weinberg, Garret Lisi, Nima Arkani-Hamed etc.) where she presents their views and opinions on the concerns. The book is interesting as it reminds our powerlessness in understanding the nature and how mankind might have been in similar states in history, challenged by the limitations of means to study deeper and longer. It helps us to rethink our understanding on physics vs. philosophy vs. fiction.I would also recommend to read Jeremy Butterfield's detailed review (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/19...) on the book that gives further insight into how the ideas of the book resonated with one of the contemporary philosophers. "
289,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"I am keeping tracking the modern books on theoretical physics, like those of Woit, Green, Carrol and others. The mathematics discussion from Sabine Hossenfelder is one of the newest on the block and a very pleasant read. There are three bascis themes in the book that are quite related. First, the lack of progress towards new enhanced theories of elementary physics in the last 20-30 years is described, and how all new measurments confirm the standard model from last century. Secondly is the way mathematicians and physisists deal with the ever growing difficulty to deal with this lack of progress (think multiverse appraoches as a last, probably not scientific, resort). And thirdly Hossenfelder worked on the question if beauty and naturalness should be leading factors in the design of new theories (a more philosophic topic).Sabine Hossenfelder writes her story more or less as the sceptic journalist. She interviews leaders in the field and discusses the above. But it is clear that she is not a fan of the multiverse approach and the beauty/naturallness thinking. Some alternatives are being probed as well, but these theories suffer from criticism from the field itself. She also explains that rogue thinkers have less and less opportunity to work down their theories due to funding and how modern theoretical physics works in the communicty. In this sense the book is a real folllow-up of Peter Woits ""Not even wrong"".The science in the book flips between very easy to understand to extremely difficult for a guy like me (for example Gauche theorie and Lie groups). I am still looking for a book that can help me understand what this exactly is and how the Standard Model came to be.Anyway, I think this is quite a light read, which summarizes the field quite well. Four stars."
290,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"There is no sign of supersymmetry despite decades of experiments. There is really no scientific motivation for its existence in the first place, beyond aesthetics, undefined notions of simplicity, and beauty subjectively conceived. Yet thousands of really smart people want to spend billions of dollars on new colliders to find it. This is dumb, Dr. Hossenfelder says so, and somehow she gets a ton of shit for it. Well, she doesn't say so exactly. What's great is she lets others make this point for her: Weinberg, Polchinski, Arkani-Hamed. The book is primarily interviews with some insightful glue from the author holding it together. While the failure of a new collider to detect SUSY or similar speculative predictions can be assessed objectively in terms of lost dollars, it's much harder to account for all the careers spent chasing false hopes. It makes me think of all the thousands of preprints that end up on the arxiv, many of which probably end up getting published, that are quite possibly ultimately about nothing. Fiction. Worse than ""first-order"" speculation like SUSY or string theory are the volumes of work on models built on these conjectures, like brane-world incarnations of inflation or dark matter that arises from some SUSY-infused GUT symmetry. To any aspiring physicist interested in high energy theory, they must seriously level with themselves: there's at least a decent chance that this house of cards built on so much sand is wrong; as in—it has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual universe. Are you ready to devote your life's work to it?"
291,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730704-john,2,"I’m not sure who the target audience of this book is, certainly not me. It investigates the current difficulties in particle physics and the lack of any real progress, or even current theories with any real promise. It’s a science in crisis, if you ask me, and Sabine Hossenfelder understands this.The problem with the book is that she assumes so much (if her target audience is people like me). She constantly bandies about various terms that she seems to understand, but she doesn’t really define, but assumes the reader knows what they mean. Here is one example:“‘The people looking for phenomenology,’ Joe goes on, ‘they all have the same problem, they have to reach across the remaining 15 orders of magnitude. It’s a very hard problem.For most of string phenomenology, it’s not so much that you have a theory, but that you have a possible phenomenology that someday may be part of the theory and it’s not because people are doing the wrong thing but because deriving phenomenology is such a difficult problem.’”I realize the author is quoting a physicist, but what the heck does this paragraph even mean? I could come up with multiple examples of this kind of passage because they are littered throughout the book and make it very difficult to understand, but you get the point. It’s like a nurse wrote a book on medicine and expects you to know all of the medical terminology, even the most arcane. So yeah, not my cup of tea."
292,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,5,"Very well written in a relaxed informal, at times conversational, voice. Hossenfelder has a wry sense of humor; a rare commodity in science writing. She's a good counter to authors like Sean Carroll - who I also like but who at times lacks a little humility.“Theoretical physicists used to explain what was observed. Now they try to explain why they can’t explain what was not observed.’She quotes George Ellis - 'Trust matters a lot in science. And if people go around saying it’s really possible that we live in a simulation, I can’t trust them as scientists, or even philosophers.’‘Minding the boundary between science and philosophy, I think, could help physicists separate fact from belief. And I don’t see a big difference between believing nature is beautiful and believing God is kind.’"

Sabine is erudite and well-argued, but often fails to really roast the (mostly) theoretical physicists she talks to, which I think would have made the book better - but her career most likely worse. What are you going to do. There is tons of interesting information contained within this book, and it is placed dead center in the current research environment - this is not a compelling history of mistaken geniuses or popular picture of the failure of physics, it is a serious whisteblower-account of a field gone awry, and if you don't know your muon from your quark and quantum field theory from quantum chromodynamics, this will be (slightly) difficult to follow. Bottom line: just because it is hard to score doesn't mean we get to move the goalposts. Strong recommendation."
294,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863686-david,5,"Brilliant, and an absolutely vital read if you are involved in research in the sciences. The critiques and lessons here extend beyond physics, stretching to the ways we fund, the ways we select for publication, the ways we reward thinking. Too long have these issues been ignored. Too long have those involved insisted that they were free of biases and cognitive distortion.But lest one think such a book must be a slog, let me set the record straight: this is a page-turner. Hossenfelder keeps things moving along briskly, and her frequent interviews with various major physicists all add real character to the proceedings. And there's plenty of wit, too. Mostly dry, often hiding near the end of a paragraph or in some parentheses or a footnote.Highly, highly recommended."
295,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"Those who follow physics blogs will be aware of the standing controversy between Sabine Hossenfelder and Lubos Motl. The former is a theoretical physicist who specializes in the phenomenology of quantum gravity; the latter, a former string theorist and dropout from the Harvard faculty who, apparently, no longer engages in any real fundamental research into high-energy physics but devotes himself largely to political activism, in causes such as climate denialism and anti-political-correctness agitation. Motl can be rude in the extreme to those with whom he disagrees (cheerfully ad hominem invective one of his favorite tropes), but is one who, if one sets aside his extreme political views, normally disports himself as capable of intelligent and incisive disquisitions in areas in which he possesses actual technical competence, such as string theory, supersymmetry, quantum theory and modern physics in general (but not at all climate science or any of the Geisteswissenschaften). His quite prolix postings on these topics are always worthwhile and informative. Philosophically, to speak nothing of theologically, he is rather naïve and uninformed. Hossenfelder, on the other hand, has the mind of a genuine critic. She is good at picking out the point behind an argument, in exposing fallacies and canards and in getting to the heart of the matter with unflappable criticism. Interested readers may wish to view her videos addressed to the scientific layman in which she outlines the status quaestionis and her own views on many topical issues of the day, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the measurement problem, black holes, quantum gravity etc. Hossenfelder does allot some place to philosophy, recognizing the stimulating role it has played in many revolutionary scientific advances (though her own philosophy of science would have to count as unconventional). At least, she attends conferences in the philosophy of science, writes papers on the subject and engages in epistolary exchanges with philosophers of science. Thus, it is an occasion of note when Hossenfelder has set down her thoughts on what she views as the crisis in physics in a long-awaited book-length publication.The plan of Hossenfelder’s Lost in Math consists in a somewhat loosely organized series of reflections on the current state of physics—meaning, for her, fundamental physics, which embraces high-energy theoretical particle physics, quantum gravity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics—punctuated by interviews with leading practitioners in the mentioned fields. Her list of interviewees reads like a who’s who in the physics community: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, Chad Orzel, Joe Polchinksi (but not, unfortunately, the presumably hard-to-get Edward Witten), and some lesser figures: Xiao-Gang Wen, Katherine Mack and Garrett Lisi. Interestingly, Hossenfelder has declined to interview Lee Smolin or Peter Woit, who presumably share her skepticism to some degree.The reader will find layman’s accounts of supersymmetry, the hierarchy problem, inflationary cosmology, dark matter and other things on the research frontier. Though pitched to the average educated reader, Hossenfelder’s tract is not intended as a popular exposition of the physics along conventional lines, so these explanations are kept fairly brief. What interests her, rather, is what she perceives as the decades-long crisis in fundamental physics and the underlying reasons behind it. For little of fundamental significance has been discovered in high-energy physics for going on forty years, apart from the celebrated empirical confirmations of settled theory at CERN and Fermilab (W and Z particles in the 1980’s; top quark in the 1990’s; most recently, the Higgs boson in 2012). Lost in Math covers many but not all issues at the research frontier in fundamental physics and cosmology. As the title indicates, the author attributes the crisis mainly to an uncritical attitude towards mathematical beauty on the part of the leading practitioners in the field. In the absence of experimental breakthroughs that might throw light on phenomena beyond the standard model, theoreticians have fallen back on internal criteria by which to evaluate and judge candidate theories, among which are those of an aesthetic nature. Hossenfelder hazards a definition of beauty in physics as the concurrence of three desirable things: simplicity, naturality and elegance. These concepts will require some elaboration in the scientific, not so much artistic context of physics; note that they are internal criteria having nothing to do with empirical prediction or confirmation. Simplicity has to do with Occam’s celebrated razor; we admire it when a single principle explains a broad range of phenomena and brings them under a common roof. Outstanding examples include Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism and more recent unification of electromagnetism and the weak force by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Naturality is a little less tangible, but we appreciate when things fit together nicely and unforcedly, as if the theoretical idea in question was destined to play this role. Naturality also has a technical definition in terms of the dimensionless constants entering the theory. These should be on the order of unity (with considerable leeway, give or take a few orders of magnitude). Many feel that an explanation is called for when a numerical constant turns out to be either very small or very large. The last criterion is elegance, also somewhat hard to define but one knows it when one sees it. Einstein’s general theory of relativity is most elegant, for instance, whereas theories of modified gravity such as the tensor-vector-scalar theory are repulsively inelegant, even though they, too, have the formal property of covariance. A good sign of elegance in a theory is when it leads to unexpected and surprising results, beyond what it was originally formulated to solve. Surely, this imparts the ring of truth?But, as Hossenfelder points out with justice, beauty alone is not infallible. In the history of physics, there have been many beautiful ideas that fail and numerous cases of ugly theories that work. Among the former, she lists Plato’s theory of the regular polyhedra as models of the four elements, Ptolemy’s circular planetary orbits, the static or steady-state universe (of Parmenides and lately Hoyle), the nineteenth-century theory of atoms as vortices in the aether and the late Heisenberg’s unified theory involving a fundamental length; among the latter, quantum mechanics itself, which its founders found to be troubling and counterintuitive, renormalization in quantum field theory, Kepler’s elliptical orbits and the big bang theory of cosmological origins. In Hossenfelder’s view, there is no reason why beauty should be expected to work. Aesthetic criteria based on experience will not necessarily apply to theories about a new domain of phenomena.In Hossenfelder’s telling, the reliance on illegitimate aesthetic criteria leads to a vicious circle: unmotivated hypotheses beget negative experimental results, which imply a lack of useful data that in turn leaves theoreticians with no recourse other than to propose further unmotivated hypotheses. Obviously, when experiment yields no hint of novel phenomena beyond the standard model, as has been the case in fundamental physics for decades, it will not prove very helpful for the development of successful new theories. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was widely predicted during the first decade of the twenty-first century to unveil any number of new effects: supersymmetry, extra large dimensions of space-time, microscopic black holes, parallel universes—what have you. Nothing unusual showed up. The sole successful prediction was the Higgs boson, which was not rooted in an argument from beauty (at least, as we would ordinarily conceive it).Despite all these negative results, the partisans of beauty in physics have not given up. Still today, there are several problems which in Hossenfelder’s telling are non-problems because rooted merely in aesthetics: the supposedly abnormally low mass of the Higgs (relative to the scale of grand unification); the small value of the cosmological constant; the small electric dipole moment of the neutron; the three gauge symmetry groups that appear in the standard model without explanation; and lastly the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces. What is the author’s take on all this? We might have to accept these things arbitrarily; the cosmological constant, for instance, might well be a constant of nature whose value is just what it happens to be. Hossenfelder contends that the sole instance in which aesthetic criteria have lead to a breakthrough in physics, historically speaking, is when they give rise to the solution of a mathematical inconsistency. For example, Galilean invariance is incompatible with Maxwell’s equations (led to special relativity); special relativity is incompatible with Newtonian gravity (led to the general theory of relativity); special relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics (led to the development of quantum field theory); spontaneous symmetry breaking is mathematically inconsistent without a Goldstone mode (led to prediction of the Higgs).Hossenfelder formulates her lapidary final conclusion in light of her reconstruction of the history of physics: ‘Ein empfundener Mangel an Schönheit is kein Widerspruch und daher kein echtes Problem’—a perceived defect of beauty is no contradiction and hence no genuine problem. This reviewer will suggest below that things are not quite so simple as that. Hossenfelder has not sufficiently analyzed what motivates the theoretical innovations that led to the resolution of the above-mentioned mathematical inconsistencies. Aside: isn’t the requirement of mathematical consistency itself ultimately an aesthetic argument?Now to some criticisms of the present work: its organization is somewhat loose, dictated by the need to go over the author’s interviews with leading scientists in different chapters rather than to proceed thematically. The author jumps from one subject the next, seemingly on the spur of the moment. The book can be repetitive, as the author and her interlocutors keep circling around the same few points. Off-the-cuff treatment of deep issues in the philosophy of science can be disappointing; Hossenfelder is not a systematic thinker. What is most important, the text is missing a condensed argument on principle against naturality, such as the author is very well capable of and has written technical papers on in the past. In fact, earlier this year, Hossenfelder gave a lecture to promote her book at the University of Stuttgart on May 14, 2019 (in German with English subtitles). This lecture is tightly organized and states the problem, as well as her own views, in a very condensed and accessible form. The curious layman might well prefer to spend an hour to watch the video of the lecture and, thereby, to spare himself the outlay of time it would take to read a 300-page book (this review has found it convenient to follow the outline of the lecture more closely than the book itself).This reviewer’s own views on the subject of the crisis in physics and the role of beauty: it is a mistake when Hossenfelder, following the general opinion in the physics community, concedes to string theorists a monopoly on beauty; a critical appraisal of the concept of mathematical beauty is needed anyway (along the lines of Kant’s critique of judgment). The author’s definition, mooted above, remains too descriptive. It does not get to the core essence of the phenomenon, which must have to do with the interaction of the faculties (sensibility, imagination, the will, understanding and reason). Perhaps something akin to Kant’s disinterested Zweckmässigkeit is involved in the judgment of beauty in the mathematical sphere, as well as in art. Needless to say, since we are talking about beauty in mathematical physics proper, a truly philosophical account would have to demarcate the respective domains of mathematics and physics and how they are interconnected. A tall order!In this reviewer’s judgment, Hossenfelder largely misses the point of mathematical beauty in physics due to a foreshortened historical perspective; her narrative is very much mired in current controversies, going back not more than thirty years versus the long track record that mathematical beauty enjoys in the history of physics all the way back to Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton; Einstein’s general theory of relativity; Dirac’s electron-positron theory; non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory and Gellmann’s eight-fold way in high-energy particle physics etc. What, then, is the point? Beauty, according to the definition sketched above which will serve as a reasonable starting point, does appear to be associated with innovative and revolutionary ideas. The explanatory power of such ideas is connected with the fact that they open up a new domain of phenomena to investigation and, normally, one can proceed from the simplest of starting points, hence their marks of simplicity, naturality and elegance. Ugly, ad-hoc ideas tend to be associated with unoriginal thought in Kuhn’s decadent normal phase, when all the nice, simple problems have already received solutions and one must proceed to ever-more complicated and baroque constructions, hence the lack of simplicity, naturality and elegance. We have seen plenty of these, particularly in the high-energy phenomenology of grand unification and in the string-theory landscape or moduli space of compactifications. Now, the error being made by contemporary theorists is to mistake beauty for originality. Yes, original thought often leads to a beautiful formulation of a theory, but this does not mean that every speciously beautiful theory must be original. Rather, these days one resorts to mathematical ideas known for their beauty and seeks to craft a physical theory around them—which is to put the cart before the horse!We could wish, in the closing chapter on how to address the crisis constructively, for more elaboration on how to structure the scientific community to mitigate disincentives to high-quality work. Hossenfelder names a number of sociological factors at play: more scientists pursuing academic careers than ever, closer contacts and collaboration among geographically dispersed scientists, short-term contracts constantly up for renewal, greater publicity meaning one has to pander to the tastes of the public. Not mentioned here in the text, but something the author has indeed devoted much thought to, are cognitive biases that hold back the untrammeled exploration of ideas. For instance, the well-known phenomenon of group-think, certainly at play in the physics community, militates against objectivity."

Find out all about her and her works on her website here.WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?Students young and old, and all those who want to extend their knowledge of particle and astro physics will love Lost In Math. It is also a powerful tool for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN).SYNOPSISDr. Hossenfelder’s compelling discourse on the subject of physics is not the usual heavily analytical, numerically driven revelation that is difficult to comprehend. Its focus is on an a selection of interviews with varied illuminated physicists. Dr. Hossenfelder then discusses the interviews and provides her opinions and views. She believes totally in the a priori method of traditional science. Yet she understands the elegant math of nature is a beautiful thing. She cautions us to guard against believing without empirical based evidentiary support.Dr. Hossenfelder posits that the tug-of-war between the empirical (hard facts) and the esthetics nature (soft elements) creates a stress for those struggling to find unity. It is these esthetic judgements that she credits as the driver of present day research.Dr. Hossenfelder shares her acumen and her considerable familiarity with the subject in a clear and concise manner, and without recourse to seemingly bottomless equations. Her sense of humor, whist dry gives the book a certain lightness not normally evident from such an able scientist. Her informal method aids the demystification of the subject for non-mathematicians.The interviews are interesting and informative, but it’s Dr. Hossenfelder’s opinions that take the work to the next level. Her eloquent elucidation on the status of theories and concepts are beautifully paced and completely engaging throughout. When she does feel that a concept requires a challenge, she does so in a compassionate manner.CONCLUSIONLost in Math is a solid read. It is tolerable even for those who avoid mathematics like the plague. Dr. Hossenfelder takes the time to verbally guide you through each topic, and you will almost never have to fear having to face down one of those pesky equations. You will have to endure a brief mention of leptons and quarks, but they quickly pass and are replaced with a discussion on dark matter and dark energy. I found myself falling in love with the totally engaging supersymmetry (loving SUSY). Forget your calculator, just jump in and enjoy this wonderful work. I guarantee you won’t regret it.Lost in Math was the very best read on the subject of theoretical physics that I have read in quite some time. Dr. Hossenfelder’s humor carried the day by diluting the technically advanced concepts and explanations. The interviews are generally unremarkable, however her criticism of each is a revelation.I do wish that the book had included more and larger plates. I would also have liked footnotes. That said, I found the appendices to be extremely helpful. Although Dr. Hossenfelder attempts to explain the mathematical and scientific method relating to the subject, those unfamiliar with basic theoretical physics concepts may struggle to follow.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Dr. Sabine Hossenfelder, NetGalley, and Basic Books for affording me the opportunity to review Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray.⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Given that caveat, I really enjoyed this book. Hossenfelder has misgivings about how some current theories of particle physics are evaluated. Everyone agrees that the definitive test of a theory is how well it predicts experimental data, but what does one do when the theory cannot be tested experimentally. Should we fall back on concepts like mathematically beauty? Hossenfelder discusses supersymmetry in great detail which by the current standards of the physics community it is beautiful. It has a yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. It predicts a dark matter particle with properties very close to what is needed to explain the structure of universe and it predicts the unification of the strong force with the electroweak force. It also predicts that many new particles would be seen at the LHC, and they haven't. My favorite quote in book is from Frank Close. ""The case for susy would be even more compelling if, well, it had been discovered."" Hossenfelder has been bothered by this use of beauty to determine, which theories to work on. She is worried that we may be missing the correct explanation, because too many people are pursuing beautiful theories that can't be tested. She does not merely express her opinion. She goes on a world wide search to talk to some of the brightest theorists in the world. Hossenfelder interviewed many so many Nobel Prize winners that early in the book she jokes that Brian Greene has not won a Nobel Prize when she discusses his book the Elegant Universe.I understood the book and enjoyed it, but I worry about recommending it to people without the background. I will see if I can get my wife to read my copy. She quite bright but has a completely different background."
298,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.]I can’t say for sure that I understood everything in this book, since my knowledge of physics in general is very patchy, but overall, I liked its tone, and its global idea, because I can get why one would be easily led astray by theories that look ‘beautiful’. It’s something that I feel is very human, after all, as we often look for a form of harmony in the world surrounding us, if only to try and make sense of it. Perhaps the fundamental, underlying laws of nature don’t make that much sense, or don’t always look like they do, and so we try to understand them in ways that would reconcile us with an apparent lack of… meaning, maybe? But what if the theories we pursue, albeit ‘pretty’ and nicely wrapped, turn out to be wrong? Shall we keep pursuing those, in the hopes that we just haven’t seen proof yet due to technological limitations, for instance? It seems that the answer to this isn’t so clear cut. (The LHC being a good example. I’m tremendously excited by the LHC, and what it allowed to prove so far… but while we got the Higgs boson, we still haven’t gotten supersymmetry.)The book also gave me pointers about things of which I clearly don’t know enough, especially in order to understand where the author comes from, so I know I’ll have to focus on those at some point in order to learn more.As a side note, I don’t know, but I don’t feel particularl bothered by the ‘ugliness’ of the Standard Model. It may be in part because all I know about it, I learnt on my own, without following the regular cursus, so I never approached it with any specific idea in mind? We’ll see once I’ve studied more.Conclusion: Definitely interesting, although don’t approach it if you know next to nothing to physics, since some ideas won’t make sense otherwise."
299,0465094252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233709-sunni-c-vanreads,3,"Sabine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray is a critique at theoretical physics discipline and how it's physicists are too focused on finding beautiful theories. In her case, beautiful theories are one's that have mathematical equations that fit nicely with their theories. However, she states that sometimes these discoveries are messy and there is no streamlined equation to fit. It's an interesting take on physics. I'm not a physicist myself, but I definitely find that other popular nonfiction physics books focus a lot on the wonders of physics. Her book adds a different dimension to this discipline that I would have never thought of on my own. Her writing style is candid and if feels as if you are with her as she interviews renowned physicists around the world to learn more about their quest for beauty in physics. It's also a bit funny at times. I felt as if the science she describes in Lost in Math is a bit complex for me, but I found an appendix at the end of the book to refer to for brief explanations of the scientific theories she mentions. Sadly, it was a bit hard for me to flip back and forth in an e-book so I didn't do this, and I only found out when I got to the end. I would recommend this to people who are interested in physics and probably have a bit more general knowledge on it. Thank you NetGalley for letting me read and review this ebook."
