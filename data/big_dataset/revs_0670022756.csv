But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming."
1,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"Summary: Lose, philosophical rambling, plus an insightful take on Many Worlds.Author's favorite word: parochialI'm trying to be more positive in my reviews. Here are the good parts:* Plausible story of the evolution of the technology of numerals.* Refutation of anthropic reasoning for being a bad explanation.* Introduction to infinite set theory using the idea of Infinity Hotel.* Refutation of the Precautionary Principle for being pessimism.* A clever, made-up tale of Socrates and Hermes on epistemology.* Intro to Philosophy of empiricism, instrumentalism, realism, etc.* Some nice anecdotes on the history and importance of the Enlightenment.* Nice definition of a ""good"" theory: one that breaks if you change it.* Definition of fungibility and its application in economics and physics.* An novel description of Many Worlds which emphasizes fungibility.Now, on to my gripes.Gripe #1: Many WorldsThat last ""good part"" is actually an interesting and unique insight! In this interpretation of quantum mechanics, universes branch and merge. Branching is seen as an effect on one of an infinite number of fungible universes. This is equivalent to entanglement. Merging produces a number of possible histories, all of which are real. This is equivalent to measurement. Too bad only one half of one chapter was dedicated to exploring it! Notice that this does NOT solve the measurement problem. It is equivalent to the Copenhagen Interpretation in all predictions. The only novelty is in the explanation, which is all the author claims. So, it's fun to think about! But it does not refute the Copenhagen interpretation, as the author claims. He also dismisses the Copenhagen interpretation as bad philosophy. He calls it ""instrumentalism, anthropocentrism, studied ambiguity"". Ouch!s None of these accusations are valid, and are really quite insulting to the mainstream.Gripe #2: No force of gravity in GRThe existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by General Relativity. Actually, the classical force of gravity emerges from the curvature of spacetime. But instead of using these correct words, he assaults the sensible reader with hyperbole. Later on emergence is discussed, but too little too late.Gripe #3: Occam's RazorOccam's Razor is labeled as a ""misconception"" and rejected as a poor technique. But the ""Occam's Razor"" described by the author is not the one practiced in reality. According to the author, it isn't simplicity that makes for a good explanation. It is how hard the explanation is to very. This does NOT account for the situation where two explanations are equally hard to very! Only when this is the case does Occam's Razor come into play.Gripe #4: TransmutationThe author doggedly refers to thermonuclear fusion as ""transmutation"". He also brings it up several times in early chapters as a non sequitur. That was really weird...Gripe #5: Quantum JumpsThe author argues there are no such thing as quantum jumps, only smooth transition. This claim is not justified by evidence or theory. Atomic electron transitions or ""quantum jumps"" are an unmistakable part of quantum theory.Gripe #5: Star Trek TransporterThe author gets us thinking about multiple universes with an anecdote from science fiction. Then, instead of moving on to talk about the real world, he keeps up the charade. Never does he actually justify any of his argument by comparing it to experiment. The whole chapter is veiled in a cloak of fiction, so as to defend against criticism. Once the veil is dropped, he's back to your basic Many Worlds interpretation, nothing more. So, why all the wasted time in fantasy land? I don't get it.Gripe #6: Bohmian MechanicsThe author dismisses Bohmian Mechanics as nothing more than a flavor of Many Worlds. This is blatantly incorrect. Bohmian Mechanics is a non-local theory, where as locality is preserved in Many Worlds.Gripe #7: InstrumentalismThe most brutalized viewpoint in the book is instrumentalism. He calls it a ""bad philosophy of science"" because it doesn't require explanation. Of course, this is false, because explanations are part of the instrument. The author uses the jibe ""shut up and calculate"", but that is bad instrumentalism! The good instrumentalist avoids the real vs. anti-real debate altogether. It seems that the author is objecting instrumentalism as an excuse for bad explanations. I agree that it is often used as an excuse, but that doesn't make it bad philosophy.Gripe #8: PlasmaThe author claims that most matter in the universe is the plasma found in stars. Actually, most of the matter in the universe is found in the intergalactic medium. This is also a plasma, but isn't (yet) part of a star!Gripe #9: Reach of General RelativityThe author makes a big deal about the ""reach"" of a theory. He defines reach as the range of energies, distances, times, etc. where the theory works. General Relativity has a grand reach, but he claims its reach to be infinite. This is not true, because at the big bang and event horizon of black holes, it fails.Gripe #10: Infinite ProgressThe main thesis of the book is that progress is infinite. This is justified using an inductive argument: Since science has continued to produce new, better theories with greater reach, it will continue to do so indefinitely. But in the first chapter, the author claims inductivism to be bad philosophy, contradicting the argument for the book's thesis.I agree with the author that we won't reach the end of science any time soon, if ever. But the whole point of the book is that the process necessarily is infinite, and I disagree. For one thing, all species have a finite lifetime, providing a necessary end to progress."
2,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,5,"This book is about rational optimism. For the past few hundred years in the West, science and logical thinking have been changing things for the better. The author believes we are just beginning an era of continual progress that has no bound.His key idea is that science is defined by seeking explanations for the universal laws that govern reality. Explanations go beyond simply describing what we observe, or “instrumentalism”. A good explanation has “reach” – it explains not only what we see, but continues to work in situations we never anticipated. For example, Newton’s laws of motion explain both a falling object on Earth, and the orbits of the planets.A poor explanation, such as “God did it”, could explain anything, and therefore explains nothing. Even if God exists, this statement does not explain how he did it, which is what is relevant for science. What Deutsch calls bad philosophy is not only a poor explanation, but it also sets up a system that is immune from criticism (such as “God’s will cannot be questioned”). This prevents anyone from challenging the philosophy.The source of our theories is conjecture, which are then subjected to criticism. All theories are wrong, or at least incomplete. Criticism permits better explanations to emerge. This kind of error correction is critical to making any system work. Deutsch states that the prime moral imperative is to never suppress the means of criticism and error correction.Deutsch examines William Paley’s argument in 1802 that life must have been designed. He shows this argument is profound, limited only what was not known at the time.What is the difference between a stone and a watch? Paley may have thought the stone was created as is, while today we know that it has been through a complex process driven by the formation of the earth and plate tectonics. But that makes no difference. The watch was clearly not assembled by plate tectonics or any other natural process. If any small change is made to it, it ceases to function as before, while if the stone is broken in pieces, you have more stones. The design process for the watch involves stepwise refinement with the correction of errors that result in a functioning watch. The stone also went through a refinement process, but the fundamental difference is there was no error correction feedback. The watch cannot be properly understood without knowing its purpose. And if there is purpose, there must be intent, and therefore a designer.A mouse has all the same attributes as a watch, so it was quite reasonable to conclude that it must be designed as well, therefore has a designer. And he is right. However, we now know the purpose of the mouse: to replicate its genes. The designer of the mouse is not a person; it is the stepwise process known as natural selection, with a system of error correction that removes mouse designs that fail to reproduce their genes.These ideas are clearly central to the book, as can be seen by the watch the author is examining on the front cover. The watch and a good scientific explanation share the fact that small changes made to either will break them. Bad explanations and stones can be changed significantly, and they still function as they did before.The author explores the concept of a universal system, which means a small digital system that can be used to create new things without itself being modified. Digital systems are required because they have built in error correction. Variations are rounded to the nearest decimal digit, whereas in analog systems the errors can accumulate. An example is the alphabet, which can generate any new word using the same letters, or ten digits that can generate any possible number. Language itself is a digital system. While we can make an infinite number of sounds, of which only a subset are used for our words. The first universal digital system was the genetic code, which somehow evolved from the original chemicals on the Earth. All of these systems had non-universal origins, and what he calls the “jump to universality” was a final stepwise refinement that had much more power than simply solving the intended problem. For example, for the first few billion years the DNA system only created bacteria. Much later we got multi-celled organisms, and in 1994 the first DNA computer was made, a possibility inherent in the original design of DNA.The author’s field of expertise is quantum mechanics. He points out that while the equations of Heisenberg and Schrodinger describe the behavior of subatomic particles, there is no single explanation in words, or interpretation, that is universally accepted. He strongly objects to the majority Copenhagen interpretation that claims quantum mechanics cannot be understood, deriding it as “shut up and calculate”. He points out that “This combination of vagueness, immunity from criticism, and the prestige and perceived authority of fundamental physics opened the door to countless system of pseudo-science and quackery supposedly based on quantum theory.” His favored interpretation is many worlds, or the multiverse.Deutsch develops an interesting argument against sustainability on “Spaceship Earth.” He points out that the biosphere is actually hostile to human life – just try living in a natural environment with no artificial help and see how long you last. Life is actually sustained by our knowledge of how to manipulate that hostile environment.Sustainable has two conflicting meanings. One is to keep us alive, surely a good thing. The other meaning is to keep things the same. But static societies fail when unexpected changes occur, as they always do. Our survival depends upon the ability to adapt to change, which means the current mode of production should not be sustained. Hence the praise for unsustainability.Paul Ehrlich was the ultimate resource pessimist. His fallacy is to compare the known inventory of present resources, extrapolated into the future, with the unknown possibility of finding new resources, or technical innovation that reduces the need for them. The predictions of this kind of pessimist tend to be very wrong.After blasting environmentalists like Paul Ehrlich, he then addresses climate change. I was expecting him to dismiss the issue, but I forgot he warned against blind optimism, and realizes that problems are inevitable.He clearly spells out the reality of climate change in line with the great majority of scientists. He also points out that predictions of economic consequences fail to take account of future innovation. He even uses the word “disaster”, but to him it equally means possible climate impacts, and the impact stopping progress to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He says that solutions that disable our ability to grow and innovate will not work. Prevention and delaying tactics are useful, but can be no more than a minor part of a viable strategy for the future. We need a large and vibrant research community, interested in explanation and problem solving. We need the wealth to fund it, and the technological capacity to implement what it discovers.Deutsch defines wealth as the repertoire of physical transformations that one is capable of causing. I would like to point out that wealth spent on personal consumption while starving scientific research for needed funds will not contribute to the solution. In general, the problem with relying on scientific method to solve our problems is that we humans did not evolve to think that way. It takes great effort and training to think scientifically, and even scientists often forget it the moment they step out of their labs.This book is full of challenging ideas. Some chapters are clearly written, while others were beyond my comprehension. Maybe if I read them a few more times I will get the point. However, my understanding of science has changed because of this book, and that is the highest praise I can think of."
3,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431894-rachel,3,"Can you give a book a one AND a four? This book has me split. I didn't really like it, but I did make it through and give myself credit for that (although I skipped the sections where he plays like Socrates...weird...how did his editor let that through?). And even though I didn't like it, it made me think in directions I hadn't gone before. That's worth a lot. The author is prideful and arrogant and really rather strange, But he is good at explaining bizarro physics concepts that are on the surface defy logic and common sense. I enjoyed reading some of his views. Others really annoyed me. This is one of those books though that I don't know how much credit to give it because I have so little background here. The author does say that his view is a minority opinion, even among physicists. He doesn't really explain why so many people don't agree with him - just reiterates (fairly convincingly) that the way he is explaining things is the only way it all makes sense. I stongly felt like I was getting only one side of the story. That if I heard the other side I might be equally convinced (because again, I know nothing here... I'm relying on ""experts"")Worth reading. Add salt. Take the good and noodle on the rest. It might make good dinner conversation. "
4,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671549-anastasia-hobbet,5,"David Deutsch is brilliant, iconoclastic, and so sure of himself that it takes my breath away. No political correctness here! And no homage to that creaky old ideal of writing within your own speciality. But then he's a cosmologist, so what's not within his specialty?! Accordingly, this book is about absolutely everything. It includes critiques of contemporary science fiction, conversations between Socrates and his adherents, trips into intergalactic space, and a thorough discussion about the pros and cons of representative government--globally. You'll also spend some instructive time on Easter Island, where Deutsch manhandles the artistic reputation of the former residents. Nothing is sacred to Deutsch--least of all religion--except for the concept of human ingenuity. He sees the humankind as immortal--because we're thinkers and doers. We read and write and pass on critical, evolving knowledge from generation to generation. Our intelligence has what he calls 'reach,' and he sees us, eventually, as emigrants to other worlds: We will make the Enlightenment universal. Mind-bending and wholly surprising from chapter to chapter. I will read this again soon."
5,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,2,"Who knew that the beginning of infinity was also the start of boring, I mean really, what a crappy way to have to spend infinity. Anyway, this book is dryly written (despite what the back of the book jacket says) and confusingly uneven with some parts being informative and some being so incomprehensible that they would likely put somnambulists to sleep.As far as I can tell, the author has a valid thesis which is that human intelligence can solve any problems we face as long as people remain open minded about their thought processes and put seeking truth ahead of everything else. This thirst for knowledge started or gained steam with the great awakening of the Renaissance and has grown exponentially since then. Only by keeping an open society and continuing to build upon past research and looking for best answers will humanity continue to develop and strive for this infinity of knowledge (hence we are at or near the beginning of infinity).If that sounds interesting, add about 300 pages, 3 fewer jokes, some quantum mechanics including a discussion of the Many Worlds hypothesis, and an author with a bigger ego than the US national debt, and you have the Beginning of Infinty. That said, there are some interesting concepts in the book so don’t let me dissuade you if it is on your to read list as there is a really thoughtful and interesting book here, it just needs a more skilled writer."

8,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"In this book the author David Deutsch argues that there is no or can be no end to how far we can, or other sentient creatures, can go in furthering our explanations of the universe. This is our knowledge will continue to grow with out bounds. He explains why explanations are the key element in our gaining knowledge, and not the standard true justified belief of epistemology. He attempts to show how induction and empiricism fail to describe our knowledge acquisition. He believes science is practiced in the Popperian way of conjecture and critique. This is we first come up with an explanation and then we try to attempt to see if it holds up. And, this is the way we all gain knowledge, not just scientific knowledge. He believes that we create knowledge, and this is what separates us from other animals. He also looks forward to an optimistic future of continued problem solving. He has a chapter on Hilbert’s infinite hotel, the quantum multiverse, which he concludes is the only explanation of quantum goings-ons that currently works. He has several chapters on cultural evolution and the role of memes and creativity. His second to last chapter attacks sustainability, and why we should not be attracted to obtain it because it restricts ongoing knowledge acquisition. He believes we should seek unsustainable solutions because sustainability is stagnation, and in the end will fail, so are only choice is to continue to create newer and newer knowledge that will solve whatever current problems need addressing. In his final chapter he claims why we are only at the beginning of an infinity of knowledge. We are at the beginning because the enlightenment and scientific age is only two hundred years old, and a brighter and brighter future is ahead for humankind. And, there is no end to the knowledge we will obtain; that there will always be new knowledge to obtain.Here are some comments based on specific pieces of the text. Kindle locations are in brackets [][220] David Deutsch states: “The misconception that knowledge needs authority to be genuine or reliable dates back to antiquity, and it still prevails. To this day most courses in the philosophy of knowledge teach that knowledge is some form of justified, true, belief, where ‘justified’ means designated as true (or at least ‘probable’) by reference to some authoritative source or touchstone of knowledge.” (author’s italics) First, justification involves more than knowledge from some authority. It can be any form of evidence. He also leaves out true (i.e. aligns with the universe). It goes belief needs to be justified, and these beliefs only count as knowledge if the belief is actually true. In other words we must have some form of evidence, and it must be coherent with our other beliefs. In his terms we need an explanation in order to acquire a belief. But, for it to be considered knowledge under the standard form it also has to be true, not what some authority states as true. But, we often have to rely on secondhand knowledge. There is very little that we know from firsthand knowledge. Our knowledge may even require higher degrees of handedness.[1920] “Holists also often share with reductionists the mistaken belief that science can only (or should only) be reductive, and therefore they oppose much of science.” (author’s italics) I share Deutsch’s view on holists, but I call myself a reductionist because I hold out that science might indeed be successful in providing a complete reduction of science. He should also not argue against this belief because we have nothing to show it cannot be done with his optimism about what we can know. Having said this I also agree with him that different levels of explanation are possible. When we ask someone why they forgot to take out the trash, we do not want a reductive answer down to particles and forces.[3576] “Such an event [a gamma-ray blast in our galactic vicinity] is thousands of times rarer than an asteroid collision, but when it does finally happen we shall have no defense against it without a great deal more scientific knowledge and an enormous increase in our wealth.” (my italics) Wealth is one key ingredient that many (maybe all I have read) futurists ignore.[3713] “Yet there have been a few individuals who see obstacles as problems, and see problems as soluble.” I am mostly an optimist in my own life, where I do see problems as soluble. However, I do not hold out much hope that the world can solve all of its problems through science. Not that science may not be useful, but person to person issues, such as that involving religious disagreement do not seem likely to be solved anytime soon, no matter what science might discover. Having said this I do not hold it impossible. After all who would have thought the enlightenment (which Deustch thinks is so central in our advancement) would have occurred and would have had such an impact that it has had.[4351] In an imaginary dialogue Plato says in part: “Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.” Sounds like today’s fundamentalists, which Deustch may have been having a dig at here.[5566] “If a drug passes that test [saying they are happier], the issue of whether it really makes the patients happier, or merely altering their personality to have lower standards or something of the sort, is inaccessible to science until such time as there is a testable explanatory theory of what happiness is.” While I have issues with happiness studies too, does he really think people are so clueless when it comes to their own happiness. [6046] “They [voters] are choosing which experiments are to be attempted next, and (principally) which are to be abandoned because there is no longer a good explanation for why they are the best. The politicians, and their policies, are those experiments.” I began to wonder at this point if his explanation seeking was not just good old pragmatism and truth seeking here.[6082] “That gives all parties the incentives to find better explanations, or at least to convince more people of their existing ones, for if they fail they will be relegated to powerlessness at the next election.” I wish he would have provided some real voting examples to illustrated his political philosophy.[6469] “Arguments by analogy are fallacies. Almost any analogy between any two things contains a grain of truth, but one cannot tell what that is until one has an independent explanation for what is analogous to what, and why.” This was said in response to Marx’s use of biological evolution. However, the same could be lodge against meme theory, which Deutsch defends.Here is some more commentary on the book not link to any specific piece of text:(1) Deutsch’s major focus is to explain science and all knowledge acquisition as finding the best explanation. Under Karl Popper’s influence he sees that these explanations need to be testable. They need to be able to be discarded when they no longer provide the best explanation we can devise. And, they need to be narrow enough that to shade off to the side a little bit destroys it, and it needs to have reach—able to explain more than previous explanations. His reliance on Popper is problematic. For a good critical examination of Popper’s philosophy of science see Susan Haack’s Putting Philosophy to Work.(2) He argues against knowledge’s criteria—what counts as knowledge—as justified true belief. His main qualm is the use of evidence to justified an evidence claim. However, evidence is just one component to justification. The other is coherency—does it contradict other knowledge (i.e. how well does it fit in with other things we know already). See Haack’s Evidence and Inquiry for a good attempt to nail down what makes up or gives us knowledge. He seems to ignore the truth component. No matter how justified we our about our beliefs they have to jive with reality (this maybe all his testability comes to). He is correct that given this definition of what knowledge is that it is not unproblematic.(3) He also believes in conjunction with his focus on explanations that we have the capability to solve all problems we may encounter. And, this capability has no limit. He severely criticizes that there are limits to our growth as a human species. He basis this primarily on the fact that such predictions have all been wrong in the past (e.g. energy and resource depletion, environmental destruction). And, now possibly climate change (although, not as from the fashionable conservative debunkers). He calls the limits to growth sustainability arguments. His solution is not to purposely stop our growth, but to be optimistic that more solutions will be found in the future. The fact that such environmental predictions have failed in the past, does not necessarily imply that they will continue to fail, but neither does it show that these limits can ultimately be overcome.(4) He believes that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is the currently the only option to explain quantum effects. This is that all possible outcomes occur; it is just that each one occurs in a different universe. At the same time he is critical of multiverse theories. In my mind neither version has the necessary experimental backup to show that either of them are true. But, because of his reliance on explanations carrying the load in science he believes the many-worlds interpretation is the best one we have at the moment.(5) I am not a fan of meme theory as he appears to be. The analogy with the gene as the unit of genetic inheritance is not as tight as it would need to be to make the meme’s use anything more than metaphor. Does this make the meme concept worthless? I do not believe so; it is just that caution is need until such time, if any, we have a bona fide theory of memes. See The Electric Meme by Robert Aunger for a good book on producing such a theory—its pluses and minuses.(6) Finally, he is a big proponent of quantum computing. However, I have a knowledgeable goodreads’ friend that thinks it is not the computing panacea for computational complexity that it is most often portrayed as in popular science works if I understood him right.I found the book to be interesting. However, at times it seemed to drag under the weight of repetition. While I have my qualms about all of his views displayed in the book, I would agree that pessimism about our future capabilities to continuing to grow are knowledge is more or less misplaced. And, while I would temper his optimism toward solving all of our problems now and in the future, there is not any good reason to throw up our hands and surrender. Solutions may indeed be found; there is no necessarily impossibility to solving all our problems with an advance in our knowledge.This would be a good book for those interested in a sort of nonstandard view on philosophy of science. If you do not like or have the capacity to entertain different views on what science is, where it leads to, and its ability as a problem solver, than I would not suggest this book."
9,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is a very interesting introduction to modern research in computational complexity and its often intriguing applications to physics, cosmology and even philosophy. The part that struck me the most was his chapter on ""Optimism"". He argues that we are in the midst of an explosion of scientific knowledge and technology that may well continue for many years into the future, yielding a world that is far more advanced than anything we can imagine at the present time. He then argues further that there is no fundamental barrier to this progress. Here is an excerpt form pg. 212:Optimism is, in the first instance, a way of explaining failure, not prophesying success. It says that there is no fundamental barrier, no law of nature or supernatural decree, preventing progress. Whenever we try to improve things and fail, it is not because the spiteful (or unfathomable benevolent) gods are thwarting us or punishing us for trying, or because we have reached a limit on the capacity of reason to make improvements, or because it is best that we fail, but always because we did n to know enough, in time. but optimism is also a stance towards the future, because nearly all failures, and nearly all successes, are yet to come.Highly recommended."
10,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4117121-ed-van-der-winden,5,"I cannot stress the importance of this book enough. This book is about the power and potential of explanations and therefore also of our potential as a species, as the people who are able to create these explanations. Deutsh's book is an incredibly lucid and powerful explanation in itself and I will even go as far as to conclude that with this book Deutsch has become the most important philosopher of our time!Do yourself a favor and read this book! Deutsch's book is not technical and understandable by anyone with a decent brain. That includes you, otherwise you would not be reading this review. The book's arguments are as rational as they are optimistic (in every sense of the word, including the definition in the book itself). This is the kind of thinking that empowers us both as individuals and as a species. MARVELLOUS!"
11,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2916711-diarmid,3,"David Deutsch is a Fellow of the Royal Society and and expert on the quantum theory of computation based at Oxford University. Physics and an understanding of the laws of physics are at the core of this book, but it is just as much a work of philosophy, dealing as it does with progress and human society. Deutsch's contention is that the laws of reality can be known and will provide endless opportunity for investigation and the expansion of knowledge, that the principles of the scientific method established since the Enlightenment allow us to discover the laws of reality, and that there is no limit to human progress. Deutsch makes his argument brilliantly, and there is a great deal of speculation about optimism, memes, and the nature of intellectual progress that provides a new perspective on our society and where it might go, but the book as a whole is strangely unsatisfying. It is difficult to find fault with the arguments in the book, but it feels like Deutsch's view is ultimately lacking, that it looks at only one aspect of human progress and underplays others. For example, Deutsch references Jared Diamond's brilliant 'Guns, Germs and Steel' in it's examination of why indigenous societies in America were defeated and destroyed by European colonialism. Diamond's argument is based on resources and their effect of human development, which slowed and limited development in the Americas and allowed Europe to progress faster. Deutsch argues that a lack of resources does not present a barrier to human progress, as Enlightenment thinking will allow any lack of resources to be overcome or avoided, and will in fact change how resources are defined. The civilisations now in America have the same resources as the indigenous civilisations, but are vastly wealthier and more advanced because they use resources differently. The problem is that Deutsch claims that all pre-Enlightenment societies suffered from the same limitations, yet European societies were able to overtake and overwhelm indigenous societies. Medieval Spain was profoundly unscientific and riddled with the sort of ideas that Deutsch identifies as a barrier to progress, but was able to overwhelm the Incan empire and the other civilisations of the Americas. Deutsch argues that progress is based on a certain way of thinking, and that societies without that way of thinking are static and incapable of progress, yet that argument seems to be unable to address why pre-Enlightenment Europe managed to advance and overtake other areas of the world. On the other side of the coin, Deutsch argues that a society which uses Enlightenment thinking is capable of unstoppable and infinite growth. He does identify instances of other societies that have developed the same way of thinking, most obviously classical Athens, but he never really explains why these societies did not carry on progressing while arguing that our society will. In the end, no matter how brilliant Deutsch's argument it feels too simplistic to explain the complexities of human progress and the reasons why societies rise and fall, and thus inadequate to predict how our society will progress and how we will overcome the problems and threats that face us over the next decades. Deutsch's views on progress are fascinating and his views on optimism refreshing, but his argument as a whole feels ultimately slightly ephemeral and sophist, beautiful but not wholly practical. "
12,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,5,"I finished this book a month ago and at first I wasn't sure what I thought of it. But a month has gone by and I still think about it. In fact I think about it a lot.Some other reviewer mentioned that his favorite word was ""parochial"" which made me laugh because it does seem to be true. And I finally had to look it up in the dictionary because he only gave a one sentence definition of ""parochial"" that I thought was lacking. And by that I mean I didn't understand it. I looked it up online. I wish I had done it more towards the beginning of the book instead of the end. I was wishfully thinking that I would understand it from context. Oh well.There are entire chapters that seem a little pointless, some kind of rambling, and the multiverse chapter I gave up on half way through and skipped to the next chapter.The first two or three chapters though... wow. The first two chapters were amazing. I will be re-reading them again until it really sinks in. The question of ""how do we know what we know?"" is tackled, in the sense of he ran at it full speed, tackled it, slammed into the ground and pummeled it. It was first rate stuff.One part that stuck with me was the two plaques. ""Problems are inevitable"" and ""all problems are soluble"" has stuck with me. Setting arbitrary limits to the potential of human knowledge also really struck a chord with me. In fact over the last month I've found myself repeating ideas that I picked up in this book during conversations. I yelled ""Don't set arbitrary limits to human knowledge!"" over a beer at a bar the other night. It was all a bit pretentious. I might as well have been wearing a beret.The parts at the end of the chapter, especially the ""Meanings of infinity encountered in this chapter"" and his definitions were kind of silly. At least it felt silly to me. In fact lots of it felt silly. And yet, I gave it five stars, because I haven't read a book in a long time that has stuck with me like this one has. It is big, but not expensive. It is at times annoying, but so what. Actually that reminds me. Some reviews have complained about the manner in which the author seemed to discredit other ideas, theories, books and authors. But I liked it. To me it's like this: If you are right, and you can argue you right-ness, then why pussyfoot around it? If you have an argument to make then make it. If it is bad manners to say ""You are wrong and this is why"" then that is a problem with manners, as far as I'm concerned. If you think you are right, then say so, and then be prepared to back it up. This he did. There is nothing to be gained by starting each sentence with ""With all due respect"", etc. For example, he ripped into a book which I haven't read, but I know a lot of people who have, and who consider it to be in their top ten. I won't say the name, but it rhymes with ""Buns, Perms, and Peel"" and boy oh boy David Deutsch did not pull any punches. But thing is, he doesn't just say ""This idea is crap."" He follows up with a wickedly good argument as to why the idea is crap. I won't be able to read Buns, Perms, and Feel now because the premise has already been set up, examined, and knocked-the-*&^%-out by Deutsch. It's sassy. I like it. I like some attitude. Deutsch has a brain on him and he comes out swinging. Those parts were actually my favorites.As a whole, this book is equal parts flawed, silly, sassy, and downright brilliant. It is a gonzo combination. I wish more books were like this."
13,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/713607-tiffany-conner,5,"It's not often that I feel comfortable giving a book 5 stars. While I recognize that ranking books with stars is a decidedly arbitrary way to judge quality, if it will encourage other people to give this book the time it deserves, then 5 stars it is. There are so many good things to say about The Beginning of Infinity. I'll offer up some of the more unoriginal phrases of praise: Thought-provoking, eye-opening, original, insightful, erudite, and written in clear, accessible prose. I saw this book on the 2011 Notable Books list in The New York Times and put it in my wishlist as soon as I read the blurb. I've been on a reading kick trifecta in which I have found myself interested in reading anything I can about neuroscience, economics, and physics. Science in general has been on the top of my lists of late. I can't say why exactly. I am right crap at math and didn't study a hard science during university. Nevertheless, I have fallen in love with the stuff. Deutsch is a professor of physics at Oxford University, but his intellectual reach is impressive. If this book is any indication, Deutsch is probably one of the most learned authors I have ever read. The central theme of the book is that knowledge and progress are intertwined with an ability to ask good questions. Without this tradition of criticism and a continued examination of facts there can be no progress, and without progress humanity itself would not exist. Deutsch points to the Enlightment as the place in human history where this powerful, intellectual transformation and tradition of criticism originated, but he manages to do so without writing an off-putting screed about the superiority of the West and dismissal of ""The Rest"". The only ""superior"" in this narrative is knowledge. While there have been other periods of creative burst which have mirrored or predated the Enlightment, they were missing vital components which prevented them from becoming true building blocks in the ""beginning of infinity"". These other periods were without a tradition of criticism. Criticism creates creativity; criticism cultivates creativity; criticism creates culture--without criticism, societies cannot evolve and become great. It sounds simple enough, but in Deutsch's hands this deceptively simple argument is deftly composed, and any and all forays into what might initially seem like misguided tangents, are firmly fleshed out. You are learning something new on every page. Deutsch writes convincingly of the need to seek good explanations for answers, rather than rely on superstition or bad logic. He rejects relativism, empiricism, and behaviorism, among other things, in the name of good, critical thinking. And what's most fascinating about this is that Deutsch takes this general premise about the paramount nature of explanations to the transformation of the world and applies it to philosophy, art, space exploration, beauty, governance, among so many other things. And each time he makes a case, it's well-argued, well-supported, and very convincing. While Deutsch does write a little about physics, this is not a book purely about science or physics. It is a book about knowledge, how societies are improved with knowledge, and how the search for knowledge must always be at the heart of what we do as a species. It's an inspiring investigation. I am pleased to have stumbled upon this book. It is, without question, now one of my favorite books of all-time. "
14,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6169728-max-nova,5,"David Deutsch's ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is one of the more thought-provoking books I've read in the past few years. Its scope is incredibly broad - from epistemology and quantum fungibility to environmental ethics and societal evolution. Deutsch is a physicist (of self-admittedly fringe beliefs in regards to some quantum theory) and I'm always a bit skeptical when subject-matter experts try to extrapolate outside of their areas of speciality - particularly when they do so on as massive a scale as Deutsch does in this book. And ""quantum"" anything always puts me on high alert.Yet I found much of the book to be very compelling. Deutsch takes a deep dive into the nature of knowledge and human understanding, raising a profound question: is there a limit to what can be understood? Deutsch claims that no, our understanding is always at the ""beginning of infinity"" and there will always be an infinite amount more left to understand. If true, this has deep implications for how we organize society and how we think about life. I'm reminded of Shelly Kagan's claim in his ""Death"" Open Yale Course that we should hope there is no life after death because there is a finite amount of stuff to do and infinite heaven is actually infinite repetitive hell. Deutsch would disagree. I need to go back and re-read this book to really follow his reasoning though - it was a bit subtle.Another important claim Deutsch makes is that there is only one type of knowledge (that defined by rationality). Again, I'd have to re-read to really understand his logic, but the implications are equally profound. For example, Deutsch says that we should not fear the Singularity because an Artificial Intelligence is no different than human intelligence. We are both ""universal explainers"" and there is nothing that an AI could understand that humans could not. This position rings much truer to me than Bostrom's in his Superintelligence book.One of the major distinctions that Deutsch draws is that between ""static""/""sustainable""/""precautionary"" and ""dynamic"" societies. Static societies are those which adhere rigidly to traditional values and suppress creativity to maintain the status quo. On the other hand, dynamic societies encourage an atmosphere of creativity and criticism which leads to ongoing scientific progress and represents a ""beginning of infinity."" Deutsch is very pro-Westernization and is unabashedly critical of what he views as the repressive and miserable conditions of life in non-Western ""static"" societies.In that vein - Deutsch makes some very interesting comments about his environmental ethic. He sets up Jared Diamond (the Guns, Germs, and Steel guy) as his opposition. Diamond claims that the Easter Island civilization collapsed because of poor environmental management and the deforestation of their island. Deutsch agrees that that may have been the proximate cause of their demise, but that's like saying that ""Caesar died because of improper iron management"" when he got stabbed. Deutsch says that the real reason that Easter Island collapsed was because they were a static society that was unable to solve existential problems when they came up. Had they simply had the knowledge needed to reforest their island or make ocean-going voyages to relocate, their society would have survived. I've always had a tough time stomaching Diamond, and Deutsch puts his finger on the exact reason why. One of Deutsch's observations that I really liked was that with the correct knowledge, anything is possible unless it is prohibited by the laws of physics. In our own time, Deutsch recommends that we realize that there is no such thing as ""sustainability."" Things are sustainable until they're not. There will always be problems and we will always need to come up with new solutions.Incidentally, Deutsch also claims that we shouldn't worry about alien invasions either. If an alien civilization was advanced enough to build spaceships to reach our planet, we would likely understand each other very well because we would share much of the same knowledge (because there is only one type of knowledge). Furthermore, they would clearly be smart enough to teach us how to understand them and their technology (after all, they educate their own young). And there would be no need to mine the Earth for resources or any other classic sci-fi trope - the universe is so large that they could easily afford to leave us alone.Overall, this book forced me to think about a lot of different areas of life and the universe from a highly rational and integrating perspective. Still trying to figure out what I actually believe from this book... probably worth a re-read at some point in the future.Full review with highlights here: http://books.max-nova.com/the-beginning-of-infinity/"
15,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558868-michael-flick,1,"Dense and difficult and in the end unsatisfying. The two fundamental questions are ""How?"" and ""Why?"" The author addresses the first, the how question, which is the only question science can answer. He argues, not wholly persuasively, for infinite progress. He ignores the why question. And in so doing, he ignores the crucial question of what meaning there can possibly be, at least for people, in infinity. The answer is: ""none."" What gives meaning to human life is precisely finitude, not infinity (immortality). What gives life meaning is that whatever we do matters--we don't get even a second chance, let alone infinite chances. Were we immortal, nothing we did would matter at all--we could always just do it again and again and again. Think about it.This book is a prophecy. The author drums home repetitively that the future is not yet imaginable: the prophetic fallacy. That's a fool's errand and so is this book."
16,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7764315-mitesh,4,"I loved parts of this book and got some amazing insights. However, there were other parts, where I either did not understand what the author was trying to say fully or did not agree with the flow of reasoning. The best thing about it was a crystal-clear argument for optimism towards the future of humans. I liked the introduction to infinite set theory using the example of Infinity Hotel, a clever made-up tale of a dialogue between Socrates and Hermes on epistemology, plausible story for the evolution of numerals and definition of fungibility and its application to economics, physics and towards the description of Many Worlds theory. The explanation of beauty had me hooked. The other parts I probably couldn't digest in the first go.Overall, after high school (or 1st year engineering), I've never touched anything related to physics, and therefore, this was a great departure from my usual genres. That also means I can't really give an impartial and honest rating to this book as I do not have much to compare this with (the last good written book for Physics I read was by H.C. Verma, and it was meant to be a textbook).As the author repeats multiple times in the book, if humanity lives on for infinity, we will always be closer to the beginning of the infinity rather than towards the end (which doesn't exist)."
17,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1936154-timothy-warnock,5,"While I was, admittedly, turned off by the cover [worth mentioning here only because this book touches on a universal aesthetic], the ideas and perspectives offered in this book are incredible.Overall it was brilliant, challenging, and refreshing -- it addresses so wonderfully the questions and concerns I personally found unanswered in every philosophy of science or epistemology lecture I had ever attended.The author very beautifully connected mathematics, physics, politics, and art into a familiar worldview that I've never been able to articulate succinctly. In particular this provides the best explanation I've encountered for the scientific revolution and the acceleration of human-created technology and knowledge.I've yet to find a criticism of this book that wasn't either gushingly positive or fallaciously misrepresenting a specific point, or ignoring the content and calling the book boring and hard to read, which it kind of is...I fell asleep more than once while reading.Also, if you're going to read this, it would be useful to have a prerequisite background in at least academic philosophy (he dives deep into epistemology and answers criticisms of Fallibilism assuming the reader has been following epistemology debates). While I can't speak to his interpretation of quantum mechanics (I simply do not know enough to even offer an opinion), his overview of computer science and AI was spot on (and again, refreshing).The parts about politics were quite amazing and comparatively easy to understand.And I personally loved the section about art, creativity and a universal aesthetic -- I felt the larger context of infinite reach applies necessarily unto art and creativity (importantly and in no way different than physics or mathematics), but he seemed to lack the force and flagrant confidence in this area (at least compared to his views on physics and quantum mechanics).In other words, he's incredibly bold and confident discussing quantum mechanics but he seems to only flirt with a universal aesthetic; in particular the subject/object distinction where discussions of universal aesthetics tend to be unfortunately (and unnecessarily) confused. I would have liked if the author was as boldly challenging to concepts (and consequences) of art as he is discussing quantum mechanics."
18,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,5,"Expanding on the philosophy of Karl Popper, The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch is the definitive work of philosophy for the twenty-first century.I suspect that on first exposure it may not be entirely clear what the underlying message and philosophy is. The structure of the book, the chapter headings, and the frequent digressions will cause some readers to either abandon the book or miss the point. But for those that stick with it, and really absorb the lessons, the philosophy is powerful. While no single review can do the content of this book justice, for what it’s worth, here are the main points I took away from the book.In general, Deutsch is making the claim that knowledge and biological adaptation share a similar history of development (although they are much different in other important ways). In terms of biological adaptation, variation in genes results in different biological forms which are then selected via the process of natural selection. The information needed to assemble biological forms is contained within the genes. Likewise, knowledge evolves by variation, in the form of conjectures or explanations, about some phenomenon, which are then selected via traditions of criticism and experimentation. And so the process of variation and selection results in the evolution of both biological forms and knowledge. However, unlike biological evolution, knowledge is expressed in the form of explanations that have potentially infinite reach. For example, the theory of gravity is an explanation that can provide information about the farthest reaches of the universe despite the fact that we’ve never travelled there. Variation, in the form of conjectures, generates different explanations that can then be criticized and tested. But it’s only through a tradition of criticism and testing that knowledge can evolve to become more refined. And this fact explains the explosion of knowledge we’ve witness over the last 400 or so years since the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment, which included the scientific revolution, was characterized by a rejection of authority, dogma, and any system of belief that insulated itself against criticism and change. This insulation against criticism and change characterizes all failed societies and systems of thought. The new scientific sensibility, in contrast, took nothing for granted, and even treated its own theories as provisional, or subject to change in the face of new evidence or better explanatory theories. In this way, all knowledge is treated as conjecture, subject to the selection process of criticism and testing, allowing knowledge to grow and expand infinitely. In the process, we’ve come to discover the criteria for good explanations. The nature of our reason is that we can never know anything with complete certainty; our knowledge, as a result, must be probabilistic. But within that constraint we can develop explanations that are increasingly accurate and precise. Accuracy and precision are important standards in our evaluation of explanations; standards that are absent in bad explanations. For example, using creationism to explain biological adaptation is a bad explanation because to say that “God designed life” is really not explaining anything at all. It says nothing of the the nature of God, how God came into existence itself, and why specific adaptations were designed to the exclusion of others. More importantly, in bad explanations the details are easy to vary. The creationist, faced with any specific example of poor design in our own biology, can simply make up an explanation for its existence or make the claim that God is infinitely wiser than us, so that there must be a reason. This is the mark of a bad explanation: one that can never be wrong regardless of any new thought, criticism, discovery, evidence or testing procedure. Evolution, in contrast, represents a good explanation because it not only fits the evidence but the details are hard to vary. This means that evolution could be disproven by finding a fossil out of place, or by showing a biological adaptation that spontaneously generated without ancestral precursors. Within this entire epistemology is the concept of fallibilism, the importance of theory, and the importance of a system of criticism. Fallibilism is the principle that all of our theories, both scientific and based on common sense, are subject to varying degrees of doubt and so can never be conclusively proven. Even formal systems such as mathematics and logic cannot prove their own axioms from within their own systems and must rely on outside sources, ad infinitum. Every argument includes premises in support of a conclusion, but the premises themselves are left unargued. If those premises are then supported with further argument, then the premises for that argument are left unsupported.This results in an infinite regress and a permanent state of doubt, and the deeper our explanations go, the more questions arise. This is why problems are inevitable. But problems are also soluble, even if our knowledge is only probable. We can solve problems as they arise, but—and here’s another key point—we can’t know which problems are soluble before we solve them. That’s why premature cognitive closure is the antithesis to Deutsch’s theory; the resignation of problems as unsolvable, or of existing belief as certain, prevents the possibility of knowledge growth. Perhaps some problems are unsolvable, but since we don’t know which will be solved ahead of time, we must of practical necessity assume that they are. This will lead to the development of explanatory theories (variation), which can then be criticized and tested (selection). The theories that withstand the testing become the currently best explanations. And so a kind of evolutionary process is occurring within the mind.Theory and abstract explanations always proceed testing, as gene variation always precedes natural selection. That is because experimental data always needs to filtered and assessed according to some theory. The idea of empiricism, that observational data just spontaneously assembles itself into theory and knowledge, is patently false. Newton’s laws of universal motion, for example, cannot be derived simply from observing objects in motion. It is an explanatory theory that can be tested, but must be a theory first.This, in essence, is what I take to be the underlying philosophy of the book. It is a philosophy that replaces the search for certainty with the search for better explanations and unbounded growth in knowledge, which is a philosophy that can help humankind transition, once and for all, out of the dark ages. "
19,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28189390-lance-l,1,"This book seems like a clinic in logical fallacies. Every chapter is peppered with straw man attacks on rival scientists, false syllogisms, false analogies, and head-slapping non sequiturs. Argument against the Virtual Reality hypothesis: I believe that reality is knowable. In a virtual reality scenario, there would be no access to the underlying reality, so it wouldn't be knowable. So it can't be. For those keeping score, that's begging the question AND a false syllogism. The pages are just littered with such sloppiness. Which truly makes me wonder because I have great respect for the author and his work. This book was just not well-argued or rigorous or really even comprehensible at times (as could be said of this review - the author rambles off onto tangents and never finds his way back to the point). Extremely disappointing."

Understanding the root of dynamic versus static culture is crucial, and the closing refutation of Nick Bostrom's argument for simulations is so elegant. Worth putting on your shelf and working through slowly, and possibly the best inspiration for my fiction writing in some time."
21,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009670-scott,1,I always think I like the philosophy of positivism until I stare down its most self-absorbed authors and realize they just wish everything they say is true.
22,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,3,"This is a frustrating book, because I simultaneously agree with the conclusion and an entirely unimpressed with its argument. There is some great stuff here about the meaning of ""reality"" (things that are _real_ are those things that are involved in our best explanation for a phenomena), and it gives a good heuristic metric for the quality of arguments (good arguments are ones in which there are few-to-none variables which can be changed without affecting the outcome.) Also that people are relevant in the grand scheme of the universe, due to their engineering and scientific prowess to effect change. I liked all that stuff.What I didn't like was Deutsch's bad logic. He plays fast-and-loose with shaky metaphors, and generalizes their arguments back to the real world. For example, he takes issue with Haldane's quote that ""the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose."" I've always interpreted this as either ""the universe is infinite, and we are not, therefore we simply can't enumerate all thoughts about its queerness,"" or as ""something about our neural architecture makes us fundamentally blind to some of the universe's mysteries."" Analogously to the first case, it's uncomputable to choose an arbitrary real number --- there's simply too many of them to ever possibly find most of them.But this is all stupid, says Deutsch! He dismisses it metacircularly, saying that if the universe did have physically-possible but technically-impossible aspects, then ""this fact would itself be a testable regularly in nature. But all regularities in nature have explanations, so the explanation of that regularity would itself be a law of nature, or a consequence of one. And so, again, everything that is not forbidden by nature is achievable, given the right knowledge."" As is so often the case with physicists, philosophers, and traditional mathematicians, Deutsch is missing the capital-C Complexity issue of this problem. Just because something must have an answer doesn't mean it must be computable, which is to say, doesn't mean it is necessarily instantiable inside the universe. As an illustration, there is an answer to ""what is the quantum state of the universe,"" but the answer to that is too big to fit into the universe, other than _as the universe qua itself._ More generally, if a problem space grows too quickly, you simply can't expect to find an answer.Most of the book is Deutsch having interesting ideas with extremely weak justifications. It gives off the impression that he wants to talk about his (in my opinion, not-so) crazy beliefs, but feels that he ought to justify them first. But either he couldn't be fucked to give good justifications, or his entire thought process is needlessly muddy and if he's gotten to the right answers, its purely by coincidence. As someone who already agreed with his conclusion, I found myself put off by his arguments; they simply would not compel a disbeliever to start believing, nor do I think they hold much water even stripped of the rhetoric.All in all, I wanted to like this book, but put it down around 30% because Deutsch didn't seem to have a point, and his arguments were frustrating enough that I wasn't convinced I could trust him of anything novel he might have to show me tangentially."

Perpetually correcting misconceptions allows us to create unbounded knowledge. Problems are inevitable, but soluble. Optimism is the theory that all failures are due to insufficient knowledge, and has been the basis for our progress since the Enlightenment. It is ours to actively foster in the future.""The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say 'It is our duty to remain optimists,' this includes not only the openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the future holds in store.

24,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,3,"I am mixed in my reactions to this book. In some fundamental ways, I enjoyed the book very much and appreciate that the author is very smart, widely informed, and a terrific writer. I agree with the book's fundamental intent and was greatly stimulated by the exposition. On the other hand, I think that the author tries to do too much and that, as a result, the exposition is least compelling and the most problematic precisely at the points that are most critical to the book's argument. Overall, there is an overstretch here that ultimately detracts from the overall value of the book.The most attractive aspect of the book to me is the author's focus on Karl Popper's book ""Conjectures and Refutations"" as a central perspective for understanding the growth of knowledge through new discoveries and the eliminations of error. This is a very good idea and I heartily recommend that readers visit (or revisit) Popper and look at this book's story in light of Popper's arguments. Along the way while developing this idea, Deutsch goes through a tour of current issues in science and he is tremendously informative. I still do not understand quantum mechanics, despite his best efforts, and found that chapter the least accessible.Deutsch then applies Popper's arguments to theories of evolution, including his very informative discussion of neo-Darwinism. In doing this, he links Popper's processes of investigation and criticism with the effects of evolution in bringing organisms into line with the natural environment, even in the absence of human intervention and explanations. This is a critical link in the exposition and is very thought-provoking. Deutsch is particularly effective in comparing various possible explanations for natural phenomena. I am still processing this but retain an open mind.The next key link in the argument is that humans have left evolution behind and have continued developing (and an increasing rate) through cultural evolution. This involves a story of how critical sets of ideas circulate and get retained throughout human populations. This story directly links evolution with DNA and genes and evolution with cultural items and ideas. This is a much more difficult argument to accept and yet it is crucial for the overall case. The author at several points in the book argues against careless analogies, yet that is what appears to be going on here. Even if I accepted the story line, which I am having trouble doing, the story does not strike me as doing justice to the complexity involved in mass civilization and its complex structure of groups and institutions. Deutch's story seems simplistic and even reductionist when faced with the complexity of contemporary society and the economy. The same issues arise for me in considering his criticisms of voting studies and social choice theories. The author seems to be down on dictators but someone who ""gets it"" will need to make the necessary choices if processes of social organization cannot be counted upon. Perhaps I missed something, but it is not clear in the exposition.Deutsch then goes into a study of aesthetics and beauty. This is really interesting stuff, but I still am having trouble seeing how Popper works in here. The discussion on creativity is more troubling. Creativity is necessary as an explanation of how memes get fine tuned to particular situations, yet precious little in the way of definition is provided to be clear on what is going on. Without more clarity, creativity seems more like a theoretical plug rather than an answer.Deutsch enshrines optimism and greatly dislikes ""prophecy"" in which scientists close of future prospects and declare a dismal and dangerous future. Bravo for him on this! The trouble is that he continues with his own ramblings. This confirms my principle that most books end up being a chapter or two too long.Overall, I enjoyed the book and greatly appreciate the restatement and application of Popper to the topics of the book. It would have been good if Deutsch had exercised the same humility in this exposition that he counsels others to display. That would have led to a more effective book."
25,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5671213-thore-husfeldt,5,"My mind is blown. As close to a unified theory of everything as it gets. And an optimistic, bold, and lucid opportunity to change you mind about a lot of things.You thought science is a method for producing correct or useful statements? That we should prevent falsehoods from being formulated in the scientific community? That we derive explanations from sensory experience? You believe in inductivism? Logical positivism? That claims are scientific if they are testable? That the Turing test is good? That evolution maximises good of the species? That the mindset behind sustainable development is a good thing? That the function of voting is to elect the leaders or ideas that are best or most accurately represent the desires of the electorate? That coalition-building and compromise in a parliamentary democracy are morally and operationally superior to undiluted two-party dichotomy? That the goal of mathematics is proof (and in a finite proof system!)? That there is no objective way to judge art? That AI is impossible? That we are insignificant and should not submit the world endlessly to our depredations? That we’ve basically found out everything there is no learn about reality? That problems can (and should) be avoided through careful planning? That Jared Diamond’s book(s) are right? Etc., etc.Well, you were wrong. (So was I.) And you were wrong for reasons that Deutsch manages to distill into a very neat theory building on definitions of knowledge, explanation, reach, and people (universal explainers, which includes homo sapiens) that were new to me (but maybe shouldn’t if I had read my Popper diligently and thought very hard). This book looks at the processes with which knowledge is built, which includes knowledge in the form of genes (built by Darwinian evolution) and knowledge in the form of behaviours or scientific theories (built by the interaction of people.) As a consequence, a large number of deeply held convictions (of mine) are vaporised—I had to put the book down maybe a dozen times while I could feel my mind rearranging itself. Fantastic.Some questions I didn’t even know I had: Why has homo developed creativity (problem solving, intelligence, social structures to promote them) without ever using it? The history of mankind is a pitiful sequence of failing to get or act on good ideas, despite the obvious evolutionary advantage (and relative ease) of inventing, say, a better axe. Yet today we have that trait. So how did it evolve, if it was (obviously, from historic record) not selected for? This is a real mystery. Answered in the book, of course.Apart from these illuminating, provocative, and stupendously convincing explanations, the book is incredibly optimistic. But not mindlessly so: Among other things, the book does a splendid job at describing the kind of mindset and society that would allow us to leverage our universal reach (Popper’s “open society”, the European Enlightenment, Athens, Florence of the Medici), and also what we could do wrong (“the static society,” which is the default mode of human organisation, deeply ingrained in our psychology and environment of evolutionary adaptation, with its taboos, rituals, consensus, groupthink, authoritarianism, censorship, etc.) In that sense, the book is also political in that it gives implicit but operational rules of thumb for how to behave. The project of finding good “knowledge” (such as Newtonian physics, women’s liberation, or a Mozart sonata) is a moral and a political project. The current Enlightenment is ours to destroy, and we know exactly how.(Bad parts: The wonky parts of the book are just wonky. And it’s not very scholarly—I’d have preferred a rich set of endnotes, curated further reading, and a ton of footnotes.)"

27,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693283-terry-pearce,5,"This book is astoundingly good. Definitely the best non-fiction I've read since Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Maybe better, even. Deutsch starts with explanations being the basis for knowledge, and builds up basic, hard-to-argue-with principles into convincing monoliths that smash some conventional interpretations of knowledge, science and philosophy to tiny pieces. He gives the most understandable insight I've yet had into quantum physics and in particularly the many universes theory, and he has this way of taking on giants (like Dawkins, Jared Diamond, half the current interpreters of quantum theory, and many more besides) with unshakable doggedness and in most cases bringing me round. His breadth is amazing -- he talks about AI, the history of science and philosophy, maths, science fiction, cosmology, the nature of intelligence, prediction, quantum theory, SETI, the nature of truth in 'soft' subjects, policymaking and government... I'm not sure I 100% agree with everything here -- like many with a central idea I wonder if he connects it too far, or ignores other factors sometimes, but he has changed and challenged my thinking on a number of issues, and helped me better understand what good science is all about. The narration is one of the best I've come across as well -- really clear and engaging."
28,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu,5,"An awesome book and as perfect explanation of ""natural philosophy"" for the 21st century as it gets; while I hold powerfully with almost all of the book's theses, I never could explain them as clearly as the author does - this is a must read for anyone interested in both the ""big things"" and how understanding and explanation - the main leg of we call progress - are so powerful that they have literally changed the world in 2-3 centuries more than pretty much in all its history, that they accelerate and constitute the only antidote for the current or future problems that will (inevitably) appear and also incidentally how persons - of which humans are the one known example so far - are crucial to the life of the universe "
29,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"""Covers nothing to everything""One of my favorite books and provided me with many insights into our place in the universe and how we know the things we know. Deutsch explains the very small to the very large. He provides a reasonable explanation of the measurement problem in physics and a consistent theory on multiple universes. His survey of different schools of philosophies is one of the best I've read. He even has a detailed chapter on developing the most efficient election process which doesn't fully fit the theme of the book, but he explains it so well it becomes an intriguing chapter.After reading the book, you will have an appreciation for the infinity and understand what is meant by 'everything possible will happen with certainty""."
30,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."
31,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15005782-nancy-mckinley,2,"A few gifted writers can take any subject and breathe life into it, even a subject such as the all- elusive (at least to me)Physics. Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited. I don't know how anyone could get so far and be so bright and fail to include this. Something to learn from, I suppose. "
32,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3205699-kim,2,"There is basically one single good idea in this book. It's a good one, and I liked it, and it's an idea that hadn't been explicit for me before, but basically the whole book can be summarized in two words: GOOD EXPLANATIONS. So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
33,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
34,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
35,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
36,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."
37,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52278486-bryan,2,"This book covers some interesting ideas about knowledge, the propagation of ideas, and quantum physics. It uses a ""good explanation"" framework to evaluate different perspectives, propose thought experiments, and ultimately espouse a rationally optimistic view of the future. Unfortunately, though, the writing is dry so much of this comes off as simply boring intellectual masturbation. Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."
38,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15859176-cody-lasko,5,"I’ll be coming back to this one in the future. What a ride. Simultaneously entertaining and enlightening, this is a phenomenal deconstruction of exactly what it intends to do: explain our reality. Lofty goal. Exceptional execution. Highly recommend this to anyone that seeks an understanding of the world and the universe we live in from a scientific perspective. And just like me, you don’t have to have a degree in rocket appliances to get a bit of learning in whilst doing so! Splendid indeed!"
39,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10968678-jaber,5,"A brilliant book that tackles fundamental questions in an elegant rational manner. It discusses philosophy of science, knowledge creation, optimism and the reach of ideas, memes, societies and the Enlightenment, and even ethics and beauty.

40,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108940757-saketh-nimmagadda,5,One of the rare books that has changed my perspective on nearly everything
41,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
42,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
43,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
44,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
45,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
46,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
47,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
48,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
49,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
50,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
51,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
52,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
53,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
54,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
55,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
56,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
57,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
58,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
59,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
60,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited.

It's a good one, and I liked it, and it's an idea that hadn't been explicit for me before, but basically the whole book can be summarized in two words: GOOD EXPLANATIONS. So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
63,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
64,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
65,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
66,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

70,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108940757-saketh-nimmagadda,5,One of the rare books that has changed my perspective on nearly everything
71,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
72,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
73,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
74,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
75,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
76,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
77,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
78,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
79,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
80,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
81,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
82,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
83,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
84,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
85,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
86,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
87,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
88,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
89,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
90,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited. I don't know how anyone could get so far and be so bright and fail to include this. Something to learn from, I suppose. "

It's a good one, and I liked it, and it's an idea that hadn't been explicit for me before, but basically the whole book can be summarized in two words: GOOD EXPLANATIONS. So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
93,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
94,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
95,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
96,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

100,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108940757-saketh-nimmagadda,5,One of the rare books that has changed my perspective on nearly everything
101,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
102,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
103,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
104,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
105,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
106,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
107,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
108,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
109,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
110,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
111,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
112,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
113,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
114,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
115,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
116,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
117,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
118,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
119,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
120,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited. I don't know how anyone could get so far and be so bright and fail to include this. Something to learn from, I suppose. "

So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
123,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
124,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
125,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
126,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

131,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
132,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
133,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
134,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
135,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
136,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
137,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
138,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
139,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
140,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
141,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
142,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
143,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
144,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
145,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
146,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
147,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
148,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
149,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
150,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited.

So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
153,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
154,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
155,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
156,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

161,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
162,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
163,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
164,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
165,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
166,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
167,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
168,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal.

169,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
170,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
171,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
172,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
173,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
174,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
175,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
176,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
177,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
178,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
179,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
180,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited.

So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
183,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
184,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
185,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
186,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

It uses a ""good explanation"" framework to evaluate different perspectives, propose thought experiments, and ultimately espouse a rationally optimistic view of the future. Unfortunately, though, the writing is dry so much of this comes off as simply boring intellectual masturbation. Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

Simultaneously entertaining and enlightening, this is a phenomenal deconstruction of exactly what it intends to do: explain our reality. Lofty goal. Exceptional execution. Highly recommend this to anyone that seeks an understanding of the world and the universe we live in from a scientific perspective. And just like me, you don’t have to have a degree in rocket appliances to get a bit of learning in whilst doing so! Splendid indeed!"

191,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
192,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
193,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
194,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
195,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
196,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
197,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"

The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
199,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
200,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
201,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
202,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
203,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
204,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
205,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
206,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
207,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
208,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."
209,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10971047-daniel,5,"Absolutely mind blowing.I love stuff like this. Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."

I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

213,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
214,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
215,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
216,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

It uses a ""good explanation"" framework to evaluate different perspectives, propose thought experiments, and ultimately espouse a rationally optimistic view of the future. Unfortunately, though, the writing is dry so much of this comes off as simply boring intellectual masturbation. Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

Simultaneously entertaining and enlightening, this is a phenomenal deconstruction of exactly what it intends to do: explain our reality. Lofty goal. Exceptional execution.

And just like me, you don’t have to have a degree in rocket appliances to get a bit of learning in whilst doing so! Splendid indeed!"

221,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
222,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."
223,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,4,"“We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
224,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
225,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
226,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
227,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
228,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
229,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
230,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
231,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
232,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
233,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
234,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
235,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
236,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
237,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"

Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."

Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."

I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind.

But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
244,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
245,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
246,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."
247,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52278486-bryan,2,"This book covers some interesting ideas about knowledge, the propagation of ideas, and quantum physics. It uses a ""good explanation"" framework to evaluate different perspectives, propose thought experiments, and ultimately espouse a rationally optimistic view of the future. Unfortunately, though, the writing is dry so much of this comes off as simply boring intellectual masturbation. Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

Simultaneously entertaining and enlightening, this is a phenomenal deconstruction of exactly what it intends to do: explain our reality. Lofty goal. Exceptional execution. Highly recommend this to anyone that seeks an understanding of the world and the universe we live in from a scientific perspective. And just like me, you don’t have to have a degree in rocket appliances to get a bit of learning in whilst doing so! Splendid indeed!"

250,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108940757-saketh-nimmagadda,5,One of the rare books that has changed my perspective on nearly everything
251,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
252,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."

All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
254,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
255,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
256,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
257,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
258,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
259,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
260,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
261,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
262,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
263,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
264,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
265,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
266,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "
267,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4544890-vlad,4,"Deutsch really really really likes the word ""parochial"". The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"
268,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781329-susan-clark-cook,5,"This is a fascinating look at how we make progress as humans and as a society. Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."

Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
270,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910716-terry-tsurugi,5,"Even though I disagree with many of Deutsch's ideas, I consider this book well worth reading and discussing. I see Deutsch's position as a radically conservative kind of heroic, optimistic realism rebelling against two dominate poles of western discourse: empiricism/pragmatism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other hand. He believes in physical reality, creativity, beauty, and progress, even though he requires a multiverse to support these things. He actually changed my mind about several things, but some of his arguments I find unconvincing, like his explanation of memes for example.-------------------That was what I thought in 2011 when I first read this book, but after reading it again in 2016, I've changed my mind. Now I find his arguments totally convincing."

Brian Greene is a artist who excels at this and it is no simple feat. The writer of this particular book: ""The Beginning of Infinity"" is no Brian Greene by a long shot but then besides Mr. Greene, who is?I must take a snipe at the fact there are no notes or sources cited. I don't know how anyone could get so far and be so bright and fail to include this. Something to learn from, I suppose. "

It's a good one, and I liked it, and it's an idea that hadn't been explicit for me before, but basically the whole book can be summarized in two words: GOOD EXPLANATIONS. So there was really no need for it to be as long as it was. For example, I have NEVER seen exposition of the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics that was not only so excruciatingly long, but also full of ridiculous tangents.-Phil"
273,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Philosophical science book in the vein of Hofstadter or Dawkins. Deutsch is a brilliant guy (a physics professor at Oxford) who's keen on Everett's many world explanation, subject of Sean Carroll's recent book Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime. But this book is really a theory of everything: culture, politics, aesthetics and epistemology all fall under Deutsch's central idea of humans being universal replicators who can achieve infinitely, by the property of being error correctingTowards the end Deutsch specifically argues against Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, taking as an example Diamond's argument about America not developing advanced civilisation because it didn't have pack animals - except for llamas, which are only in the Andes. The argument was used almost identically by Engels 113 years earlier, and doesn't even make sense (so shouldn't the Andes dwellers have developed civilization?), yet Diamond seizes on it because, in his view, the alternative is simple racism. Diamond ""just takes it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist, dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another"".For Deutsch advocates a sort of Borlaugism in the sense of  The Wizard and the Prophet. The idea of sustainability is stupid, he says, since no lifestyle is ultimately sustainable, and one which was would be devoid of growth or intellectual progress (there is a common environmentalist myth of premodern societies living in harmony with nature, rather than rapacious and disastrous environmental destruction such as that which turned the Fertile Crescent to near-desert). So much wasteful argument is had about how much of climate change is anthropogenic, (imagine if only hurricanes caused by people concerned us); and how to reduce emissions instead of how to mitigate then or adapt to warmer climate. Sustainability is only a temporary mirage. He calls out Paul Ehrlich and The Population Bomb, who assumed that problems could never be solved, only shrunk from. The disaster Ehrlich predicted has yet to occur. (I still think recycling and reducing waste is worthwhile, though; since even if we ultimately need to keep innovating it buys us more time and better quality of life until progress is made!)Deutsch is something of the know it all egghead, and a great example is his quote of this story about Dawkins (another prize specimen): My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.Deutsch quotes this in order to one up it with a ""well actually"": in fact he thinks that the ""objective"" beauty of the flowers is for our sake! one might think his attempts to explain poetry, art and politics a bit of a stretch. But tracking a mind like his across a massive range of topics - even if I didn't always follow - still felt rewarding, challenging, and mind-fatiguing in the best way."
274,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68216674-pantelis-pipergias-analytis,4,"David Deutsch delivers a fascinating discussion of topics ranging from philosophy of science, quantum theory and aesthetics to history, cultural evolution and social choice. A well-rounded and imaginative thinker, Deutsch writes in an engaging and entertaining manner. Some parts of the book are, unavoidably, better informed and more original than others. The discussion of empiricism vs. Popperian philosophy of science, for instance, is very well delivered. Similarly, the chapter on multiverses is mind-boggling and reads like science-fiction. On the flip-side, there are chapters where Deutsch is missing out on recent scientific developments. For instance, the chapter on cultural evolution is relatively shallow and focuses on memes, whereas there have been 3 decades of theoretical and experimental work on innovation, social learning and cultural evolution in humans and other animals. Similarly the arguments he makes in the chapter on social choice are in my opinion based on tenuous assumptions. Overall, it is was an enjoyable read, as even in the weak chapters, Deutsch demonstrates great story-telling and synthetic skills, and he provides a fresh perspective that is worth thinking about and arguing against."
275,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,5,"This is a tremendously long book which is heavy on science, philosophy and other topics. Reading it is a mental workout, and there were periods where I put it down for a couple months. However, this book was a fascinating read and was well work the mental work. Here are some reasons why. - Deutsch is one of the key contributors to the physics underlying quantum computers. Again his discussion on it is complex but fascinating. - The concept of universality is built throughout the book and relates to number, letters, computers, cultures and ultimately humans. These discussions are intricate, but his progression and explanation make it accessible and interesting. - his definition of “Optimism” and what it can do in a culture was both inspiring and revelatory. His comparison of Greece and Sparta really nailed it. - The most interesting part of the book was the discussion of memes or “stories that persist”. This is essentially culture whether religion, science or even pure stories. His philosophical framework is worth reading the whole book for. Obviously I enjoyed the book. He is critical of religion much like Dawkins or others would be. For people of faith, this can grate on ones nerves, but any annoyance is outweighed by the ideas in this book. "
276,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8994743-bernardo,4,"It's deep dive into big questions on human existence and progress. I enjoyed the technical, academic approach into themes like evolution, culture, philosophy, the physics of it all, and its core theme: knowledge. It's not always explicit in the text, but it also touches very relevant subjects nowadays like climate change, energy, religion and even social media. Added to more scientific ones like quantum physics, biology and mathematics.Not an easy read, as it sometimes dives too much into technicals and rationalizations that make the text feel like it's questioning even its own arguments. However, even if there's some harder chapters, there are many mind-bending and very relatable ones. For me in particular: ""Optimism"", ""Unsustainable"", ""The Spark"" and ""The Evolution of Culture"". The stronger argument (and mostly central theme of the book) is that humans, after several historical attempts to enter the state of an ever increasing snowball of knowledge, are currently favoring a society that's increasingly open to change through constant conjecture and criticism of its own knowledge. We are now culturally seeking good explanations more and more. Explanations strong enough that are very hard to be refuted, and these come from the rationalizations of science. As long as there aren't any proven physical laws preventing it, infinity of existence is merely blocked by a lack of knowledge. Which is a solvable problem.A special mention to the ""A Dream of Socrates"" chapter, which I was able to relate to deeply. It covers a back-and-forth conversation (probably fictional) between Socrates and Apollo on the pointlessness of thinking we should ever achieve certainty in our beliefs and how much of an interesting life it is to simply seek truth on how the world works."

Unfortunately, though, the writing is dry so much of this comes off as simply boring intellectual masturbation. Only recommended to those who enjoyed Deutsch's other works and/or those with a keen interest in the subject matter."

280,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108940757-saketh-nimmagadda,5,One of the rare books that has changed my perspective on nearly everything
281,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Truly remarkable book which will very likely change your view of the world, it did mine. I first heard of Deutsch on a podcast talking about objective truths of morality, and then looked into his books. He is one of the most profound objective thinkers out there, and certainly one of the most thoughtful, rational, clearest thinkers alive. Thinking big with big ideas, Deutsch is perhaps the guy. He is the pioneer of the field of quantum computation, but is overall one of the most fascinating thinkers I’ve come across.This book took me a few months to read in part because of it’s beastly depth, but also in part due to my travels and sporadic schedule over the last couple months. The book puts forward the best argument I’ve seen for science, progress, and knowledge - science being simply good explanations that are hard to vary. The overall premise is that within the bounds of physics, knowledge is infinite. Any problem can be solved if it is physically possible, and the only barrier is knowledge to solve it. And with each solved problem, another problem arises. And with more knowledge comes more knowledge - the beginning of infinity. He discusses how the Enlightenment came to be, and how it radically changed the world. Every society before has been static, but we’re in the first societal age where we aren’t static and also haven’t destroyed ourselves (yet).His section on quantum mechanics was fascinating, but I thought a bit long. While much of the book was fascinating, there were parts which I thought were longer than need be and hence the 4 star rating. If you like contemplating our existence, understanding scientific and human knowledge, being enlightened to objective views about reality, and interested in this beginning of infinity idea, this a great book to read. It’s one I’d recommend to pretty much anyone.“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”“The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.”“we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered.”“Never before in the history of human thought has it been so obvious that our knowledge is tiny and our ignorance vast.”Some of my highlights/notes from the book:- The physical world is not only much bigger and more violent than it once seemed, it is also immensely richer in detail, diversity and incident. Yet it all proceeds according to elegant laws of physics that we understand in some depth. I do not know which is more awesome: the phenomena themselves or the fact that we know so much about them.- How do we know? One of the most remarkable things about science is the contrast between the enormous reach and power of our best theories and the precarious, local means by which we create them. No human has ever been at the surface of a star, let alone visited the core where the transmutation happens and the energy is produced. Yet we see those cold dots in our sky and know that we are looking at the white-hot surfaces of distant nuclear furnaces. Physically, that experience consists of nothing other than our brains responding to electrical impulses from our eyes. And eyes can detect only light that is inside them at the time. The fact that the light was emitted very far away and long ago, and that much more was happening there than just the emission of light – those are not things that we see. We know them only from theory. Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves. Where do these theories come from? For most of the history of science, it was mistakenly believed that we ‘derive’ them from the evidence of our senses – a philosophical doctrine known as empiricism.- But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.- We do know of sporadic traditions of good-explanation-seeking in narrowly defined fields, such as geometry, and even short-lived traditions of criticism – mini-enlightenments. But the sea change in the values and patterns of thinking of a whole community of thinkers, which brought about a sustained and accelerating creation of knowledge, happened only once in history, with the Enlightenment and its scientific revolution. An entire political, moral, economic and intellectual culture – roughly what is now called ‘the West’ – grew around the values entailed by the quest for good explanations, such as tolerance of dissent, openness to change, distrust of dogmatism and authority, and the aspiration to progress both by individuals and for the culture as a whole. - Some people become depressed at the scale of the universe, because it makes them feel insignificant. Other people are relieved to feel insignificant, which is even worse. But, in any case, those are mistakes. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.- It may seem strange that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it. But we observe nothing directly anyway. All observation is theory-laden. Likewise, whenever we make an error, it is an error in the explanation of something. That is why appearances can be deceptive, and it is also why we, and our instruments, can correct for that deceptiveness.- Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a (somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about 80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’, which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call ‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too faint for our eyes to detect. Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either.- The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7 degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about 270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves. Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin – except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from typical. - Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on.- The deeper an explanation is, the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy: no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives can continue to improve indefinitely.- It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them. It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for it; but it is in principle accessible to us. - Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves.- …at present during any given century there is about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event than a car accident.- The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.- Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were present who knew how to do that.- A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. - Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.- Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have no useful function at all.- If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock. Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.- Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some, albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the population. Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.- The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot. The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region of spacetime. - But it is no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking good explanations. - … even in science, almost all rejected theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism is correspondingly effective.- This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. - Today, your washing machine is almost certainly controlled by a computer that could be programmed to do astrophysics or word processing instead, if it were given suitable input–output devices and enough memory to hold the necessary data.- All knowledge growth is by incremental improvement, but in many fields there comes a point when one of the incremental improvements in a system of knowledge or technology causes a sudden increase in reach, making it a universal system in the relevant domain. In the past, innovators who brought about such a jump to universality had rarely been seeking it, but since the Enlightenment they have been, and universal explanations have been valued both for their own sake and for their usefulness.- Now known as the Turing test, it is simply that a suitable (human) judge be unable to tell whether the program is human or not.- We can understand infinity through the infinite reach of some explanations. It makes sense, both in mathematics and in physics. But it has counter-intuitive properties.One of them is that. If unlimited progress really is going to happen, not only are we now at almost the very beginning of it, we always shall be. - The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.- Just as no one in 1900 could have foreseen the consequences of innovations made during the twentieth century – including whole new fields such as nuclear physics, computer science and biotechnology – so our own future will be shaped by knowledge that we do not yet have. We cannot even predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all. No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome, of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with it.- Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation.- Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not even fossils exist. - Bad philosophy   Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation   - To choose an option, rationally, is to choose the associated explanation. Therefore, rational decision-making consists not of weighing evidence but of explaining it, in the course of explaining the world. One judges arguments as explanations, not justifications, and one does this creatively, using conjecture, tempered by every kind of criticism. It is in the nature of good explanations – being hard to vary – that there is only one of them. Having created it, one is no longer tempted by the alternatives. - But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations, we are faced with discrete options.- So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths.- Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our personal preferences and our biological make-up.I've run out of characters, to see the full review, go ahead and look here: https://goo.gl/W7Giqb"
282,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,5,"My comments stem from one aspect of the book which resonated with me, but it is by no means the sole theme presented. One design feature I found especially useful is located at the end of each chapter: where Deutsch gives a mini-glossary of important terms introduced in that chapter, recapitulates the new layer of meaning applied to its title phrase, ""the beginning of infinity"" which was explored therein, and finally offers a brief summary of the message the chapter sought to convey. I think this makes it useful almost as a reference book for the rich ideas it contains, and I really which more serious adult non-fiction authors applied it. It will be of great benefit to any student taking a course which includes the book in its readings. I hope these courses do or will exist! I think this book is so important, that if you cannot take the time to thoughtfully digest all of its some 500 pages, you could get the goods simply by reading each of these end-of-chapter summaries and declaring the job done. However, I think most who try that will be soon drawn in and found backing up to fully read the text as soon as they're able. This would be a wonderful thing, but I would be very increased in optimism even if the short-cut approach was all that could be spared by most.So, as you've guessed by now I think this is an excellent book! If I could set a high-school curriculum to ensure exposure to certain topics, it would include this book definitely. Its lessons would serve as a much-needed inoculation to anthropic and parochial modes of thinking (i.e. mistaking appearances for reality, with human-centered bias) which dominated human societies before The Enlightenment. Such modes are always present, and enjoyment of our current Enlightenment is imperiled by the prospect of backsliding led by some convicted number to refocus on such old, bad ideas as if they were some new way to live.Especially in our present Twitter and Facebook-driven era of seemingly non-stop reporting on various outrages and the call to rally to an ever present state of alarm about things, this book will capture your attention in hopes of convincing you that adopting a pessimistic outlook in response amounts to an error in thinking. It would be a callback to eras before the birth and gift of our present enlightenment; a failure to recognize that the real value in humanity is that we're creative.We are ""universal explainers"" and this power to use our creativity to develop good explanations for things in our world (good defined as being hard to vary without revealing the explanation is not true). With systems of thought such as science to test these explanations, revealing errors to correct, our explanatory creativity and the knowledge this generates is the centerpiece of what will ultimately decide whether humanity can continue to sustain itself. It won't be how hard you struggle to ""go green"" (or any number of other, similar parochial ideas) that will make the difference. It will be how good we can become at solving the inevitable problems that appear as we succeed in solving the problems currently at hand; how good we are at recognizing when our prevailing explanations are in error and applying our creativity to discover better ones.By Chapter 2, Deutsch has given enough background that some fundamental principles can be derived, which he figuratively carves in stone: problems are inevitable; problems are soluble. He means that with any problem, having the right knowledge would solve it. Every problem then, is rendered back to a problem of lack of knowledge.The earth once only sustained a few thousands of humans, later and for much longer only a few millions. It couldn't then sustain today's seven billion, because we didn't know how to make it do that. Today we do (so far), and this is the population we now have. Could it sustain more? Some argue that it cannot sustain what we have already. And if we freeze ourselves to our present behavior and limit of knowledge, I might agree. Certainly, ultimately, it could not then continue to sustain our present population. But it is just a knowledge problem. If Norman Borlaug 1914-2009 had not lived, today's earth would not yet be capable of sustaining the seven billion it today does! Get it? ...and so on forever.A fundamental implication of the book is brightly illustrated in Chapter 17 - Unsustainable. If you could only read one chapter from the book, I think this one should be it.Here Deutsch gives us two analyses of the the people of Easter Island, land of the famously impenetrable human statues. One comes from Jacob Bronowski's 1973 documentary series ""The Ascent of Man""; the other comes from famous naturalist David Attenborough, in his 2000 BBC documentary, ""State of the Planet"". While Attenborough used Easter Island as a warning, describing it as a ""miniature world that had ample resources to sustain"" the human society which had developed there, Bronowski went there to try to understand why, if things were so good, when faced with problems, their society could think of nothing better to do in trying to solve them than to just build ever more of those identically stupefied staring statues, only faster! The islanders, faced with environmental problems, had a potential solution: appeal to the spirits of their ancestors with these statues. But, being a static society they had no mechanism to identify and correct errors in this thinking: if the statues aren't working, build more; if that's not enough, hasten to build even more. Apparently, no one was ever given leave to think ""outside the box"" to pursue solutions through alternative living strategies, technologies, transportation, or trade.Bronowski sees a powerful ironic lesson which Deutsch thinks Attenborough missed, and Deutsch takes pains to clearly illustrate for readers as he discusses the critical differences between ""sustainable"" static societies, like the one on Easter Island, and ""unsustainable"" dynamic societies, such as ours since the Enlightenment. He notes while doing so that even the term sustain has two meanings which are often confused, and this is telling since the two are almost opposites: 1) to provide someone with what is needed, 2) to prevent things from changing.Other Stone Age societies faced challenges of similar impact, and they met them by progressing in agriculture and aquaculture. Yet, the Easter Islanders couldn't stop wasting their efforts on pointless monument-building (not even to be creative in the monuments' form, they're all characteristically the same). The book points out that Easter Islanders must have started to starve even before the fall of their society. While Attenborough initially called it sustainable because it was founded on a ""miniature world"" and they ""lived well"" at first, then changes occurred and it stopped sustaining them. For Attenborough, the statues were a vivid artistic mark of success. But, signaled by their incessant sameness and prolific number, to Bronowski they were evidence of the failure of the static society which made them. The people could not adapt.Bronowski's was in 1973, Attenborough's was in 2000. And the difference in their perspectives illustrates that the Enlightenment from which we are still reaping benefits is perhaps always going to be vulnerable to a retrenchment of old, static, patterns of thinking. It is the famous misapprehension of Thomas Malthus. And I've developed my thinking enough to be able to play a game of spotting it in others, whom in my mind's eye receive from me the label: neo-malthusian. With many neo-malthusians ideas floating around our culture, a terrifying lot of them think the proper way forward is for humanity to voluntarily die off. The reality is that there is no specific level of human population the planet can absolutely sustain. Our evidence seems to be that at some points earth appeared capable of sustaining only a hundred-thousand or so of our numbers. The truth is that what makes earth capable of sustaining us is our knowledge about how to act to use it to live, first embodied in our biology and in our genes, and now vastly more importantly embodied in our recorded and communicated ideas.Deutsch illustrates that no state is sustainable. Even if we were to live ""sustainably"" perfectly well in our present environment, this would only persist so long as nothing in that environment ever changes. We might strive not to change, but the wide environment will always be changing, and we will be left like the Easter Islanders if we fail to instead investigate our environment, build knowledge, and work to adapt. Eventually, our sun will consume earth. Before this, another mass-extinction-provoking asteroid will be discovered (or not) on a collision course with earth. Only by valuing knowledge and creativity and striving to build the wealthiest society we can manage, will we have the best opportunity to react to actively counter such threats. In this way, we have no choice but to embrace the dynamic society brought through Enlightenment values. If we backslide to a static ""sustainable"" mode, we'll be perfectly fine until our environment faces new changes. It won't matter whether those changes are precipitated primarily through our own behaviors or through external phenomena, at that point we would die like the Easter Islanders did (and in essentially the same way too, stuck in our static behaviors).In recent months I've seen his TEDtalk and caught some media interviews given by Steven Pinker for his new book, ""Enlightenment Now"". While written in 2011, this book fits neatly with such newcomers as Pinker's. I suppose one could take this book as explaining the overarching significance of the transformations of human thinking which (finally, after many false starts, some of which Deutsch documents) successfully established themselves in a lasting way only recently, during the Enlightenment era. Meanwhile Pinker's book is a survey showing how the power of these ideas have already transformed human societies profoundly for the better, nevermind what the evening news is saying.This title is worth your time."

All observations are, as Popper put it, theory-laden, * and hence fallible, as all our theories are. Consider the nerve signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and ‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.”“What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids, liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars. You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as far out as that, deep in intergalactic space. What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly pressurized.) And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry. No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next, and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction the story would be the same. Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense. The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly take us back out into intergalactic space.”“We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth, any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live. Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies (including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal constructors’.”“The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality: Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on…In fact such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You] would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.”“n the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance). Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations. For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’ No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good person, a good society, and so on. Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil – made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life. And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately, one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories, denials of history, and so on. Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate. We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.”“I think we have to face the fact, both with artificial evolution and with AI, that these are hard problems. There are serious unknowns in how those phenomena were achieved in nature. Trying to achieve them artificially without ever discovering those unknowns was perhaps worth trying. But it should be no surprise that it has failed. Specifically, we do not know why the DNA code, which evolved to describe bacteria, has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. And, although it seems obvious that an AI will have qualia and consciousness, we cannot explain those things. So long as we cannot explain them, how can we expect to simulate them in a computer program? Or why should they emerge effortlessly from projects designed to achieve something else? But my guess is that when we do understand them, artificially implementing evolution and intelligence and its constellation of associated attributes will then be no great effort.”“A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding colour, at several times he cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’. That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours. That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display, while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on, nightmare built upon nightmare. I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were, what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not: it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties to suit our convenience? I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light. No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour televisions, then there was no alternative. Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels, why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so close to a point that happened to have significance for human technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to violate the Principle of Mediocrity. What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history. He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount. Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception, they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are – which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers: creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the cure. Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.”"
284,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745592-jay,3," Theoretical physicist David Deutsch presents us with an onslaught of ideas. The Beginning of Infinity is an attempt at combining various branches of science with the branch of philosophical epistemology. While a wide range of explication and analysis is contained here, the quality of his ideas shifts from good to bad and back again.  The core idea of this book is that humans are a unique species of beings on our planet and what makes us unique is our ability to generate knowledge; what makes this knowledge so significant is that we create explanations and because of this ability, problem solving has become the skill that ensures our chances of survival as well as the capacity to make infinite progress in our ability to understand. Every advance in knowledge is a beginning of infinity, an entryway into a string of continuously improving explanations of what reality is. This process starts with statements of conjecture that get analyzed and modified; every problem that gets solved leads to a giant leap in knowledge but also opens us up to new problems as well, in an infinite series of solutions and dilemmas that can never be complete. Europe’s Age of Enlightenment saw the beginning of an explosion of science and rationality that is still in the process of unfolding now.  The importance of forming explanations is at the core of this core idea. Explanations can be good or bad and scientific knowledge advances when bad explanations are replaces by good explanations. Examples of bad explanations are mystical or religious forms of causality, vague or inaccurate observations, and the conflation of ideas that have no bearing or relation on one another such as the position of stars and the occurrence of terrestrial events promoted by astrologers. Even more important is that the details of bad explanations can be altered without having to make any alterations in the claims they support. Good explanations, on the other hand, can not be varied without significantly changing their claim. The thesis and sub-thesis of this book are provocative and worthy of consideration.  In the process of analyzing and testing conjectures, humans are prone to making errors and inaccurate judgments. Deutsch does an adequate job of identifying and defining these impediments to accurate knowledge. Some of them, like anthrocentrism and relativism seem right on the mark while others like inductivism and empiricism appear to be somewhat problematical. Empiricism, or the idea that we derive knowledge from our senses, can not be so easily written off. Deutsch explains that our senses deceive us; we can not see that the Earth is round from our vantage point and we can not feel it rotating. Instead, he claims we learn this information indirectly through the use of scientific instruments like telescopes, satellites, computers, and Foucault’s pendulum. It can be accepted that some forms of data are experienced indirectly but this does not disprove empiricism because we depend on our senses to observe and analyze the information gathered by theses instruments; without the sense of sight, any images captured in a telescope would be useless. Telescopes and satellites extend, amplify, and enhance our senses and without empiricism they would be impossible to construct or use. Empiricism is the reason that blind people do not become surgeons. Just because the empiricist philosopher David Hume made some inaccurate statements in his writings does not mean that all of empiricism has to be abandoned. We do not obtain scientific knowledge through inspiration, telepathy, divine revelation, or mystical communion. The information has to be communicated to us somehow and that process takes place because of empirical experience even if that merely means using our sight to read a graph or using our hearing to listen to another scientist explaining mathematics. Deutsch scores some big victories from the start of his book but also makes some horribly problematic claims as well. The book proceeds into the use of these ideas as tools to explain various branches of science like cosmology, space exploration, and evolution. These chapters are interesting, clearly written, and accessible to the lay-person, though a non-scientist may have some trouble judging the soundness of Deutsch’s arguments if they do not have enough background knowledge. One chapter explains the mathematics of infinity in challenging but comprehensible terms that can be grasped by people who are not mathematically inclined. The most imaginative chapter involves Socrates engaging in a dialogue with Hermes during a dream. They discuss the need for epistemology and the conflict between static and dynamic societies, a key concept that permeates the rest of the book. Static societies believe themselves to be perfect, are resistant to change or creativity, and depend on authoritarian rule. A dynamic society strives eternally for an open-ended perfection and so engages in a never ending quest to improve on what is already known. By strictly contrasting the two, Deutsch relies on a false dilemma fallacy and an oversimplification that could easily have been avoided if he had followed his own advice and generated a good explanation for his claim. Besides, it seems most societies combine both stasis and dynamism and even thrive because of the tension between the two. Societies need to have some degree of stasis to remain stable but they also need to be dynamic enough to adapt to inevitable change. Leaning too far in one direction or the other can cause a society to collapse.  This is where The Beginning of Infinity completely falls apart. Deutsch leaves science behind and launches into a chapter about the fallibilty of representative democracy in America. A reader may get a couple pages into this chapter and wonder why it was even included in the book. It appears that Deutsch is trying to demonstrate that Western nations are more progressive because they embrace the idea of improvement and auto-correction. It seems that he is also trying to show that his concept of good explanation and infinite progress have reach outside of science and into other areas of human endeavor. These messages get buried in a dull and muddled mess about the shortcomings of coalition governments and why a representative democracy is mathematically impossible but still superior to other forms of government.  Another confusing chapter is one where Deutsch attempts to demonstrate the existence of objective beauty. Genetically speaking, flowers and bees evolved simultaneously so that their symbiotic relationship would ensure the survival of both species. This is quite interesting but he tries to make a logistical leap and explain that flowers look beautiful because human genes adapted to find them attractive in a similar way. But he does not give a complete answer as to how humans benefited from this adaptation. He also does not take into account that there are vast numbers of people who are indifferent to whether flowers are actually beautiful or not. Some people even hate them. But this leads into a discussion on how humans evolved to find objective beauty in music and art, specifically the orchestral works of Mozart. He points out that musical expression reached a peak in Mozart’s day because he lived in a dynamic society that valued change and innovation and a static society could never have produced such a genius. This is probably true but his concept of objective perfection in aesthetics is entirely Eurocentric which qualifies it as a subject form of beauty rather than an objective one. Besides, in the entire world’s population, the people who actively listen to and enjoy Mozart are a minority. Professional wrestling is more popular internationally than classical music. Even worse, the example of Mozart contradicts his claim that in dynamic societies the process of analysis, modification, and correction lead us along an eternal path of getting closer to truth; it can only be stated as an opinion that classical music has developed into forms that are more complex, superior, and perfect than Mozart. Deutsch never even takes into account that Mozart’s The Magic Flute has never been considered to be much of anything but junk by most his listeners which might make the case that Mozart was the peak of aesthetic realization a little weaker.  If aesthetics have evolved, classical music may or may not have gotten better but what about other forms of art and entertainment that came post-Mozart? We not only have John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix but there is are also aesthetic forms like the bad taste films of John Waters, death metal, industrial music and power electronics, niche and fetish categories of pornography, the Cinema of Transgression, the art of Hermann Nitzsch, the Viennese Actionists, and Paul McCarthy, all of which embrace an aesthetic of ugliness, offensiveness, or disturbing content. Adherents to these forms of aesthetics might willingly admit that Mozart is artistically superior but they probably would not spend much time listening to his music either. So how do these art forms fit in with the optimistic view of human progress held by David Deutsch? Maybe the concepts of progress and evolution need to be separated? In any case, his examples of flowers and Mozart do not sufficiently make the case that objective beauty exists. By far, the worst chapter in the book is the one describing the multiverse theory of quantum mechanics. He starts off with some stuff about transporter technology in the Star Trek tv series, veers off into some other stuff about writing a science fiction novel about a man and woman who fall in love on a spaceship, then mashes all this up with explanations of parallel universes and alternate threads of history. It is a confusing, disjointed mess. Ironically, the most poorly written chapter is also about Deutsch’s pet theory and area of expertise, one he admittedly says is not popular with other theoretical physicists. He says his theory of the multiverse is the most correct and condemns its critics for using instrumentalism and bad explanations to disprove it; other than that he never gives any details as to why they are wrong. He just states that hey are and moves on. He is capable of describing these things too; if you look him up on Youtube you will find his videos where he clearly explains these concepts. Even worse, this chapter seems entirely arbitrary; it does not fit snugly in with the main thesis of the book and does nothing to enhance the other concepts he presents either. The Beginning of Infinity picks up again with a good section on the evolution and replication of genes and memes that is rooted in the work of Richard Dawkins. Deutsch ruins himself, though, as he takes up the idea of static and dynamic societies again. He makes the claim that Native American societies were static and post-Enlightenment white people were dynamic then dives headfirst into Social Darwinist territory by claiming that Native Americans failed because they never taught themselves how to domesticate animals. So their cultural evolution “failed” because they did not arrive at the same endpoint as Europeans? For the most part, the indigenous people of the Americas were not only surviving but thriving on their own terms until the Europeans showed up with their guns and their syphilis and tried to ethnically cleanse them. If left alone, they could very well have developed some form of science or industry, possibly even something entirely different that Europeans could never have conceived of. We will never know because the invaders decimated them.  Deutsch attributes this “failure” to the inability of Native American people to use their imaginations. So the people who crossed the Baring Strait from Russia and migrated throughout the entire continents of North and South America as well as the Caribbean Islands were incapable of imagination? How does that lack of imagination account for the pictographic writing system of the Mayans or the empire built by the Aztecs? How about the Aztec pyramids? How did people with no imagination develop a rich tapestry of mythology, folklore, and shamanic practices? What about the Navajo language that is considered to be one of the most semantically and syntactically complex languages in the world? These are products of people who had no imagination? Archaeology does not support the idea that Native Americans were static and incapable of innovation either. Some societies evolved from using bone tools to carving stone into tools and sometimes combining them with sharp minerals like obsidian. Southwestern pueblo architecture and pottery production showed clear signs of cultural evolution. Some tribes evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherer nomads into sedentary or semi-sedentary agricultural societies. Complex tribal federations created by the Cherokees and Iroquois show an ability to innovate politically as well.  Deutsch claims they were incapable of innovation because they never tried to domesticate the woolly mammoths or mastodons that existed in North America when they arrived and instead killed them off by over-hunting. But think for a minute. If you were a nomad in a band of fifty people or so and you encountered a woolly mammoth, wouldn’t it make sense to kill it? If your immediate need is food it would supply your band with enough to last a while and also provide skins for clothes and bones for tools and weapons. It seems like trying to catch a woolly mammoth, tame it, learn how to ride it and use it for work would not only be precarious and dangerous but also a tremendous waste of time and effort. A giant hairy elephant would not present itself as something easy to control and losing a person or two in the attempt could be devastating to a small society where all members would contribute to the band’s chances of survival. We also do not know what they thought. Maybe they imagined taming the animals but failed in their attempts to do so.  Deutsch goes on to say that static societies are more like animals than dynamic societies. It gets worse when he says this is not a racist theory because static societies are not genetically inferior humans; they are psychologically inferior instead. As if that is not racist; transferring a racist concept from one domain to another does not make the concept not racist. He continues on with the idea that Western societies are psychologically superior because of their achievements in science and we can almost hear alt.right douschebags like Gavin McInnes and Steve Bannon cheering in the background. Deutsch’s entire explanation of Native Americans as a static society is based on cherry picking and hasty conclusions. He does not appear to know much about the history of indigenous people but that is probably because he spent his life in the laboratory and very little time learning ab"
285,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,One of the most interesting and provocative philosophy of science books I have ever read and one that I look forward to re-reading again and again.
286,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249268-jens,0,"After reading the first chapter:First off, it's an well written book. Chapter 1 titled ""The Reach of Explanations"" is excellent at explaining science as essentially the quest for better explanations, and the Enlightenment as the point in time where this kicked off in earnest. It makes a great case for what constitutes a good vs. a bad explanation, etc, etc. In the spirit of the chapter's purpose, I have nothing to complain about.However, the book was recommended to me explicitly as the best refutation of the computational theory of mind, and therefore I of course tried to find something on that topic in every bit I read.With that in mind, I can't help but notice that the first chapter already is full of biases and inconsistencies that curl my toenails.The author doesn't specifically mention anything on the computational theory of mind, but veers off into epistemology. That he condemns empiricism and inductivisim to the scrap heap of history is fair enough. He explains well enough that they were steps up from previous explanations on reasoning which required a priori knowledge of the working of the world, he then goes on to explain reasoning in kind of, but not quite, the abductive model. Except he phrases the entire thing without mentioning the terminology, and in a way that would require a priori knowledge to function, which contradicts his earlier criticism.The simpler explanation would be that abductive reasoning is inductive reasoning based on incompletely understood empirically collected data. To top off my annoyance, that is not the current state of the art in scientific endeavours (caveat: based on the papers I read, which is admittedly not an input set representative of the whole of science). That appears to be Bayesian statistics, which could - for the sake of brevity - be described as a cyclic refinement of abductive reasoning trending towards inductive reasoning, based on ever improving empirically collected data.Or, to put it in a nutshell, all of the ""bad reasoning"" approaches Deutsch decries connected in a way that would allow abolishing the ""good reasoning"" approach he seems to like.Interestingly, that doesn't change that the chapter is actually good. It just seems that someone bowed out of the entire train of thought just before the end because it got complicated. I somewhat doubt that's Deutsch himself, so it must have been the intended readership. Deutsch or his editor(s) seem to think scientific reasoning is too complex to explain fully, so they hacked away at the explanations to make them much simpler, leaving a solid enough story at a shallow read, but a jumbled mess at a deeper read.(See what I did above, by the way? I gave the shallow read/easy explanation after the deep read/complex explanation as a TL;DR summary. I'm not saying that's the only way to solve this dilemma, nor that it's the best, but it's one way of keeping more readers on board.)So with that written, I have the expectation set that the remainder of the book will be good with fairly painful moments. We'll see how it goes. When I'm done reading, I hope I'll update this review.After Chapter 3Chapter 2 was fine. I have nothing to complain about (yes, I'm complaining, I realize that). So I will turn to Chapter 3.The topic of Chapter 3 is how human activity is a ""spark"" for turning an otherwise knowledge-free universe into one generating knowledge. It reads as if it is intended to encourage scientific endeavour, and I suppose it does. I approve of this goal, even.And yet, individual passages drive me nuts because of their logical fallacies. It seems as if Deutsch arrives at the best possible conclusion precisely because he misunderstands some things and misconstrues others. If all I cared about were effects, I wouldn't mind, but I also care about causes.So, let's go through my main annoyances.Deutsch uses the Principle of Mediocrity (""there's nothing special about humans on the cosmic scale"") and the Spaceship Earth Metaphor (""earth is a uniquely suitable biosphere travelling through hostile space"") to explain that they are both not in fact enlightened points of view, but rather backwards. I understand the second somewhat, and for space reasons I'm going to skip it.But his explanation for challenging the Principle of Mediocrity is so contrived, it is painful. The Principle states more fully that because there are countless planets like ours orbiting suns like ours, which therefore have the same conditions as ours, it's likely that there'll be creatures like ourselves, which makes us anything but not special. His counter argument is that on the contrary, we are special, because for all the countless places in the universe with exactly earth-like conditions, there are orders of magnitude more places which have very different conditions.He's right, of course, that precisely because earth-like conditions are rare, they are special. But he's wrong in assuming that must mean that the Principle of Mediocrity is wrong. Because what it says encodes a different point of view than mere statistics; it states that small enough differences are negligible.Because, let's face it, there are no conditions exactly earth-like in the universe unless there's some kind of mirroring. Other earth-like planets orbiting earth-like suns will not have the exact same other count, or size of planetary objects in the solar system. Yet these differences do not matter, because they leave conditions sufficiently earth-like.So if these small differences do not matter, what about almost-earth-like conditions? What about conditions where everything is earth-like, but there are two smaller moons? They will influence tides differently, and may create conditions in which earth-like life cannot arise. What about almost-almost-earth-like conditions?If you examine the universe by similarity, you can reach to its ends (hypothetically speaking) and for every part of space find a part that's comparable enough. So the question is: what makes earth-like more special than almost-earth-like or any of the other closely related conditions? Nothing, except us. We live only in earth-like conditions.Which means Deutsch is essentially espousing the kind of anthropomorphic point of view he accuses the Principle of Mediocrity to espouse, and... hilarity ensues! But apparently that's not something he sees, or wishes to see.There are a number of similar anthropomorphism he commits to, and similar gaps in his argumentation. But the culmination of it is the conclusion of his chapter, stating that people matter in the cosmic scheme of things because they generate knowledge.His chain of argumentation isn't wrong. It's just a particular point of view, that values the abstract concept of knowledge more highly than the brains in which the knowledge is encoded. What the entire chapter is stating, really, is that he wants meaning to be meaningful precisely because humans create meaning out of the information the universe contains.The argument he provides is that humans purposely affecting their environment changes how other intelligent beings would perceive our environment. Their scientific models might predict the atmosphere to contain less pollutants, but they perceive more, so they must adjust their models to that fact - and only including human activity will provide a good model.So that's fine, in itself. What's puzzling - other than explaining it by wishful thinking - is where he draws the difference between purposeful human activity and other natural processes.Viewed from a distance, an inflammation is reddened and swollen flesh and skin, possibly producing pus. Viewed more closely, all of these are symptoms of underlying mechanisms, all of which purposefully fight an infection. The swelling constricts blood vessels, somewhat isolating the infected area from others. The pus are dead white blood cells bound to whatever they're fighting off.Similarly viewed from a distance, pollutants in the atmosphere are just there. When you look more closely, you might find either a lot of volcanic activity, or human activity causing it. Of course when examining the causes it's important to make this separation, but if the effect is the same, why other than arbitrary choice is one cause more important than another? Put differently, what makes purposeful human activity more important than any other physical or chemical process in the universe?Only the meaning we attribute to it. So people are meaningful because we want them to be meaningful, and here the cat bites its own tail. Deutsch falls for the anthropomorphism fallacy so hard, he doesn't even see it in himself, only in others.It's sad to read.And yet, his message that we should rejoice in how we can affect the universe, and should accumulate knowledge in order to ever improve our conditions, well... I can't argue with that. I just attribute it to fulfilling my biological imperative, i.e. chemical rewards, i.e. fun - and egotism, which is the mental construct for the same.Anyway. After this, I expect to be back for more at a later chapter."
287,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"I am a huge fan of David Deutsch based on his TED talks but I did not like this book.1. Deutsch is against inductivism. 2. He believes that we first ""conjecture"" an understanding of how things work and only afterwards do we observe to see if this is true. (Many philosophers have recognized that our ability to think of mathematics is special, and can be developed a priori before we make observations to confirm if the math is correct. Deutsch seems to be expanding this to apply to all models of understanding, which he loosely calls conjecture.)3. Deutsch believes that our ability to conjecture is ""creativity"" and is only possible because we have an abstract language and number system which can express infinite insights. 4. The “infinite” journey only began during the European Enlightenment which added the key elements of a culture of open publication and freedom of thought, which allows for criticism. 5. This Enlightenment culture ensures that bad conjectures are constantly being superseded by better conjectures. This will continue forever. Human beings have embarked on an infinite increase in our understanding. I found it strange that Deutsch criticizes inductivism but does not give a fair description of the problem that Hume and the entire history of epistemology was trying to solve, i.e. skepticism. Also, Deutsch’s philosophy feels like a particularly hollow one, devoid of morality, spirituality, and self knowledge. In the end, he seems to be urging blind faith in scientific theorists, and blind faith that scientific progress is good. It is easy to ask questions which challenge this viewpoint. Here's one: Why is our progress in agricultural productivity considered good? We could have had fewer people, got on just fine, and we would not be destroying habitats and fomenting mass extinctions. Here's another: If we keep making progress won't we have another World War? By making ourselves extinct, we would fall well short of ""infinity."" Here’s a third: How can progress be infinite if China, Russia, and other authoritarian regimes are ascendant, and since it is so easy for them to undermine our enlightenment culture by appealing to our greed?"
288,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72212377-sergio-alonso-de-leon,5,"Mindblowing. A collection of wisdom and brilliant ideas. I cannot recomment more. The Book is long and dense, but relatively understandable (although I found myself going back often to fully grast the ideas) thanks to a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. The basic thread of the book if that once you trigger knowledge, it leads to stages impossible to imagine. Future is impossible to predict, yet infititely open for wonderful things. Human ingenuity has triggered the beginning of infinity. Among the beautiful extracts, I have underlined:As the ancient philosopher Heraclitus remarked, ‘No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.’Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity – that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe happen far above or below those scales. That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than later.I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic.Here is another misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without creative thought. Its other name is death.Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second. Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We shall always be at the beginning of infinity.From the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not ‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further progress. The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works. Once that has been solved, programming it will not be difficult. Even artificial evolution may not have been achieved yet, despite appearances. There the problem is that we do not understand the nature of the universality of the DNA replication system.If the population of less-educated, religiously conservative individuals increases and continues to vote as they have been voting, funding for education and scientific research is also likely to decrease. A less-educated population could contribute not only to an upward shift in population size but also to a downward economic spiral, for reasons linked to some fascinating findings by Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. These researchers examined the economic consequences of variations in IQ across ninety countries, analyzing the average IQ of each country’s population as a whole, as well as the average IQ of the “intellectual elite”Virtually all of them could have avoided the catastrophes that destroyed them if only they had possessed a little additional knowledge, such as improved agricultural or military technology, better hygiene, or better political or economic institutions. Very few, if any, could have been saved by greater caution about innovation. In fact most had enthusiastically implemented the precautionary principle.‘power of population’ and the ‘power of production’. But that was just a parochial mistake – the same one that Michelson and Lagrange made. They all thought they were making sober predictions based on the best knowledge available to them. In reality they were all allowing themselves to be misled by the ineluctable fact of the human condition that we do not yet know what we have not yet discovered. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed.All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.It is absurdly parochial to read some deep significance into this particular failure, among so many, of the biosphere to support human life – or of medical science throughout the ages to cure ageing. The problem of ageing is of the same general type as that of disease. Although it is a complex problem by present-day standards, the complexity is finite and confined to a relatively narrow arena whose basic principles are already fairly well understood. Meanwhile, knowledge in the relevant fields is increasing exponentially.Popper put it, a duty to be optimistic – in general, and about civilization in particular.a consensus had emerged among most major political movements that the future welfare of humankind would depend on an increase in society-wide (preferably worldwide) planning and decision-making.when society as a whole faces a choice, and citizens differ in their preferences among the options, which option is it best for society to choose?Popper’s criterion Good political institutions are those that make it as easy as possible to detect whether a ruler or policy is a mistake, and to remove rulers or policies without violence when they are.It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed.But, while a society lasted, all important areas of life seemed changeless to the participants: they could expect to die under much the same moral values, personal lifestyles, conceptual framework, technology and pattern of economic production as they were born under. And, of the changes that did occur, few were for the better. I shall call such societies ‘static societies’: societies Western society would become the beginning of infinity or be destroyed.Only the Enlightenment, hundreds of thousands of years later, and after who knows how many false starts, may at last have made it practical to escape from that eternity into infinity.The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the beginning of infinity.So, what would it have taken for some of those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and physical risk.Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels and Diamond. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders, superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much…It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal. "
289,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/898786-kyle,4,"A magnum opus for the philosophy of science, and probably one of the most powerful and incisive statements of (and arguments for) a rational, critical theory for human life. David Deutsch, a physicist at Oxford, makes a profound case in science, history, and the world at large for good explanations and knowledge-creation. He argues, against the grain of nearly every wishy-washy and/or unproductive explanation out there, that human beings and their ideas are the sum-total origin of progress in the universe.In the course of his work, Deutsch reinforces a system of objective, fluid, beautiful awareness. He nicely parries counterarguments that his propositions are conceited or anthropocentric or purposeless/misguided. He refutes specific ideas and overarching philosophies (empiricism and positivism, holism and induction and behaviorism, postmodernism and most modernism, et al.) that limit by insidious design what we can learn. Society must be dynamic and individuals creative to make a proper memetic vein through which a good and fecund idea can flow.For instance, particle/wave indecision in quantum theory has led many simpletons to rush into quackery, but Deutsch lucidly analyzes the physics and dials back its more hysterical misunderstanders. Postmodernism can only arbitrarily (in a lightning-quick circulus in probando) propose that everything's arbitrary. And there are reductionist, lazy, dehumanizing 'interpretation-heavy' explanations all the rage in modern science: eg., Jared Diamond's reductionist fallacies, behaviorism's dehumanizing explanation-jumping, etc. In a clear distillation of what pseudoscience is, Deutsch writes that the bad can't always be countered by the good because the bad holds itself immune.I think Deutsch slips only occasionally, as when he tries to stretch his ideas into aesthetics (beauty has a strange synthesis of both parochial and objectively universal traits, both applied and pure?) or when, during his examination of memetics, he twice mentions offhand some pretty small but pretty egregious points (isn't humanity having more of a place in evolution [analogizing earth's evolutionary lifespan to a day gives humanity a second/a minute/a few hours?] pretty anthropocentric really? & aren't copycat suicides too literal, and therefore crass, of an example for meme-replication?), both of which could do with some more argument.The conclusion he makes, ""nearly there"" optimism is actually a pessimistic utopianism (there would be some magical ultimate structure, after which lay an inexplicable void: a tiny frozen island), comes rightly enough in an ultimate chapter called ""The Beginning."" Science, or indeed any knowledge, claims neither infallibility nor finality; we can only go from problems to better problems, never from problems to solutions."
290,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Goodreads reviewer Andy said this, and I couldn't have said it as well:I am not sure that another book has influenced my thinking quite as much as The Beginning of Infinity.As I read through Deutsch's many provocative assertions, I often reacted with instinctive scorn and disbelief. But with only a few exceptions, I found myself within a few pages not only persuaded but convinced of the utter obviousness of his ideas.The specific assertions in this book are important not because of the claims they make relevant to that field, but because they are meta-assertions which empower every field, even when we have no idea what's coming.Blair writes another excellent review, summing the book up in considerable detail.To be completely derivative, here is David Deutsch himself in an excerpt from his introduction to the book:Progress that is both rapid enough to be noticed and stable enough to continue over many generations has been achieved only once in the history of our species. It began at approximately the time of the scientific revolution, and is still under way. It has included improvements not only in scientific understanding, but also in technology, political institutions, moral values, art, and every aspect of human welfare.Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation – and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense.In this book I argue that all progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things.Deutsch does rabbit on at times, and most of his cosmology and quantum physics was impenetrable to me, but it was worth it. I love his brave iconoclasm, and brilliance has its privileges. His positivity makes sense, and that's how I want to live."
291,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10605496-daniel,1,"I hated this book.It starts off well enough. His primary theme that explanations drive science and progress is compelling. His case for optimism in regards to the future also make sense. And I was enthused by the first chapter, which encapsulates the best parts of the book: he thinks deeply about the underlying philosophy of science in a way almost no books about science do, and he makes a stand, saying why everyone else is wrong but him. Taking that sort of stand with no hedging is refreshing.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is composed of only loosely organized discursions, and his rejections of everyone else (tl;dr - every philosopher except for Karl Popper is wrong. Most scientists are wrong also, even about their own work) after a while come across as not bold, but tedious, even obtuse, as his justifications are unconvincing.Two arguments seem particularly objectionable. One, his wholesale rejection of the standards of epistemology is stunning, because in the end, he essentially dismisses it by fiat. He says arguing over justified belief is pointless, and while he doesn’t explicitly say so, he basically forwards a theory of pragmatism - some things (namely explanations) are true because their useful. Since science has given us progressively more useful theories, there is an objective truth. In my opinion, that’s pretty weak and kind of misses the point.His chapter on beauty is also nuts. He argues (again, mostly by fiat) that there is such a thing as objective beauty. That’s fine, but he then says history will progress towards that objective beauty - indeed, progresses towards it even now - much as science progresses towards objective truth. That’s crazy talk and inconsistent by his own example for music, where he talks about Beethoven. By his standard, we should be talking about recent musical progress as being closer to objective beauty than something so old, maybe Grandmaster Flash, not Beethoven.There are other bits that are interesting, like the chapter on multiverses, which is the clearest explanation of that I’ve read. But even that chapter, as with most, I’m not sure how it relates to the point. It’s entirely possible that it went over my head. But the book is about the primary of explanations, and if it didn’t explain things well, that seems hugely flawed."
292,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Positively, this book tries to explain the world with what we know today rather than based on expanding on the celebrated theories supported by great thinkers of other era. As a result, it is modern, novel and rational for readers with latest knowledge. The book contains many interesting scientific and mathematical explanations. Some of the messages are strong and driven home effectively. The criticism’s of some of the past theories are also strong with desired results. That said, the book contains enormous flaws as one starts thinking more. The author falls in the same trap of falling for his own pet explanations as the right ones that it criticizes others for. For example, the multiverse epistemology behind quantum mechanics appears nothing but a leap of faith that the author strongly abhors in – let’s say – all explanation theories involving God. Even if in the long run, this theory is provable, the fact that it is not today (except in mild form in some equations) should not have been a reason enough to discard other explanations.There are many other criticisms one can draw when author summarily reject many theories in favour of his own views. But the biggest problem in the book is when author begins to stray away from explaining theories of existence to theories of how one should live. With the pre-decided conclusion that one must stay optimistic, the author turns more anthropomorphic and irrational without logic than most theories out there. The author begins to miss the basic point: the world does not have to have humans surviving, if his own non-anthropomorphic bias for the world view is right. In this case, why should one waste nearly a third of the book in random ramblings trying to justify the reason why pessimistic Malthusian-type theories must be wrong. The author also turns too dogmatic in his own views and conclusions to provide any rational basis for rejecting these theories except anecdotal evidences of how such theories have so far not proven right.In all, a book where one learns a lot about how to think but the book falls repeatedly flat while drawing its own conclusions. The conclusions may or may not be right but not the rigor of arguments presented here, which would jar most serious readers."
293,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"David Hilbert, the great and influential German mathematician, made a famous pronouncement in 1930: We Must know. We shall know. (In a bit of cruel irony, Gödel first announced his Incompleteness Theorem a day before Hilbert made this statement.) These words are inscribed on his tombstone. That was before progress and objective truth and other Enlightenment ideas went out of fashion in the twentieth century. Enlightenment is back with a vengeance, reincarnated as David Deutsch. Call it Extreme Enlightenment. It’s not just knowledge and progress. It’s infinite knowledge and progress. Deutsch says that once an intelligent agent, like our species, starts producing explanatory science, there’s literally no limit to how far knowledge and progress can go. The only limitations are the laws of nature. All those pessimists who think that, just as a dog is inherently incapable of understanding quantum physics, there may be levels of truth inaccessible to human mind – they should think again. The reach of explanatory knowledge is infinite. We must know. We shall know. And there is nothing that we cannot know, goddammit.Infinite progress is all fine and dandy. What is not is this book. Deutsch is obviously an exceedingly sharp and well-read physicist. I’m very happy to see a theoretical physicist who has read Popper forward and backward and can take on Wittgenstein. The book as a whole, however, comes off as long-winded and rambling. It has quite a few interesting ideas to present, but it lacks cohesion, in spite of Deutsch’s effort to reinforce a common theme (infinite progress) and keep reminding us of it in each chapter. I found his presentation of the Many Universes interpretation of quantum physics very odd, to say the least. The chapters on culture and aesthetics and social theory can be challenged on different levels. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Really nice and worthy try, Professor Deutsch, but if you write such a long and dense book, better make it worthy of our time. "
294,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"This book is a fair mixture of science and philosophy, channeling some ideas of Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Hugh Everett and other thinkers and scientists in a very original discursive but consistent manner. If you need some science-grounded optimism in your life, pick it up. It won't disappoint. The key argument David Deutsch makes is that we need good explanations of reality. We need bad philosophy (the one which offers bad explanations) to fail if we want progress. The author thinks we are on the right track. ""The ideas with the best chance of surviving through many generations of change are truths with reach – deep truths. People are fallible; they often have preferences for false, shallow, useless or morally wrong ideas. But which false ideas they prefer differs from one person to another, and changes with time. Under changed circumstances, a specious falsehood or parochial truth can survive only by luck. But a true, deep idea has an objective reason to be considered useful by people with diverse purposes over long periods. For instance, Newton’s laws are useful for building better cathedrals, but also for building better bridges and designing better artillery. Because of this reach, they get themselves remembered and enacted by all sorts of people, many of them vehemently opposed to each other’s objectives, over many generations. This is the kind of idea that has a chance of becoming a long-lived meme in a rapidly changing society,"" Deutsch offers.I think it's a fair assumption. It adds some notes to the choir of moral philosophers and thinkers, like Parfit and Singer, searching justifications for objective morality. Deutsch is not a philosopher, but this book may be interesting for aspiring philosophers and ethicists, not just astrophysics buffs. And that is something what I really enjoy about this book. Deutsch goes far beyond his field of expertise without losing credibility."
295,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29371480-karl-galle,3,"This book is a little like watching a clever person talk to himself inside a mostly empty room. There are moments that are insightful and rewarding, but you suspect that if you and half a dozen of your friends or colleagues got up and went somewhere else, he would probably still be sitting there talking an hour later without having noticed that anyone left (or possibly that anyone was even there to begin with). I would be the absolute last person to criticize anyone for wanting to think creatively about disciplines outside their own specialty, but there is a certain point at which entire fields like art, political science, and the history of philosophy cannot be derived from first principles by a quantum physicist unless he or she wants to seriously engage with a bit more of the existing literature in those disciplines and try to understand it before starting over from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen here. The end result is a meandering and often frustrating argument that does lay out the author's main points clearly –- and to be fair, will probably have at least a few intriguing and even optimism-inducing points for most readers –- but also still regrettably feels occasionally more like a long-winded dinner guest rather than an entertaining conversation inside the scientific community. If you like philosophical speculation on the nature and possibility of increasing knowledge about the physical universe, you might enjoy this book, but there are other books that give a much broader overview of actual research that is taking place today in the physical sciences."
296,0670022756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179716-don,1,"Could not finish... I had a sub-channel of judgment going all the time about this man's self-congratulatory tone and promises to make things more justifyingly interesting in some future chapter. I guess I just didn't find him as elucidating as he continually promises to be.One of his premises that I did find useful was the idea that real progress in the advancement of knowledge is barely discernable, if at all, within the limited time frame of the observer. It is only in the long view of historical hindsight that the increment of genuine advancement can be noticed. But, as the title suggests, we are continually at the beginning of this notion of purposeful knowledge. And really, with the promise of infinity stretching out before us, we are at a virtual standstill. Infinity, by definition, has neither an end nor a beginning. This book likewise seems to start at some arbitrary point in space and expands to fill a void of understanding with so few tangible facts, the end result feels as empty as the darkness and vacuum of his self-defining cube of an interstellar average. Exceedingly empty or at best filled only with gas.One entertaining aspect was that the reader sounded a lot like Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. It helped with the delivery of the dry and theoretical monotony to imagine it was Data mimicking an exceedingly long attempt at a human joke. Unfortunately, it was taking an infinity to reach the punchline and I simply didn't have time to wait. "

The book tends to be a secular common sense raised to the status of an academic lecture. But it does describe nicely the evolution of scientific thought and has good summaries after each chapter.I mostly object to the chapter on the objectivity of beauty. Except for that I subscribe to the arguments presented. It is a good check-up for a healthy employment of logic for the purpose of the evolution of knowledge, ie scientific knowledge.There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us is in any case: infinity. All we can choose is whether is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge, wrong or right, death or life. (David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, last paragraph of the book)The nature of science would be better understood if we called theories ""misconceptions"" from the outset instead of only after we discovered their successors. Thus we could say that Einstein’s conception of gravity was an improvement on Newton’s misconception which was an improvement on Kepler’s. The neodarwinian misconception of evolution is an improvement on Darwin’s misconception and his on Lamarck’s.(David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 18)"

Parts of it read a little like science fiction but the author assures us it all based on good science. The first half of this book was the hardest to read, and was dense with scientific updates, theories and physics, most of which I had some acquaintance with but certainly no in depth working knowledge so it was slow going. Nevertheless if you hang in there (and I realize certainly many of you may be much more sophisticated than I in the physics /science dept ) the second half, as we come to it prepared by the work of the first half, is much more ""user"" friendly and was relatable to things that I actually have thought about as well. It gives you, at the end, a feeling of limitless progress to be made by we humans, and is optimistic that we have unlimited future to solve problems, meet more and progress to places not yet thought of .... so go to it world, and live up to our evolutionary problem solving natures. Well worth the read. Something that you might have read more than once to gain all that lies within."

Increasingly compelling - this is one of those books during which you end up telling people about after you've read each chapter. It's difficult to think about the progression of humanity in the same way after reading this and there are so many 'What!?' moments.The chapter on Infinity itself is not easy to grasp. But I guess infinity as a concept is a pretty hard thing to come to terms with. This chapter, along with 'Multiverse', really made the old cogs in my brain scrape and scratch. I'm certainly no physicist and if you're like me - much more used to reading novels, plays etc - I'd advise you not to try to go down the path of wanting to fully understand every single thing mentioned. The overall picture, even when reading in this discriminatory manner, won't be lost on the curious reader.Overall, I enjoyed the positive, enthusiastic and up-beat attitude in this book. Humanity - so long as it does not retreat into the form of a static society, and looks towards creativity - has the potential to continue for infinity. I like that thought."
