The perilous existence of the big animals, namely lions (in India), crocodiles (in Australia), bears (Romania) and tigers (in Russia) are discussed. He talks about our love affair with the lion, ""Richard I of England was renowned as lionhearted, after all, not bearish."" Lions in India are found wild in the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park in the mid-western part of the country. 325 lions reside side by side with the Maldhari herders. ""The largest predators are spread thinly on Earth, because energy, in forms they can harvest, is limited and broadly dispersed."" That is why, ""Big, fierce animals are inherently rare."" on the earth and getting rarer because where they are wild they must compete with humans for space and food.He predicts in the book that all large animals will be completely gone by 2050 unless something is done which is a horrific, shocking prediction and I hope is not true."

This book explains the place these animals have in our culture in mithhs, fear, reverence and even godliness. The author did extensive research both physically and scollarly to create this fabulas volume. Enjoy and Be Blessed."
2,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795467-spencer,5,"This book has a misleading title. It is about neither monsters (in the traditional sense of the word) nor God. Instead, it is about what the author calls ""alpha"" predators - animals that are large enough and strong enough to kill humans, and which have been known at times to feed on them afterwards. Although this topic sounds a bit disturbing and gruesome, this book is not a cheap catalog of gory animal attacks. Instead, it is a fascinating look at four specific alpha predators, their history and current status, with a particular focus on how they have interacted (peaceably and at times violently) with humans over time. The author spends time exploring the lives, habitat and neighboring human communities associated with a population of lions in western India, the saltwater crocodiles of central northern Australia, bears inhabiting the mountains of Romania, and the siberian tigers of far eastern Russia. Throughout the book he discusses history, geography, conservationism, philosophy, politics, religion, ecology, biographies (of important scientists and politicians), anthropology, dentistry (of animals!), and many other topics. I really enjoyed this book, both for the breadth of topics covered, but also for the author's beautiful writing style. I really felt like he took me around the world with him as he explored these topics. I highly recommend this book!"
3,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Quammen takes the reader on a tour, both geographical and historical, of the world of the Alpha Predators. The Asian Lion (Panthera leo persica) survives in the Gir Forest of the Kathiabar Peninsula, an outcropping of western India. The Salt Water Crocodile (Crocodylus porosis) is found in the mangrove wetlands of the Baitarani River delta in eastern India. The Freshwater Crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni) is found in northern Australia's Arnhem Land. The Brown Bear (Ursus arctos) lives in the hardwood forests of the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. The Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) resides in the Bikin River Valley of Russia's far east. The book is much more than a mere travelogue, however. Hefty doses of history, mythology, and psychological speculation are offered as well. The connection is important; not just a diversion. “Throughout our history as a species — tens of millennia, hundreds of millennia, going on two million years — we have tolerated the dangerous, problematic presence of big predators, finding roles for them within our emotional universe. But now our own numerousness, our puissance, and our solipsism have brought us to a point where tolerance is unnecessary and danger of that sort is unacceptable.” (p.14-15) One of Quammen's gifts is his ability to pivot seamlessly between the intimacy of storytelling and the calculus of ecology. He recounts the warmth and hospitality of Romanian shepherds, Yolngu tribesmen in Arnhem Land, Udege hunters, and Maldhari herders. All of them live among these alpha predators. Their overall stoicism and sanguine fatalism covers a wide range of attitudes, from admiration, to tolerance, to dislike. They share a special intimacy with these alpha predators. These are the people whom Quammen relies on to guide him, educate him, shelter him and protect him. He notes that it is not merely proximity that puts these people in peril. Among the Maldhari, those unable to afford shelters for their livestock suffer the greatest losses. In other words, the poorest are the most vulnerable. Quammen calls this the Muscrat Conundrum, after the biologist Paul Errington, who studied the effects of mink predation on muskrat populations. The limiting factor on muskrat population is not the mink population, but the muskrats' own territorial dynamic. Muskrats are sensitive to crowding. When the limit is reached a marginal population is created. The marginal population lives in less protected areas, and is less well-nourished. These are the muskrats available as prey to the mink. Applying Errington's findings, Quammen asks: “Is it inevitable that the costs exacted by alpha predators be borne disproportionately by poor people — in particular, by tradition-bound rural groups such as the Maldharis of Gir, the Udege of southeastern Russia, the shepherds of highland Romania, all nearly powerless and voiceless within larger national contexts — when the spiritual and aesthetic benefits of those magnificent beasts are enjoyed from afar?....[I]t's a matter we cozier muskrats need to address. (p.124)Another though-provoking idea that Quammen examines is the claim by Grahame Webb that conservation of alpha predators can only be accomplished by promoting teir economic viability. His example is the salt water crocodile. By allowing a certain quantity to be killed for their valuable leather, conservationists can motivate government protection. The same model is espoused by a Romanian gamekeeper, Arpad Sarkany, who argues for selling expensive hunting licenses to wealthy westerners. It's a controversial idea on both emotional and practical grounds. Some of these animal populations are so small that biologists even give names to individuals they have managed to track with radio collars. More disturbing to me, is the implicit acknowledgment that we have permanently created a society where only money is valued. Quammen ends on a sobering note. The idea of a “stagnant economy” sends shivers up the national spine. The society we have created relies on growth, not stability. The world's population will continue to increase. More people means less space for animal habitat. The math is simple and devastating. Buried within these weighty issues are some entertaining stories ranging from lurid to awe-inspiring. Quammen recounts the miraculous escape of Val Plumwood from a crocodile attach. He also tells the incredible story of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the dictator more famously known as a butcher of the Romanian people. Finally, he describes the beauty of the paintings in Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994. http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/cha....This is a sprawling book with some big ideas, and a wide range of material. Not all of the information will be of interest to all readers. However, the persistent reader will be well-rewarded."
4,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,4,"I really enjoyed this exceptional book on the mythology, culture, history, and biology of man-eaters around the world. Though he primarily focuses on four specific animals - the Asiatic lion in the forest of Gir in India, the saltwater crocodile in northern Australia, the brown bear in the forests and mountains of Romania, and the Siberian (or more properly Amur) tiger of the Russian Far East- author David Quammen discusses other predators as well, such as the African lion, the grizzly of North America, the Nile crocodile, and the leopard as well as some now extinct species.Quammen does an excellent job of covering just about any aspect you might wish to learn about animals that occasionally dine on man. Aspects of ecology are very well covered, introducing the reader to many key concepts in ecology (particularly as they relate to these creatures), such as the terms alpha predator, keystone species, and trophic cascades, showing that for a healty ecosystem - including healthy plants and prey animals - the presence of a viable population of predator is crucial. The education this book gave me on ecology was quite remarkable, with the author going into very readable detail on many issues and very interestingly their history as well, showing some of the personalities behind their conception. The individual biology and paleontology of each of the focus species in this book are well covered, as well as that of close and more distant relations, covering everything from the rise and fall of sabertooth mammals (feline and otherwise) to the spread of the tiger species throughout Asia (and its later evolution into various subspecies).Equally interesting - and valuable - in this work Quammen goes into great detail about the interaction between humans and the top predators throughout world history as well as the situation to date. How have large predators - such as perhaps cave bears and cave lions - shaped the evolution (physically and culturally) of ancient peoples? How have such animals shaped the development of human art, literature, mythology, and religion? Quammen brings into this rather engrossing discussion everything from Babylonian epics to Beowulf to Tolkien.Quammen does not only focus on the animals, but on their sometime victims as well. He looks at how have native peoples dealt with man-eaters in the past and how do traditional peoples deal with them today. Quammen is very sensitive to the lives of those who face (and occassionally feed) these predators, really bringing to life for the reader such diverse groups as the Malhadris of India, the Udege of Russia, and the shepherds of Romania. Quammen vividly contrasts this with looking at how has the coming of colonial enterprises and regimes (such as the British in India and Australia) changed interactions with local alpha predators.Perhaps most importantly, this book asks what does the future hold for such predators? Will they always have a guaranteed place in the wild, outside of zoos and circuses? How can one make sure that they do? There is quite a debate raging on how to make sure that tigers still stalk the snowy forests of the Russian Far East and the billabongs of steamy northern Australia and Quammen provides excellent coverage of all sides.A very valuable and entertaining book, it has a very extensive bibilography as well. I highly recommend it."
5,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,3,"Firstly I would like to point out that I picked up this book thinking that it would be about those alpha predators that have captured and continue to capture the imagination of people around the world. And while Quammen did cover these animals well he was more focused on their place in human history and not our place in theirs, which I did find a little disappointing (but this was a fault of my expectations not the fault of the author). Having said that Quammen does delve into the importance of the alpha predators of the world from their evolution and natural history to their place in the world's ecosystems and their role in maintaining the health and sustainability of such ecosystems. A large part of Quammen's writing does revolve around how these predators have entered into the folklore and mythology of mankind from the earliest myths and legends passed down from generation to generation to their role in the modern world and the various efforts being made to protect these beautiful animals, including their economic value as a sustainable resource (a rather devisive issue to say the least). Overall this is a well written and very well researched book that discusses the many aspects of the world's alpha predators but for me the emphasis was on their influence and value to us a little too much rather than on the animals themselves, but that is personal preference and nothing more."
6,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5831560-samantha-koller,5,"I really enjoyed this book. I think it's a fabulous, approachable book to pick up when you get home from the zoo or natural history museum and want to learn more, without already having a very strong background in ecology. I especially appreciated how Quammen discussed the topic of conservation of dangerous species without being sentimental or minimizing the toll that they take on local populations. The argument for conservation was much more well-rounded and balanced than any I'd been exposed to before. I found the section on crocodiles in Australia especially interesting and thought-provoking. Those are some scary, deadly animals! He always maintained reverence, respect, and awe for the animals, but he was very careful to keep their preservation rooted in context.Reading the other criticism of it, I guess I can understand why some people wouldn't be wowed the same way I was, especially if you're very well-versed in the subject matter. I'll admit the stories are a bit disjointed, and the theory behind the book (the four alpha predator stories) seemed more of an interesting way to tell a story than the structure for a thesis or argument. However, the diverse subject matter continued to be interesting and left me wanting to read more."
7,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26574604-daniel-hecht,5,"I have read all of Quammen's books and consider this one of his best. As always, he writes accessible to the merely curious reader, the amateur naturalist, and the seeker after the larger arcs of life (I am all three). In this case, he deals with the important issue of how human beings do, can, might, or don't tolerate the proximity of creatures that are beautiful, majestic, rare, crucial to ecosystems -- but which might kill and eat us on our way to work. As human populations encroach upon animal habitats throughout the world, the question becomes more urgent every day. David Quammen's voice is knowledgeable, accessible, always entertaining, personal and personable, and brings the animals and the social and philosophical problems they create right to the reader. I loved this book and look forward to reading it again. (Sy Montgomery's Spell of the Tiger addresses some of the same issues.) "
8,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15696054-delene-beeland,5,"What is it about large predators that fascinate us so? Whether it’s sheer admiration for their pluck, strategy or dominance — or abhorrence and hatred at their perceived harm — predators evoke deep emotional responses from most people. And we humans have deeply impacted them too, we’ve changed the course of their evolutionary trajectory. Whether by over-hunting, habitat destruction or decimating their prey base, humans have whittled down the meta-populations of large predators on every continent over the course of the past few hundred years. Many apex predators are now imperiled.David Quammen’s book, Monster of God: The man-eating predator in the jungles of history and the mind, has been out since 2003, but I just got around to reading it this month. Quammen’s premise explores the relationships between native predators and native peoples. He takes the reader on a journey to physical places — the Kathiawar Peninsula and the Brahmani-Baitarani Delta of India, the Carpathian Mountains of Romania, the Arnhem Land Reservation and Maningrida in Australia — as well as literary destinations like the Gilgamesh and Beuwolf. Reading this 437-page tome, you cut across continents and through geologic time.What really makes this book tick is the blend of narrative writing fused with Quammen’s distillation of primary research. He introduces key concepts early, like the “muskrat conundrum” and then fleshes out the abstract ecological concept with real examples. (In this case, examples of niche partitioning and conspecific competition for territory and food resources.) But he doesn’t overdo the science… rather, it reads like a first-person travelogue with pit-stops into the scientific literature. Full, in-depth book review on my blog, here."
9,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,4,"Gods and monstersQuammen touches on the biology, ecology, and culture of large predator species and their interaction with humans--an interaction which can (but doesn't always or exclusively) consist of seeing us as meat on the buffet. He goes to different locations where predator habitats are squeezed, their populations under pressure from hunting, and they are in close contact with humans. It is the variants of these three coordinates, finds Quammen, that leads to bad interactions,Quammen goes easy on the science so that popular audiences can enjoy this account, and read it almost like a travelogue of most unlikely tourist spots (although burgeoning eco-tourism is one factor in ratcheting up those three pressures on the predator population). Spending nights spotlighting 17-foot crocodiles on a remote northern Australia river, or tracking tigers in sub-zero weather in Far Eastern Russia may not be my idea of a fun vacation, but it makes for fascinating reading in Quammen's book. Quammen references not just science and travel, but also philosophy and religion, as he considers the role of the tension between man and large beast throughout history and in religious traditions (for example Leviathan mentioned by Job in the Hebrew scriptures), and concludes with a cautionary point about the role of these kings of the food chain in maintaining equilibrium among and between species. Interesting reading, although apparently readers didn't think so when it was new. I bought this book, one of several pristine copies available, at an ""Everything's $1"" store! It deserved a better fate than this."
10,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"A fairly well-written book that's heavy on anecdote and sadly light on analysis or novel commentary. Quammen spends a long, long time talking about his model organisms (Asiatic lions in India, saltwater crocs in Australia, brown bears in Romania, and Amur tigers in the Russian Far East). These passages contain plenty of interesting tidbits, amusing stories, colorful characters, etc., but they tend to drag on. If you're looking for a treatise on humanity's relationship with its potential predators, this might not be the book for you.Here are some of Quammen's notable observations: * poor people tend to get eaten by animals more often than members of other classes * ""the extermination of alpha predators is fundamental to the colonial enterprise"" (p. 253 of the hard cover ed.) What better way to dominate an entire landscape (not just its people) than by destroying the most obviously powerful animal around? This also points toward the complex relationship between native peoples and their ""resident monsters."" Quammen makes clear that most people have a diverse array of opinions regarding their local man-eaters, but are they all equally defeated when these animals are destroyed by an invading power? Is it simply a show of strength, or is it really as symbolic as Quammen implies? * Being eaten and being killed are wholly different human experiences than being killed for food. The thought of falling off a cliff and subsequently being eaten by vultures is very different from the thought of being hunted and eaten by a cougar.Overall, this one's a skimmer. "
11,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey,4,"This was the first book I read by David Quammen, an author I've come to respect for all the outdoorsy articles he's written.This book has nothing to do with monsters or God, the title looks like a ham-handed job by the publishers. It is something of an anthropological take on societies living in close proximity with large predators. Along the way, it also deals with a little science and ecology of these large predators.Quammen tours quite a bit of the world, spending time in India with lions, crocs in Australia, brown bears in Romania, and ending the trip with Russian Amur tigers. But through out the book, more than the animals themselves, we have Quammen's interactions with indigenous peoples who've spent centuries with these predators, such as the Maldhari tribesmen: buffalo herdsmen who co-exist with lions in Gir National Park in western India.The sections on Romania and the Russian far-east also deal with quite a bit of recent history of these troubled regions. Quammen does a nice job weaving history, mythology and ecology with a good dose of healthy speculation that makes a gripping read.Throughout the book, Quammen makes a case for conservation of these species, marshalling evidence from ecological principles to plain sense-o-wunda. I was hooked from page one, although I might be biased since this book covered areas that I especially love reading about. Recommended but with caveats."
12,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289730-jeffrey-akiva-savett,3,"David Quammen is incredibly smart and is a gifted writer. On my ""to read"" shelf is his most recent book about the origin of global viruses and super-strains.That said, I was a bit disappointed by this book. There is nothing wrong with Quammen's writing or his argument; what I found sort of problematic was the actual subject matter as opposed to what the title suggested. Yes, Quammmen does discuss what it means to see ourselves as ""just another flavor of meat."" But when the subtitle of the book is ""the man-eating predator in the jungles of history and the mind,"" I expect an evenly balanced exploration of both parts--the jungle and the mind. That balance is absent. As an approximation, I would say that about 85% of this book is a VERY specific and detailed look at alpha predators and human beings living in close proximity in various communities throughout the world. I suppose I expected more literary analyses and socio and pscylogical explorations into our NEED to keep these ""man-eaters"" alive and our FEAR of doing so.Thus, my frustration with this book is based more upon my initial expectations than any inherent problem. If you're interested more in an anthopological look at communities in close proximity to alpha-predators and how that proximity affects both parties, this book is for you."
13,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13546014-christopher-saunders,5,"Another excellent work by nature writer David Quammen (Song of the Dodo, Flight of the Iguana, etc.), Monster of God examines the role that man-eating animals play in human culture and society. Quammen provides several chapter-length essays on a variety of beasts, accused or proved of feasting on humans: Indian lions, Siberian tigers, Romanian brown bears, Nile crocodiles and others. Through this episodic approach, Quammen examines folklore, myth and religious depictions of these creatures, how it spurred human development and mythology, and the treatment accorded to them across time. Often, they were hunted nearly to extinction; sometimes they were preserved, occasionally by those who previously hunted them. They became a fearsome obstacle to progress, an otherworldly menace or karmic justice passing judgment on humanity; conquering them became a sign of masculinity virility or cultural progress. In all cultures, these animals are accorded a strange mixture of reverence and terror, fear and respect: attention must be paid to any animal strong enough to topple Mankind from the top of the food chain. As Quammen shows, the awe they inspire hasn’t really changed over time: at the end of the day, however, they are merely animals living their lives, oblivious to (but impacted by) human myth-making. "
14,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334717-griggette,5,"Wildlife/natural history journalism at its best. Quammen examines several carniverous ""monsters"" that are facing extinction in their last remaining habitat--the Asian lion in India, the saltwater crocodile in India and Australia, the brown bear in Romania, and the Amura (aka Siberian) tiger in Russia--and their controversial relationship to humans throughout history. How do indigenous cultures vs. colonial cultures interact with indigenous flora and fauna? How can governments and local communities best live with these ""threatening"" creatures from economic, cultural, and biological standpoints? Quammen asks tough questions and dives in neck deep in his attempt to answer them, and ultimately asks--will there be top, keystone predators in the landscape 100 years from now? And why should we care if there are or aren't? Quammen keeps it professional and highly scientific/factual the entire time, which few wildlife writers manage to do...no PETA outbursts, or on the flip side, no crazed curses against carnivores. He interviews the people--hunters, trappers, farmers/herders, and wildlife biologists--who best know these creatures and presents a holistic view of wildlife."
15,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I enjoyed Quammen's Spillover more than this book, but that's not to say this wasn't an interesting read too. In a similar way to Spillover, Quammen takes the reader on a tour of the world. He doesn't just report on predators from afar, but goes to get close up and personal with them, and with the people who've really spent time in their environment. It's still a little difficult to believe he could understand these animals or even that way of life with such short exposures, but he did his research and spoke to the people who did know, which puts him ahead of people who theorise from afar.What I liked particularly about this one was that he pulled in threads of literature, history, sociology... all kinds of ways of understanding the complex impact alpha predators have on us, and the impact we have on them. It's obviously very human-centric still: all of these alpha predators have been impacted by human encroachment on their territory. I don't know if there's any alpha predator in the world not feeling human pressures, but the relationship seemed particularly close/fraught here, with the animals Quammen picked.It's a bit of a dense read, but still interesting."
16,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995771-shawn,3,"Clearly a good writer. Clearly a ""science and nature writer"". I was more fascinated, however, with what would possess a person to write about this subject matter than I was with anything written. I can see how this would appeal to those who love to read about the most minute details of predators, civilizations, the dichotomy between man and nature. But, for Me, I think I would have preferred seeing this in the form of a science and nature documentary -- Richard Attenborough's narration lending to the tension and excitement. As it was, I found it a bit of a slog and struggled to sustain enough interest to get through it. "
17,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460089-stephanie-mcgarrah,4,"I am not an ardent fan of natural history books, or any scientific scholarly works really. But when its done right I'm captivated. Monster of God is a beautifully conceived and written book dedicated to the creatures on this earth who have permanently etched themselves into human kinds psyche. The author traces the relationships between lions, crocodiles and other creatures who remind us that we're ""just meat"" to man's mythological worlds, while also detailing the history and real world implications for beasts forced to eek out a hard existence in their shrinking worlds. Despite their reputations, in terms of brutality Man is still the most fearsome animal in my estimation. "
18,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12733434-brian-griffith,5,"Quammen finds a maximal balance of focus and depth, raising universal questions through an examination of four animals in four environments. In each case, he reveals a whole world of history, myth, struggle, and balance between local people and wild animals. It's a clear-eyed look at the dangers and necessities of coexistence in an ever-more human-filled landscape. I was struck by the sheer courage of Indian villagers, Aboriginal Australian communities, Siberian forest workers, or Romanian pastoralists, as they try to balance saving deadly animals with protecting their own people. Quammen shows this challenge at close to it's most extreme, but the issues and insights he raises apply to every site of interaction between humans and their non-human neighbors. It's a book about the tough, practical, mentally challenging task of finding mutual accommodation with animals."
19,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1894213-jennifer-collins,4,"Quammen's exploration of predators and our relation to them is a study in history, observation, nature writing, travel, and conservation. His discussions move effortlessly between our contemporary relationships with predators and their habitats on to history, biology, ecology, and even sociology. With an eye toward bringing these creatures as well as their habitats to life for readers, he blends his understanding of science with a flare for travel writing, and the effect is a brilliant discussion of predators. From the back cover: ""As he journeys into their habitats and confronts them where they live, Quammen reflects on the enduring significance of these predators to us and imagines a future without them."" It seems clear, though, that a future without them is one of the things this book is desperately fighting against.Whether discussing bears, lions, tigers, or crocodiles, the work here is impressive. It is not an easy read, certainly--there's research packed into every page, and many of the subjects are serious (potentially nightmare-inducing for animal lovers, too, in some cases), but this is a worthwhile and beautifully written book that honors some of Earth's greatest creatures in a way that deserves notice.Absolutely recommended."
20,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102888-michael-vanzandt,2,"This book suffered from my own high expectations and misconceptions. Quammen provides a broad scope for his work. His work focuses on four very interesting locales -- Gir forest of India, a Udege reservation in eastern Russia, northern Australia and Romania. The book is a synthesis of biology, environmental studies, political science. It is an enjoyable but it's potential is limited by Quammen's desire to make a book for the mainstream public. The promise of the book is short-circuited and does not delve into the role of the alpha-predator in the human psyche throughout the evolution of homo sapiens. The book's high mark comes when Quammen discusses the influence of the predator in legends such as Gilgamesh, Beowulf, et al. For the most part, it reads like a elegy of the ""man-eating"" predators, offering little optimism or solutions. A decent read. I recommend it, but nothing extraordinary. "
21,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9475936-rachael,5,"""Great and terrible flesh-eating beasts have always shared landscape with humans."" From the first sentence, David Quammen begins weaving a tale of interdependency, fear, adoration and conflict between Homo sapiens and apex predators throughout human history. As he travels from around the world meeting village elders, conservationists, hunters and laymen, Quammen addresses the convoluted factors that have previously, and continue, to plague our existence alongside the top predators in the world - predators that occasionally see us as simply another delicacy on the menu. Masterfully walking a thin, delicate line, he delivers first-hand accounts, mythological excerpts and academic research in an engaging, comedic voice while allowing readers to develop their own conclusions concerning conservation efforts and the future of his featured species: Asiatic lions, crocodiles, brown bears, and tigers."
22,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10434298-steve,5,"A charming, meditative book that ambles through reporting on how modern societies live near alpha predators with wanderings through philosophical, historical, and sociological musings.I normally prefer my non-fiction focused and clear, setting up a hypothesis or story and, straightforward, setting about proving it with rigor and education. Quammen works differently, taking the reader on the journey with him, asking questions he's not sure the answer to, leading you through the twisting paths of the scenic route.You're left with a sense of wonder, a sense of the marvel and hugeness of nature, and with a beautiful discourse that fosters a sense of discovery.It creates a solid foundation that you feel could run off in so many directions, and leaves you with a strong sense of appreciation of people, animals, and exploration.

The sheer volume of information is staggering, so much that I found myself skipping ahead at parts, reading the end of the book, and then making my way through chapters backwards. David Quammen is nothing if not thorough, and this book covers a lot of interdisciplinary ground. Much more of the book than I expected is devoted to the specifics of various conservation efforts and geographical history, and this became a bit daunting at times when I found myself wanting to get to the *meat* of it all, but I chalk this up to personal taste. The parts that I found less interesting might be the most interesting parts to other readers.Still a fascinating book and I'll be picking up another one of Quammen's soon."
24,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361844-elizabeth,5,"This wide-ranging, thought provoking book takes the reader all over the world to examine predators who, usually when provoked, prey on humans: crocodiles, lions and tigers in India, tigers in Siberia, to name a few. There's also a discussion about animals and religion, over population by people, and science fiction. it's well researched and exhaustive. My only criticism is that it has too much information--this book could have been divided in two or three. However, the infordmation was most interesting and well worth my time.

I don't agree with the name (I think alpha-predators is rather daunty and obsolete), but I can't seem to find anything wrong with his book apart from the ocasional wtf comment on a specific subject or some really vague hints on casual sexism - which, I know, problematic, but the book was written in 2003 and Quammen can't be an all perfect writer in every sense. He was also truly, radically against Communism, as his passages on Romanian's bear and Russia's tigers show.Quammen travels the whole world, from the warms of India and Australia to the chilly freezing winds of Far East Russia, to find those big, majestic, imponent animals that govern many aspects of our fears and nightmares. Sometimes they are depicted godly and almost surreal, and sometimes as they are: animals. Not morally conductive, not guarded by a set of human rules; just simple animals governmed by ecology.As an all-time favorite science communication writer, Quammen could have not let me down, but I might have to put this one right beside my first favourite one, ""The Song of the Dodo"". It is truly a masterpiece. From discourses on human political motivations to gloomy observations on nature's demise and incredible twists on Ridley Scott's 'Alien', Quammen is a must to anyone. And his message was never so important."

I was expecting to enjoy reading about lions - but the chapters about the lions were more about the local people and the politics of conservation and less than I expected about the lions.The chapters about crocodiles were better, more crocs and the struggles faced by the locals. Still, I was finding it difficult to continue - and I usually love David Quammen's writing. However, I was saved by the bears, Amur tigers and Grendel.These chapters seemed more interesting - maybe it is because the history of the Romanian dictator Caecescu was something I remembered although I had no idea he hunted bears. The dip into mythology with Beowulf and Grendel was incredibly interesting (but I have a soft spot for myths and legends) and as for the tigers...This is a long book, perhaps harder to read because I found it difficult to remember some of the place names in India and Australia which meant I had to keep referring back to the map. But, it was worth sticking with for the second half. This is a book that is part nature and part an examination of our relationship with carnivores / man-eaters and our own mortality."

There are some nice discussions about the role of predators, both real and imagined, in the history of humans. And he devotes several enlightening chapters on how the alpha predators create balance in the scheme of life. My main takeaway message here is that many cultures have learned to live in harmony with alpha predators. Except the white, man, it seems, who needs to exterminate any perceived four-legged threat. And therein lies the forecast-- by 2150 there will be no more wild alpha predators. Where the books bogs down is when Quammen, goes off on tangents recounting every single incident of beast eats human that he could find in his notes. He could have condensed or stricken many of these stories and still made his point."

But it's interesting to remember that the old dark woods weren't empty of inspiration. And it's dreary to reflect that the twentieth century's most notorious avatar of the Beowulf figure - chieftain, heroic slayer of monsters, wise king - was a megalomaniacal little Communist martinet who required underlings to load his rifles and stretch his pelts.""

37,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind. David Quammen, one is not surprised to learn, lives in Montana. The dust jacket picture shows him dressed for cold weather, with a mustache and just the right amount of grey hair to look grizzled. Writers whose topic of choice is biological science can be divided into two archetypal groups: the ones who peer through a microscope at a dissected insect, and the ones who go on snowmobiles into Siberia to catch a glimpse of tigers in winter. Quammen is most decidedly in the latter group.This is not to say that he's not up to the more technical side of things. His analysis of Darwin and his thinking leading up to ""The Origin of Species"" (in his book ""The Reluctant Mr. Darwin"") was careful and obviously showed a great deal of time spent poring over Darwin's notebooks and letters rather than flying to the Galapagos. But Quammen's objective here is lions in India, bears in Romania, tigers in Siberia, and crocodiles in Australia, What do these have in common? They are among the last places on earth where there is still a population of ""alpha predators"", who from time to time occasionally prey on the humans who live among them.They are also, not coincidentally, all either currently endangered or only very recently pulled back from the brink of extinction. Humans do not take well to the prospect of being eaten, and one of the points that Quammen makes several times in this book is how this provokes an even fiercer response than the risk of merely being killed. We are relatively newly perched atop the food chain, and not so long ago in evolutionary terms we were as worried about being prey as about hunting it. One of the first things humans do upon receiving the fruits of technology, is to set about killing every alpha predator in the area.Quammen finds other evidence of the unique place of alpha predators in the human psyche. One example is the bizarre obsession with bear-hunting by the late (unlamented) Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who sat in a chair and had bear (who had been fed by humans to bulk them up) driven into his gunsights by the dozens in some cases. What such a ""shooting fish in a barrel"" demonstration could possibly have signified in his mind is hard to imagine, but apparently it had something to do with the ideal of the Mighty Hunter as alpha male. Ceausescu's fall from power in 1989 was particularly spectacular, and I couldn't help thinking it was poetic justice for him to meet his end at a firing squad, after a mock trial every bit as much of a sham as his ""hunting"".Not uncommonly, the relations between humans and alpha predators also involve the relations between one group of humans and another, smaller and aboriginal group of humans. It is one of the most poignant points of Quammen's analysis that alpha predators tend to prey on the very young, the very old, the sick, the weak, and the poor. Rarely are rich young men eaten, more often destitute mothers and infants. The importance of preserving a nearly extinct species may seem very different to environmentalists in the capital and the poor indigenous folk who worry about their attacks. It is in the nature of every species, even alpha predators (and even humans) to overproduce, and let some of each generation fail and starve. Inevitably, those alpha predators and those humans who are driven to the edges of their respective species' territory will encounter one another, and this will end badly for one or the other.Equally important to know, however, is the role alpha predators play as ""keystone species"", a term Quammen concedes has been overused but which is justified for alpha predators if it is for anyone. Species which have no predators, but which are not themselves alpha predators, will quickly reproduce to unsustainable numbers. For some species (e.g. deer in North America), man has stepped into the role of predator, and Quammen interviews hunters (and herders, who are often the same people) in India, Australia, and Siberia. Their attitudes towards the alpha predators in their midst are complex and varied, and Quammen resists the urge to force them all into one mold, instead acknowledging the difference between cultures and between people within a culture towards to the idea of living in the vicinity of a wild, potentially humanivorous beast.Ultimately, it is hard to believe that wild alpha predators will be able to last past the current century. At best, they may be farmed in outdoor ranches, more like livestock than wild. Just as likely, they may be seen only in zoos or museums. Either way, we can be glad that Quammen has done us the favor of seeking out the wild variety, and the people who live in its midst, while they still exist. Quammen does so with equal parts wit and keen insight, and his book is well worth seeking out."
38,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7548918-dean-hamilton,5,"Walking downtown one day, a number of years ago, I was startled by a massive tawny head that peered around a concrete pillar and regarded me with a baleful, quizzical yellow glare. You don't generally expect to run into a full-grown African lion in the heart of a teeming metropolis. I stopped dead, an act that attracted its immediate attention, despite the more jaded urbanites that crowded the sidewalk and barely glanced at this apparition of the savannah as they passed. There is something about being the focus of a predator's gaze that puts a particular tingle in your day. Somewhere, buried very deep is that primodial recognition that there, but for the grace of God, go you....Monster of God is a look at the role of the predator, in nature and in the mind of humanity, and the tenuous borders where the two uneasily mix. Author David Quammen looks at four ""alpha"" predators, creatures that live at the very apex of the food chain: The Gir lions of India, the crocodiles of Asia, Africa and Australia, the brown bear in Romania, and the Amur Siberian tigers of Asia. Monster of God looks at the relationship that the predator has with man, the social and cultural role of the predator, its key position within the natural world, and the deleterious impact the the burgeoning human population is having on the predator's environment. Monster of God is a thoughtful, intelligent and highly readable examination of how humanity lives with predators. Quammen looks at what is the acceptable role in today's world for violent, essentially dangerous animals that can and quite readily do, kill people for food, their position as ""keystone"" species on the food chain, their position as totemic symbols within human history, language and culture (think about it, even today people are ""lionized"") and how economic realities of hunting and farming may shape their future. He examines the disparities that exist across the world in attitudes towards alpha predators, particularly noting the fact that where predators and people most often, most tellingly meet, is among the poorer marginal fringes of human society, left to deal with the beasts that haunt the dark nights and quiet waterways. It's easy to say ""save the tigers"" when you don't have to cut wood in the forest to earn a living, or walk a cold trapline to support your family, hoping not to run into something hungry and toothy. Here's a brief excerpt: ""Great and terrible flesh-eating beasts have always shared landscape with humans. They were part of the ecological matrix within which Homo sapiens evolved. They were part of the psychological context in which our sense of identity as a species arose. They were part of the spiritual systems we invented for coping. The teeth of big predators, their claws, their ferocity and their hunger, were grim realities that could be eluded but not forgotten. Every once in a while, a monsterous carnivore emerged like doom from a forest or a river to kill someone and feed on the body. It was a familiar sort of disaster - like auto fatalities today - that must have seemed freshly, shockingly gruesome each time, despite the familiarity. And it conveyed a certain message. Among the earliest forms of human self-awareness was the awareness of being meat.""One of the interesting facts that Quammen touches upon in his book is the hunting excesses of Romanian Communist strongman Ceausescu, who was notorious for, among other things, turning Romania's wildlife managment system into his own personal game shooting park, slaughtering every large beast that came within reach, including 24 brown bears in a single day.Finally, if you have a literary turn, you can always peruse the quintessential story of man versus monster - the tale of Beowulf, King of the Geats, in his rending, bloody battle with the fearsome Grendal...My downtown lion? He was being used to advertise some new boutique that was opening. I don't recall the name of the store, but I will long remember the grace, dignity, strength and banked, predatory gaze of that lion...even though he was sprawled across a mailbox of all things..."
39,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline,3,"Whether through an error in my judgement or misleading advertising, this book wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting an exploration of the role and symbolism of alpha predators in religion, mythology and culture throughout history - certainly to me that is what the title implies. And the early chapters seemed to promise this, discussing the frequent references to lions in the Bible, the sacred roles given to bulls, crocodiles, lions in Egyptian hieroglyphs, shark worship on Pacific islands. But other than this all too brief exploration, with an occasional asides to discuss the Biblical Leviathan, Beowulf's Grendel, Humbaba in the Epic of Gilgamesh and, curiously, the alien in the Alien series, the rest of this book is devoted to exploring the relationship between a handful of native cultures and the alpha predators they share a landscape with.So whilst I was disappointed this book wasn't what I'd been hoping for, I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. Quammen is an engaging writer and I enjoyed his recounting of his own adventures tracking Australian saltwater crocodiles, Indian lions, Romanian bears and Siberian tigers just as much as I enjoyed the insights into the cultures that exist alongside these predators. Mainstream urbanised humanity has become all too detached from the ecosystems of which we are a part - how many of us, after all, think of ourselves as being part of the food-chain? In the pyramid of alpha predators, by and large Man is most firmly at the top. But remove our technological advantages, remove our guns and our vehicles and our scientific understanding, put us alone and on foot in a predator's territory, and our pretensions to Alpha status prove all too hollow. We become Prey.However, as Quammen investigates, the cultures and societies that live most closely alongside alpha predators often develop a respect and an accommodation for them, despite frequently competing with them for food and territory or clashing over livestock depredations. The biggest threat to these creatures is not the individuals who live in closest proximity to them, but the voracious consumption of resources by the increasing encroachment of civilisation. The last few pockets of territory in which these creatures, lions and tigers and bear (oh my!), can live wild and free is rapidly shrinking. And another concern, as Quammen points out, is that those native culture may vanish right along with them.So a good book, but not the book I was hoping to read. If you're looking for an in-depth investigation of the deep-rooted fear of alpha predators in the human psyche or an exploration of how these fears have been expressed through the millennia via religion, literature and art, you'll enjoy this book certainly but it won't quite be the book you're looking for. Too much of the present and not enough of the past for me. I'm glad I read it, and I'm sure I'll read more of David Quammen's work, but for now I'll keep looking."
40,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4706292-adam-wiggins,4,"In a mix of naturalism, mythological and historical analysis, and conservationism, this book looks at mankind's relationship with the world's large predators. It primarily focuses on the Indian lion (from the Gir region), the Romanian brown bear (from the snowy Carpathian mountains), the saltwater crocodile (in Australia), and the Siberian tiger (in the Russian far east).Each tier of the food chain is correspondingly smaller than the one below it: the total biomass of microbial life is an order of magnitude smaller than plants, which in term is an order of magnitude smaller than herbivores, and so on up until you reach creatures like lions, crocodiles, and bears. That makes these creatures correspondingly rare, and also the most likely to disappear as mankind takes over more of the earth.It's easy for first-world citizens, sitting safe in their living rooms, to admire the grace and beauty of alpha predators via documentaries and call for their conservation. It tends to be the world's poorest people who live adjacent to the territories of these animals, and they are the ones who bear the cost of their conservation (what Quammen calls ""the muskrat conundrum""). Preserving them may require redistributing the costs in some way.One approach, executed successfully in certain areas of Australia with the crocodile, is to allow harvesting of products from these animals. For example, crocodile belly skin fetches a good price on the international market, and unhatched crocodile eggs can be sold to zoos and crocodile farms. Some conservationists argue that complete protection can turn out to be harmful for the species, since locals will come to resent the creatures that give them no benefit, but incur costs in the form of eaten livestock or even injury and death to children and adults in the area.The fascination with man-eating predators throughout history and culture is another area Quammen spends time on. Civilization's earliest recorded stories, such as Gilgamesh and Beowulf, center around man-eating monsters and heroes that battle them. The Chauvet Cave in France contains paintings showing lions as noble, beautiful creatures, not merely monsters to be feared, dating back 35,000 years. Humans find beauty, mystery, and intrigue in man-eating predators that they don't find in merely deadly animals, such as toxic snakes, spiders, or elephants (who are responsible for far more deaths than lions or bears are). Something about the prospect of being killed and eaten is far more bone-chilling than simply being killed."
41,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9852546-terry,4,"I enjoyed this book because of its passion for travel and ecology. Quammen begins by following lions in western India then moves to Indian crocodiles. Crocs soon bring him to Aboriginal Arnhem land where he finds similar values between man and the alpha predators. Both the threatened lions and crocs are living with an ethnic minority but tolerated by the distant and more politically powerful majority. The Indian Maldhari and the Aborigines who live closely with the predators value them for more than their hide’s worth, but they have obvious economic concerns. Should these rare animals be farmed to aid their conservation? We move from Australia to the the Romanian Carpathian mountains investigating brown bears in the years between the fall of communism and today. The Carpathian bears have been carefully managed but Ceaușescu shot many while he was Romania’s evil leader. The bears’ place in man’s political psyche, the part which enjoys power and killing, whether because he’s president or because he can afford it in today’s new capitalistic system, is examined. In contrast, the Romanian herders who live closest to the bears have a relationship similar to the tribespeople living with the lions and crocs — they respect and keep their distance. Finally, we travel with Quammen to the expansive Russian Far East to investigate the few hundred Amur tigers. Here, Quammen talks with fur trappers and hunters. It is interesting how all these different cultures somehow balance economic opportunities with a realistic reverence for the animals’ important place in their environment.Throughout all this well told story, we see how alpha predators play in the mind of the people who live closest with the animals. These predators are not often gods but they hold a similar powerful and ultimate punishing threat. They have evolved with man and now live at man’s whim, for a short while longer, serving an important part in ecology. The few chapters describing the 30,000 year old Chauvet cave paintings are intriguing because they prove that this relationship is ancient although the balances are different today. When man irretrievably looses this small reminder of our own connection with the natural world our lives will be vastly impoverished."
42,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12606069-david-blinn,0,"Sorry for the incomplete review, I wrote this a while back with the intention of finishing later, but never did so there are a few holes in what I wrote below.It's Big Cat Week on the NatGeo Wild television channel, and I'm watching a program called ""The Unlikely Leopard"". It follows a young African leopard in Botswana, telling the story of his mother's attempt to raise him and his subsequent coming of age. With the warm menace of the evil Uncle Scar from ""The Lion King"", the narrator opens the program by telling me that a young male member of Panthera Pardus Pardus like this has one in six odds of surviving. Yes, this is an unlikely leopard, but his odds are better by far than some of the members of the man eating species covered in David Quammen's Monster of God.""Alpha predators"", Quammen's term for animals big enough and dangerous enough toat least occasionally kill and eat human beings, are the putative subject of Monster of God,but sharing equal time in the spotlight is the most dangerous game, man. The bookis focused mainly on the few spaces left in the world where man and wild beastare still thrown together and struggle to survive in the presence of the other. Whateffects do these animals have on human beings, and what effects do human beings haveon these animals? It's a big-hearted work, full of compassion both for the animals and the people who must live with them. It even apologizes for the single math equation it includes.Which brings me back, in conclusion, to Big Cat Week. It's easy to appreciate the grace and violence of these alpha predators from the distance and comfort of my television. It's easy to root for the underdog when the underdog isn't your adversary. As Monster of God makes clear, the relationship is much more nuanced and uneasy when you or your children or the animals that constitute your livlihood are on their menu. There are no easy answers, Quammen tell us. But here's to hoping we find them, and that we can still make new episodes of Big Cat Week in 2150. "
43,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"In Monster of God David Quammen uses the organizing principle of “great and terrible flesh-eating beasts” (i.e. animals that can, and sometimes do eat people) to examine the history, natural history and present day realities of these creatures. These include the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) or Indian Lion (which is found only in the Gir Forest of Gujarat, India), the salt water crocodile (of India and Australia), the brown bear (Romania), and the Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris altaica).Far from being a sensationalist account of man-eating monsters, Quammen investigates what we know about these large predators, including the ecological pressures caused by loss of habitat and human encroachment. The question that arises, is whether these animals will continue to survive in the wild. Unfortunately, the prognosis is poor.Due to the structure of the food web, large predators are necessarily some of the rarest animals to be found in nature. They are thus more prone to extinction as a result of environmental changes. Humans, with their swelling populations, are putting intense pressure on many previously wild areas. The animals that Quammen examines still survive in the wild, but the conditions on the ground are unsettling. Brown bears are protected so that they can be shot by the highest bidder. Crocodiles may only be able to survive in some areas if they can be harvested for their skin. Tigers are being poached for the black market trade in traditional (i.e. nonsensical) medicine. And everywhere there are increasing conflicts with humans as wild areas are diminished. Predators are often keystone species. Their disappearance could cause irreversible changes in the ecosystems they once inhabited. We will also have lost something less tangible. Edward Abbey said it best when he wrote “The essence of true wilderness is big mammals that can eat you.” In the absence of these big mammals, we will have lost the essence of true wilderness. "
44,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5377232-janet,3,"In Monster of God, Quammen explores the stories of four dangerous alpha predators: the lions of Gir (India), crocodiles (Australia), bears (Romania), and the Amar tiger (Siberia). Quammen mixes regional history and anthropology, the history of man-animal interaction and current environmental policy and practice into his travelogue. While Quammen is keenly interested in people's interactions with and attitudes about animals, there is surprisingly little about the animals themselves (ethology, ecology). National Geographic Wild this is not -- even predator-prey interactions are described with a policy analyst's remove. Therefore as a reader you never feel man-eating predators breathing down your neck. Despite the title, Quammen doesn't have much new to add to discussion of the psychology of human response to man-eating predators. His ideas - that being eaten is a greater desecration that being simply killed by an animal, and that killing alpha predators is part of conquering and taming a landscape - strike me as self-evident. Plodding prose and ponderous declamation of the obvious can be a bit boring, but the intermittent apt and deftly phrased sentences keep me from being too irritated with his style. Overall, if you lay aside any preconceptions about what you expect to be in this book, and are in the mood for a slow, informative read, you are sure to learn something new and interesting from Monster of God."

It's got a lot of the hallmarks of books I love: it's cleverly written; it's about animals; and it's filled with tons of interesting facts. However, it was a bit of a slog for me. I found it interesting enough to keep reading it, but not interesting enough that I was transfixed to the page wanting to find out what happened next. Perhaps it was that the book felt disjointed. I never really understood why the particular animals Quammen was writing about were chosen. The sections of the book seemed only loosely related to one another; I couldn't figure out why he would just move from one place to another.The last part of the book was the best, filled with interesting facts about teeth and extinction and history. It also paints a gloomy scenario for these amazing big predators and the rest of the world that left me feeling sad.One last quibble. Though the prose was wonderfully descriptive, I wish in some cases, there had been illustrations. For example, illustrations of the different teeth would have been lovely.All-in-all, this book was interesting enough for me to request another Quammen from the library."
46,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101475-jamie,5,"Journalist David Quammenn seems to live (at least in this book) a kind of Indiana-Jones-as-a-naturalist lifestyle that that allows him to travel to remote corners of the earth (Romania, far-east Siberia, the Kathiawar peninsula in India, the Brahmani-Baitarani Delta off the Bay of Bengal, Kakadu National Park in northern Australia) to explore the wide ranging topic of man-eating predators. Not only do we get lions, tigers and bears, but crocodiles as well. Awesome.All the jet-setting around the world, camping down with local researchers and their native contacts would probably get annoying if it weren't all covered in the ridiculous amount of thought and research that Quammen puts into the subject. Of particular interest is his exploring of all the different conceptions and reactions to large scale predators among local people, from deep rooted respect for certain boundaries between species to trophy hunting to revenge to seeing large predators as an expression of divine punishment. He also writes lucidly and clearly about predators roles within ecosystems, local economies, plus theology and mythology. Whew. Did I mention he's a great writer and storyteller? Man, just writing about it makes me more verbose and long-winded."
47,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7370729-christopher-hivner,5,"David Quammen takes the reader to India, Australia, Romania and Siberia to study four of the Earth’s greatest predators: lion, tiger, crocodile and bear. He studies the complex relationship between all animals in the food cycle and the even more convoluted relationship of these sometimes man-eaters to humans, the ultimate predator. Besides lengthy historical notations on the animals’ evolution and descriptions of physical attributes, Quammen also gives deep and telling information on the countries and provinces involved. This includes politics, original settlement of the areas and of the native peoples. The author obviously spent a lot of time in the wild studying the species. In each country he met many people along the way to act as guides, storytellers and hunters. It is Quammen’s intimacy with these people that make this book different from any other of its type I’ve read. His descriptions of them not only physically but also in personality and speech make you feel like you know them. You can almost hear their voices as you read their stories of encounters with a tiger or lion. When he goes crocodile hunting in Australia you can hear the boat’s engine and feel the spray of the water hitting you. Monster of God is an excellent book, fascinating from beginning to end."

The future of these man- and livestock-eating predators is not terribly bright, given that the population of India and the world in general is growing (that of Romania is falling, though), and all these people want goods made from the natural resources extracted from the habitats of these predators. Paradoxically, if there is demand for hunting these animals, the way Nicolae CeauÅŸescu hunted brown bears, or the Australians hunt crocodiles to make crocodile-skin leather goods, this gives the locals an incentive not to exterminate them all. One small nitpick: the language spoken in Orissa is Oriya, not Oriyan, the natives of Orissa are Orissans, not Oriyans, and a native of Tamil Nadu is a Tamil, not a Tamilian. I also wish he had quoted from Viktor Pelevin when discussing Nicolae Ceauşescu's bear hunts with Muammar Gaddafi."
49,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927018-patricia,4,"For a start, an excellent bibliography for anyone interested in the subject. My interest was in Amur tigers but I couldn't help but continue reading about the other alpha predators Quammen chronicles--brown bears, Komodo dragons, lions, great white sharks…. I enjoyed the combination of myth, history and first-person adventure, and found the author's insights and musings very thought-provoking--for example, his idea that perhaps the eradication of these alpha predators is a predictable part of the colonization process (where newcomers to a geography feel the need to exterminate those elements they find fearful). In short, the book is thoughtful and while some biological details are included, offers a wider scope of information than one usually finds in works on man-eaters. It's not just Jim Corbett-type tales (which I grew up on and still love to read), but Quammen's ruminations on why, for example, Beowulf ""hits harder"" than other tales--a chapter I wish I had read back in college while reading this Old English poem--that turned this book into a page-turner for me (which frankly I did not expect it to be beyond the chapter on tigers). Well done!"
50,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/737199-eric,5,"Very easily one of the best books I've ever ready.Now this is not a book for someone with little time. This book is very poorly written; my high school English teacher would wince at the structure of the paragraphs and chapters. The author very clearly has some amazing stories to tell. After finishing the book, you feel as though you've been granted access to some of his most treasured memories. That said, the book meanders from topic to topic. It is hard to follow central themes of a chapter.None of this matters because the stories are so compelling that you get lost in the moment. It's only at the end of a chapter when you think back at what the last chapter was about that you realize how many disparate topics were in it.All in all, the book is based on a compelling idea - an exploration of man's relationship to the natural world by being prey. Quammen looks at several instances from Eastern Europe, Siberia to India and Australia. In each of these instances, you become more informed in the most pleasant way - through some great storytelling."
51,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95947-jean,4,"This book took me a ridiculously long time to read (1.5 years), but I wouldn't let that count against it. The material is very science based, and when I have to spend a large portion of my time reading scientific articles, picking up a book that is focused on summarizing scientific findings for a general audience isn't always appealing. However, I was impressed by David Quammen's writing skills, vocabulary (GRE words anyone?) and the topic was intriguing. I think he did a good job balancing the sciencey stuff with interesting stories and I also appreciated his respect for the people he worked with. Weird story... the night I finished the book, I read an article for class: Terborgh et al. 2001 published in Science called ""Ecological Meltdown in Predator-Free Forest Fragments"". After I finished that reading I picked up Monster of God. I read about 3 pages and on page 421 Quammen summarizes Terborgh et al. 2001. Weird. What are the chances of that when I have been reading this book since June 2010. "
52,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/657873-summer,5,"I came across a review of this book around the time I decided to rewrite To Bridle a Dragon - and immediately knew I had to read it. Quammen's book compares the lore about man-eating predators with the behavior of the real animals. In literature, predators eat the unholy and the feckless. In real life, they eat those least able to defend themselves. Efforts to preserve endangered predators are often met with resistance from those who risk death sharing the land with them.The gorgeously written book rambles through jungles real and imagined - through Beowulf and the Aliens movies, through a lion preserve in India and bikers' croc-hunting ground in Australia. Monster of God has been criticized because it doesn't provide the sort of 'aha!' moment that the author's acclaimed Song of the Dodo does. But Quammen realistically addresses a sticky problem in which there are no clean solutions."
53,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211697-michael-oliver,4,"David Quamman serves up a scientific look into the survival and nature of the (what he refers to as) Alpha Predators, more specifically, man-eaters. We get up-close and personal with Gir lions, salt-water crocodiles (Australia), Carpathian bears (Romania), and the Siberian tiger (Russia). <-- which David informs us, are not the white and black tigers... in fact, the white and black tigers don't appear in any specific subspecies and are very rare in nature. It is a genetic disposition that causes the lack of pigment in the fur. Zookeepers in India and soon all over the world desperately tried to crossbreed these albino Bengal tigers and then continued inbreeding the albinos until there were very many. Siegfried and Roy popularized the animals (if you look closely, the white and black ones tend to be cross-eyed due to inbreeding). This is just a taste of some of the things you'll learn in this magnificently boring, but totally informational text."
54,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1047294-mari,5,"it is so far a very well written research book or narrative of a person's experience in portraying the issues that are affecting the populations of large predatory felines and other large animals (bears, alligators). There are many accounts and references to other large predatory animals that are unfortunately characterized as man-eating which then makes them become greater targets into the perils of extinction. I believe Quanmen's attempt is to have Homo-sapiens realize that we ourselves are the true monsters destroying God's beauty that is set forth in this planetary world. For that, I give him and many other researchers and conservationists respect for what they are doing in preserving and in hopes of saving whatever wild life we have left from people who continue to believe that capitalism, consumerism, and the destruction of tradition for a more modernized lifestyle is the way towards inner happiness. "
55,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8254203-benjamin-kahn,4,"Really good coverage of disappearing predators around the world. Quammen does a great job of examining declining predators and the people who live near them. Although some of his more philosophical thoughts on our relationship with large predators and man-eaters didn't really strike much of a chord with me, I thought he succeeded in thoroughly exploring all the issues surrounding the continued existence of these creatures.Quammen studies four predators - lions in India, crocodiles in India and Australia, bears in Romania and tigers in Russia. He discusses their history, interviews ecologists in the field as well as the people who live close to these predators and are most affected by them. He examines the economics as well as the ecological impact of their decline or their resurgence. Even a chapter on the teeth of the various predators was much more interesting than I initially expected. A fascinating and informative read."
56,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4641394-jason-kirk,4,"""My theory--really only a notion--is that the extermination of alpha predators is fundamental to the colonial enterprise, wherever that enterprise occurs. It's a crucial part of the process whereby an invading people, with their alien forms of weaponry and organized power, their estrangement from both the homeland they've left and the place where they've fetched up, their detachment and ignorance and fear and (in compensation for those sources of anxiety) their sense of cultural superiority, seize hold of an already occupied landscape and presume to make it their own... It's one aspect of a campaign by which the interlopers, the stealers of landscape, try to make themselves comfortable, safe, and supreme in unfamiliar surroundings... You haven't conquered a people, and their place, until you've exterminated their resident monsters."" --David Quammen, 
Monster of God
"
57,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244048-kelly,4,"David Quammen is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Another excellent book (though not quite as good as Song of the Dodo and Spillover, hence the four star rating). Monster of God is about the alpha predators, the animals that have been known to not only kill people but also devour them. Those of us who live in cities far away from these animals, it is easy for us to say how important it is to protect them and save them from extinction. Yet there are people who have to live among them and live in terror of losing a dog, cattle, or even a loved one. Quammen travels to four different parts of the world to find out how people are living with such magnificent and sometimes deadly predators. He covers the Asiatic lions in India, crocodiles in Australia, brown bears in Romania, and Amur tigers in the Russian Far East. His adventures are, as usual, filled with humor, natural history lessons, and some really interesting characters. "
58,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,4,"Oh I waffled over 4 or 5 stars for far too long. Call it a 4.5.This book is kind of all over the place -- it's more a series of vignettes than a cohesive narrative across the whole book (the face that I read it as time allowed over the course of a year probably adds to this impression). That being said, I learned a TON reading this, nearly every story was new to me or had some new perspective to it. Quammen selects several specific species to explore and seems to choose a deep rabbit hole or two a random to go down for each one. This means that you get a detailed history of a very particular location or population (which is cool, if sometimes a little dense), but not quite anything that ties it all together. I love the approach of tying current conservation issues into their modern and historical cultural context, something that isn't done nearly enough. There's a lot of food for thought and discussion here. "
59,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177534-matt,3,"Despite having this book recommended to me a decade ago, I only came to read it after reading John Vaillant's marvelous ""The Tiger"". Quammen's book touches on the same region at the very of of ""Monster of God,"" but before we get there we've got three long trips through the forest of Gir in India (where the Indian lion barely hangs on to life), crocodile country in northern Australia, brown bear territory of Romania. Each touches on the psychology, philosophy, and religious undergirding that life among man-eating predators bestows on cultures, but on the whole I felt that each was a bit less than what the whole promised.I'm probably biased because Vaillant's book reads like a true-crime thriller (which, of course, it is), but Quammen's book felt overlong and a bit too academic or hands-off. It's still interesting and educational, but I really wanted it to go deeper on any of these four regions and predators, and shave off a hundred pages or so of length."
60,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269679-jellylama,3,"A fantastic concept that probably held up better over a plate of dal bat than in the boards of a 450-page book. I loved the first 150 pages -- wonderfully argued and researched, but then my enthusiasm slowed as the writing did; at less than half-past it became redundant and thesis-driven. Still, a wonderful way to think about that ancient struggle -- the one that tired old school teachers call ""man vs. nature"" as they put everyone in the room to sleep. ""Yeh,"" I'd like to remind my ninth grade English teacher, ""animals can eat you."" Though it seems to me that they always eat the wrong people. I'm sure I could produce a solid list of eco-wrong-doers that are more deserving of being food than most of the village-dwellers that end up in the belly of the beast. In the end, the overall best part of this book might be the Walton Ford watercolor on the cover."
61,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,2,"Though I LOVED Song of the Dodo, this one just didn't work for me. I think the theme is not as tightly constructed. The first section was all about lions in India, then Quammen abruptly jumps subjects in the second section. That was about where I left off -- without an idea of where he was going I felt like he was just rambling.To be fair, I think this is a collection of individual writings, perhaps originally a series of articles. If that is so, then the lack of linear theme is understandable. Doesn't mean I'll finish the book, but at least it makes some sense. If this was also the case for Dodo, then Quammen did a better job of tying the pieces together in that case. Overall, worth a try, but not as good as Dodo."
62,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1222908-brad-bakove,4,"David Quammen is one of those guys that just amaze me. Rhodes scholar, degreed from Yale & Oxford in literature, he writes science oriented stuff with the depth and enthusiasm of a visitor excited to be there and interested in doing the research to get the whole story. That his writing is usually clear and ofter incredibly beautiful & thought-provoking is a bonus liberally given.MOG is about the historical/current interrelationship between the world alpha predators, lions & tigers & bears (oh my! And crocs, too), how has the presence of these guys shaped our culture and how have we shaped their's.Though it's a mod-long read, it's a fascinating and informative look at how we can to be who we are. Beautifully done."
63,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,4,"This is a book about (Asiatic) lions and (Amur/Siberian) tigers and (European brown) bears (as well as saltwater crocodiles), oh my! Quammen takes an interesting and thorough look at these apex predators, their roles in the ecosystem, their relationships with native peoples and how that has been affected by the encroachment of the ""modern"" world, as well as the outlook for the species' long-term survival. One interesting thread connecting these particular predators is that they have all been known to consume humans, and the author explores how being eaten happens to be a very primal fear in humans, and how that colors our opinion of certain animals.However, I don't understand how the first part of the title, Monster of God, relates to the book."
64,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17296389-cyndie-courtney,2,"What I expected of this book: A book about apex predators and how their biology and human interactions led to how we portray them in mythology and society.What this book is: A description of small out of the way tribes of people who still live in the midst of predators, the history of those groups (esp. political history), and a small amount of how those predators fit into the religion or spirituality of those specific groups. Occasional forays into mytology or predator biology.The book is much more about people than it is about the predators. Written more like a history or anthropology book than like a popular science or biology book. I'm sure there are many who would enjoy it - it was just not at all what I was looking for and quite long. "
65,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7945180-rosey-waters,3,"How do I want to talk about this book? I'm not totally sure. Kit mentioned to me while I was reading that it's like listening to an uncle who goes on wild trips telling you about them, and I have to agree there. The problem is -- it's so not a style I enjoy. Something about it irritates me -- and it was a similar feeling to reading a historical narrative -- I don't like the blurring of facts, the way that everything gets turned into an anecdote. Anyways, the book was... fine. I was interested in the subject, but kept getting lost on what, exactly, Quammen's point was. I think if I just had liked the style more, I would have been on board. So, basically, take my review as a very much a ""personal taste"" problem, and not a problem with the book."
66,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3158636-allie,4,"This book was intensely researched, and it must have taken an insane amount of hours to fact check. However much it wore me out, I really enjoyed learning about the history and contemporary life of predators from around the world. The question about whether they will exist in another eight generations is an interesting one, especially after David Quammen's careful analysis of their importance to the rest of the ecosystem. There was so much in this book that I didn't know about, like the huge cave paintings in the Ardeche and the way a komodo dragon scoops off your flesh when attacking. I'll also never look at the white tigers in the zoo the same way."
67,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9360174-nicole,3,"I think because I had read his other book, Song of the Doudou, I had thought there would be more facts I guess and information on the actual predators themselves. Instead I learned about the fascinating impact that alpha predators had and still do on us. With this impact Quammen concludes that we need these predators, as terrifying as they are, in order for our ecosystems and planet to survive. It's unfortunate though that there are so many problems in the way of creating plans that can be implemented to save these precious keystone species. A good read with great information but not something I'll re read again. "
68,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7974251-loraine,5,"Quammen ranges the globe, telling the stories of apex predators and their (unfortunate) interactions with the human species. His narrative style pulls the reader in almost effortlessly, as one learns about first the Nile crocodile and then the salt water crocodile, on to the Asiatic lion and then the Romanian brown bear, and finally the Amur tiger. He reports from that shared space on the margins, where the predators, both four- and two-legged--engage with one another.Ultimately, the human species is the monster of god. We have forgotten that we are an animal that lives in an ecosystem; as a result, we are eating up the planet."
69,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"16th book for 2016. In this book Quammen explores human interactions with four of the World's great man-eating predators (tigers, lions, crocodiles, bears). At first I was a bit put off by the large amount of space devoted to the human side of the story (this is really much more about people's interactions with animals, rather than animals interactions with people) but was won over by both the quality of the writing, and shear interesting diversity of the ways in which people interact with these creatures (worship, fear, loathing, trophy, pest). This book is a beautiful mediation on the many ways in which how humans relate to the natural world. Well worth reading."
70,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251555-shinynickel,4,"Quammen is a fantastic essayist, and instead of making sweeping generalizations he meditates thoroughly on the problem of large predators in today's world, and their likely coming extinctions. He focuses on issues of conservation, but also on the problems that conserving large predators bring - those who wish to save them are often not those who live near them. It is the poor that often suffer from a local colony of tigers, or alligators, or bears, who lose loved ones or live in fear. Quammen has no pat answers, but he examines the problem clear-eyed and without bias. "
71,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/339555-lisa,4,"I lied. I didn't actually read it. I got about 2 chapters in and decided it was too boring to finish. Not because the material is boring; just because I've read so much natural history already. I was in the mood for something else. Maybe I'll go back to it later. EDIT: I picked it up again and now am enjoying it. Slowly creeping through. I'm determined to finish this thing, no matter how many other books I read before that happens. EDIT 2: The part about the ""monsters"" in the Gilgamesh and Beowulf stories was positively riveting. I couldn't put it down!EDIT 3: I finally finished! "
72,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1245175-deb,5,"Quammen presents an interesting perspective on the complicated nature of large carnivore conservation. He examines perspectives about cohabitation, protection, financial exploitation and eradication of crocodiles, panthers, grizzly bears, Asiatic lions, and Siberian tigers with brief asides to Komodo dragons, great white sharks, etc. After reading his book, my perspective on man's cohabitation with these animals has been broadened. I never thought I would look so fondly on the concept of financial exploitation. "
73,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185993-jen,3,"I enjoyed this book for the author's writing style and his travel stories. However, the subject matter had more to do with man's treatment of predators than the lives of those predators. I would have preferred to learn more about the animals themselves than about whether native populations hate them or admire them, which I think comes down to personal preference more than any deep sociological meaning.A relatively quick read despite its length, thanks to wonderfully engaging writing. I might seek out other books by Quammen."
74,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70739-sarah,5,This book provides a detailed and interesting look into the struggles that occur between impoverished peoples living amongst or near large predators that are often the focus of large scale international conservation efforts. These people are unable to monetarily benefit from the conservation of these creatures and further may lose the ability to farm certain tracts of land or may lose domesticated animals to predation. This is the overlooked consequence of conservation in developing nations when the human impacts are ignored. Excellent read and interesting scientifically.
75,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1212291-emily-aylward,4,"This book took me a while to get through, but it was worth the effort. I thought Quammen's insights on the treatment of animals as they related to treatment of people of the same area were very interesting. I also appreciated his explanations of the various ecological impact of apex predators, as well as the economic impact of the same animals.I really thought this book made a lot of interesting correlations between ecology, economy, and politics. "
76,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68340-elizabeth,5,"This was actually my second time through Monster of God, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Quammen interweaves the stories of four large predators with the stories of the people around them - and speculations as to why we're so afraid of man-eating beasts. While there are parts that lean towards the lurid - for the most part this is a serious treatment of a really interesting topic. The book is long, but well worth it."
77,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/435006-erik-wirfs-brock,3,"A decent enough book, I would give it about 3.5 stars if I could. This author is obviously a good author, but I think the book suffers from trying to be two things and being okay at both, instead of being excellent one subject. So you get somewhat interesting tales of hanging out in communities that live near large predators, and scattershot liteary/historical analysis of how predators figured into imgaination of people in the past."
78,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3244769-stellajames,5,"Excellent read, filled with biology, natural history and the crazy history of men—dictators, hunters, pompous officials—and other predators, the Lions of Gir, man- and woman-eating crocs, tigers, bears and more. History, the future—Quammen touches all of it with his humor and dire seriousness. The last chapter is for sure the icing on this big cake of a book. Loved it, even though it is so, so very sad."
79,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4741274-kristy,3,"This book dragged a bit for me but in the end I was glad I worked thought it.It's about man carnivore interaction in several different parts of the world. How the people handle bear, lions, tigers, and alligators existing in their backyards. How the animals have been affected by the proximity of man. It was more about ecology than psychology.

He'll teach you and make you think deeply about the subject without lecturing to you. "

96,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147759-britt,4,this book is fantastic. maybe not quite as good as song of the dodo because it relies on 5 separate research trips. but I think Quammen is the best natural history writer out there. His writing is engaging while still scientifically accurate.
97,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377317-leonard-pierce,5,"Quammen's fascinating book deals with the history, science and cultural meaning of man-eating animals. Most of them will likely be gone -- completely extinct -- within 100 years, making this a terribly sad book as well as a brilliant one."
98,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1185730-dave,4,"Lions, tigers and bears oh my! A great read! Everything you've always wanted to know about apex preadators. Why we have them, why we need them, what do they mean to humans, and why there aren't bigger, meaner ones in the world today. The biologist in me enjoyed this book."
99,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4114373-sharon-zink,3,"I'm glad I read it. The book was about large preditors that could be a threat to man. It covers the history of the species, cultural anthropology of the people who live in close contact with each animal, and ways to protect the species."
100,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7639256-lusine,5,"Very enjoyable read. Though nothing really earth-shaking in terms of new theories on human-animal relationship, this book is definitely an interesting and entertaining, as well as well-balanced in its opinions. "
101,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586691-anne,4,"It took me a while to read this book, but that's due to my schedule. It's not my first book by mr Quammen and I must say I like his style. You always learn a lot about animals, people, ecology, nature and such."
102,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897630-christina,4,"So much to learn in the world! This travel/ecology nonfic was right up my alley. The writing is smart and never condescending, the research extensive, and the subject (conservation of large predators in the wild) both fascinating and important."
103,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5975497-rachel-kappler,2,"After the first part about lions, which I absolutely love, I had a hard time getting into the book. was kinda like I was forcing myself to read it. not sure what it is about the book. The detail is great, sometimes too much. The topics in it are things I would rather watch a documentary on."
104,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8688008-nate,3,"Not the best written book of this kind I've read, but entertaining, easy to follow, and very informative. I've been spoiled by John Vaillant, but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone curious about natural history, evolution, or just plain interested in lions, tigers, or bears"
105,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3701492-ejr,5,"I found this book extremely fascinating and I just love Quammen's style of writing about nonfiction. If you like big predators this is the book for you. He discusses Tiger, Lions, Alligators, and other man eating beasts and how they live with humans. It was a great read."
106,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936861-megs,3,"This is the third book by David Quammen that I have read. I loved the other two so much that this one was a little bit of a let down. It was more storytelling than ecological insight, and altogether still an interesting book, but less than I had expected from one of my favorite authors. "
107,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7300782-chris,3,"Superb, literary writing, an expansive, cross-disciplinary narrative, and an enchanting travelogue. That said, the book couldn't hold my attention for long periods of time - probably says more about me than the book."
108,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19101731-jessie,4,"This book was a little dry, compared to Quammen's other books. He didn't infuse much humor, but it was still a great read with a lot of interesting info about how large predators and humans affect each other. "
109,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2399138-doug,3,"AS much about the mythology of big beasts as their biology and ecology...and why their populations are in trouble, generally. Good book, bit of a slog to get through. Quammen is a very talented writer."
110,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68710-jack-o-bang,4,If I ran the discovery channel all the programming would resemble this book.
111,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288451-sarah,0,"Hmm, I love David Quammen and this has been sitting way too long on my bookshelf. I need to pick it back up. "
112,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/378568-ken,4,"The narrow focus put me off a bit at first, but Quammen's writing style is engaging enough to keep me interested. As the book goes on, the scope widens and gets more interesting."
113,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731356-jason,4,"Not as magnetic as ""Song of the Dodo,"" but still really excellent in its animal passages--the researcher who wakes up with a lion cub in his sleeping bag is representative."
114,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1053206-ryan,4,"Part travelogue, part beginner's guide to zoology. This one gets off-track in the middle but its fascinating on the whole."
115,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/955250-jessie,3,It was interesting enough of a book. I did have a hard time following it at times. 
116,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216818-paul-schuette,4,Great overview of man's connections to predators around the world. 
117,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2175652-shelly,0,Educational and informative book about the deadliest predators that live on earth today. A smart read with big words that make you grab your dictionary at times--love that about a book!
118,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279095-erika-harada,3,"A bit tedious, but still interesting."
119,1844133230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940709-cara,3,I'm glad I don't have to worry about being eaten by tigers.
