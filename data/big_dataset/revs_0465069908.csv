If you're offended by the fact that I think creationism is utter bullshit, I'm sorry - but Richard Dawkins isn't, and he's more than happy to give a hundred reasons why you're a moron for believing it. On top of giving ammo to those of us who do come in contact with the less scientifically enlightened among us (snobbery, anyone?), he manages to put a lot of things into very good perspective. While this book is about DNA and life, it's also about the fact that there's a HUGE difference between the life of the individual and the life of the species, and just how important it is that we understand this as we come to control our own genome.Seriously, don't judge this book by its size (or its stupid-ass, kissing fish cover): It's heavy but quick, and will do your brain good."
1,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"There is a point in River Out of Eden when the stark brutality of nature really hits home. With a nervous system programmed to kill anything that moves near its young unless it emits a babies cry, a deaf mother turkey mistakes her children for predators and, in a bid to protect them, ends up massacring every last one. It's one of several tragic anecdotes used to make an important point, and the kind of jolt that Dawkins does best. This is not however a pessimistic book. Far from it. As Dawkins reminds us, nature is neither cruel nor kind, only ""pitilessly indifferent"" - but when you understand how it works, its genius is positively awe-inspiring. If you have already read several other Dawkins' titles - The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, etc - then you may find this adds little to what you already know. However if you're not too familiar with evolution but keen to delve into Dawkins' scientific titles - perhaps you've only previously read the God Delusion - then I recommend going for this one. Not too long and not too lumbered with detail, it takes the reader through genes, DNA and natural selection - via African Eve and blindfolded bees - in a beautifully-written account peppered with anecdotes and various mind-boggling facts and figures that will explain just enough to inspire you to read more."

There's nothing special here that can't be found in Dawkins' other book. If you still didn't read The Blind Watchmaker, or better still The Ancestor's Tale, I would suggest you opt for them as the topics he is talking about in this book are better treated in in the others and in the case of The Ancestor's Tale, they are more up to date."
3,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3098873-simon-maginn,5,"Magisterial. In person, Richard Dawkins can seem defensive, arrogant: chippy. Hardly surprising, considering that he is a dignified and serious scientist who has had to spend years combating preposterous and impudent attacks. But his books are meticulous, supple and surprisingly sensual. His love of, and fascination with, the mechanics of the natural world is exhilarating and a joy to read. Complexities melt away, leaving a view of the world which is infinitely more beautiful, mysterious and astonishing than that propounded by any of his innumerable detractors. I defy any rational person to read his fiercely funny analysis of Intelligent Design and its fallacies (deaf turkeys who dilligently slay their own young because they cannot hear the sound that makes them recognise the chicks as their own, for instance) and not be convinced: they must simply not want to know. As Winston Churchill once said to a persistent questioner: 'Madam, I have given you an explanation: I cannot, alas, give you an understanding.'If Dawkins did not exist, we would have to invent him."

A good place to start, but maybe one to skip over if you've read The Selfish Gene or The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design. "
5,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,4,"This is simply a beautiful book. It's kind of hard to put into words why this book is worth reading, or even really what it's about, but I'll try.Richard Dawkins was catapulted into popular stardom by his views on religion, not his views on science. But what the average person (who now knows his name) doesn't know is that Dawkins was a well-respected evolutionary biologist long before he released ""The God Delusion"". The vast majority of his books are written within his primary field of expertise, and The God Delusion is the exception to this, despite it being the book for which he is now most famous among the population.I imagine it must be frustrating for Dawkins that whenever he appears on a news show, the caption under his name says something like ""militant atheist"" rather than ""evolutionary biologist"" or even ""scientist"". Sam Harris and, to an extent, Christopher Hitchens, are at war with religion: belief in God is their primary target. Though Dawkins is often lumped with them, I don't get the impression that Dawkins is really the same kind of atheist as Harris or Hitchens.Richard Dawkins is an expert on evolution and biology. In his writing, he makes it clear that he has an outstanding appreciation for nature, an appreciation that is informed by his understanding of evolution. To Dawkins, the world is full of majesty and wonder, beauty and grace, and it is so not IN SPITE of the fact that it formed gradually over billions of years, but BECAUSE of it. For Dawkins, the Darwinian view of life is what makes the world so fascinating and awesome. This makes Dawkins passionate about evolution, to the point where he wants to share his appreciation for nature with others. The problem is, whenever he has done so, he was met with frothing morons who talk about evolution being ""just a theory"" without knowing what they were talking about. Further investigation into this perplexing resistance to facts revealed they were all motivated by religion, which caused Dawkins to realize that one of the major problems with our society was that it was largely under a collective delusion that prevented them from having the same appreciation for the world that Dawkins wished to impress upon them, hence: The God Delusion. For Dawkins, religious belief isn't something to argue against on its own, but it is particularly heinous because it takes a thing of elegant beauty (that from a simple set of basic rules and a huge amount of time, a great deal of complexity could develop on its own) and cheapens it by explaining all as the mere act of an all powerful bearded man in the sky.I see Dawkins as a teacher who considers the entire population his classroom. He wants to share with his students, but has found them resistant for a silly reason. Undaunted, Dawkins has simply taken it upon himself to remove this roadblock before continuing on his lesson. If he wants everyone to understand and appreciate how amazing evolutionary biology is, he must first get them to release their grips on this ancient superstitions that prevent them from accepting it. Once that's done, he can get back to work.Dawkins's recent books, The God Delusion and The Greatest Show on Earth, are addressed to these students. The ones who cannot let go of their ancient myths, and the ones who refuse to understand the basic facts of evolution. The God Delusion is meant to weaken the grip, and The Greatest Show on Earth is meant to explain the very basic tenets of evolution as well as dispel some of the most common misconceptions and weak arguments against it.His earlier books, however, were written for a different kind of audience. This audience already accepts the facts of evolution. This audience already has an appreciation for the world as seen through the lens of Darwin. And River Out of Even is exactly this kind of book.If you don't accept or don't like evolution, River Out of Eden will not convince you that you are incorrect. The book you want to read is The Greatest Show on Earth. If you insist that all of this complexity surrounds us because sky-daddy deemed it so, pick up a copy of The God Delusion.But if you accept evolution, River Out of Even will take you on a fascinating journey. Dawkins uses Darwinian evolution as a lens to look at a wide variety of different aspects of life on this planet, leading the reader down dozens of unique ""wow, I never thought about it like that"" moments. The implications of evolution often included things I never realized, and I had more ""holy crap, that's awesome!"" occurrences during this book than anything I've read recently. Dawkins takes the reader on this journey with extraordinarily well-written prose, weaving concepts together seamlessly. The book never gets particularly technical, but it never reduces itself to pandering to the ignorant either. This is a book for smart people who think science is interesting. If you've ever read about or seen an experiment that resulted in a feeling of heart-pounding excitement at its implications, you may well enjoy this book a great deal."

It flows like a river through us (and all creatures) and we are merely the banks (of the river) that house the DNA for its continuation into next generation, and the next (or not).I have read many of Dawkins' books and articles and this is a winner! If you're interested in learning exactly what Dawkins means by ""The Selfish Gene"" or the DNA river - this is the read & it's a quicky! The concepts are not as difficult in this book as many others - rather - it's a layman's explanation of our beginnings from the replacation bombs in space to the biological zygote (or previous bacteria) and on to our own technological replacation bombs. Now, I get why he was lead to the next step: memes.A fun read about the river of DNA that flows in all of us! And, it was particularly interesting to learn about Mitochondrial eve and the importance of the female line as it is always a pure line (no mixing of DNA there!), so it's much easier to study."

It's a good essay, but, first, we find better introductory books on the subject, and, then, The Selfish Gene, more detailed, is far better to discover Dawkins' ideas."

9,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881934-elisa-clawson,1,"I got this book for an english class. Richard Dawkins really bugs me. His view is that people who are religious are uneducated and delusional - hence his newest book ""The God Delusion""."
10,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98984485-ulyana-kubini,4,"This was a great book to introduce me to the wonders of evolutionary biology. Richard Dawkins is one of the most intelligent writers in this topic and will easily describe and outline the best arguments for evolution in this book. Plus, he is able to give an amazing description of the natural processes that occur everyday, and do so with great examples which are relatively easy to understand. I didn't quite grasp everything, but I got Richard's point. He has written other great books on similar topics, and they are more detailed. This book wasn't meant for people who already know the nitty gritty details of evolution. It's centered at those who have a fast paced life and are interested in learning the truth about the process of natural selection. If you are a creationist, than you'll definitely be triggered by Dawkins. And for a good reason: he completely destroys your world view every day that he is able to communicate with the public, which includes him writing books to inform this society about the dangers of illogical thinking and how you can very easily start to understand a difficult to grasp topic by simple reading 170 pages. This book will spark a passion for science in many creationists (and people who aren't decided on what to believe). Along with this book, I recommend reading Mr. Dawkins' other highly interesting books on evolution, as they will cover more an this book did."
11,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"I thought this book elegant. The writing is elegant. Dawkins's use of analogy and example to explain the complexities of evolution is elegant. He glides from idea to idea as elegantly as dance. I only wish I had more background. Dawkins' writing here isn't overbearingly technical. Still, not being a strong swimmer in science, I found myself at times over my head in deep pools of DNA and replicator genes and had to flail a bit before finding a toehold on some sandbar of familiar detail. That's not the author's fault but my own muddy understanding. To me his writing seemed clear, concise--impressively so--and even tinged with humor. Mostly it's smooth and effortless. Mostly Dawkins and I were good companions, Huck and Jim. I'm glad I made the journey."
12,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"A wonderfully exciting read. There were bits of it (like the last chapter)that were way over my head, but a lot of it was absolutely fascinating. Dawkins writes enchantingly. My understanding of DNA has changed...and I loved all the wonderful examples and illustrations that he brings to his arguments. I'm grossly ignorant, yet even I managed to get tons from this book. Now I need to read it again."
13,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855270-bere-tarar,3,An amazing efford to explain a very complexe topic 
14,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43782327-christopher-rytting,3,"""I very well could expect too much from 160 pages..."" I worry, as I give this slender book, which I hear is supposed to explain evolution, a cursory front to back scan.""But these aren't just any 160 pages!"" And I dive in.Indeed, evolution is a big and exciting topic. The preface's claim with respect to Darwinian selection, that ""never were so many facts explained by so few assumptions"", holds true for me. Point to nearly any phenomenon of life -- and by life I don't mean reality, but rather living things -- and you can probably furnish a reasonable explanation as to how this trait facilitates, or at least doesn't impede, survival of its possessor (survival for long enough that said possessor and its ancestors can procreate at least once). Evolution is an incredibly simple idea for all the complexity in the living world it can explain. For many a compelling stretch of read in this book, Dawkins flourishes in this challenge. It might be hard to imagine natural selection doing something as difficult as modeling an orchid's smell and shape after a female bee so that male bees cross-pollinate for the flower. It might seem improbable that the intricate and involved dance that bees perform to guide fellow bees to food sources developed by gradual degrees through evolution. But we're led through sensible and gradual progressions towards these improbable outcomes in a clear and compelling way.This elegant perch on Occam's razor has helped evolution enchant me for years and scholars for centuries. It is extraordinarily popular to explain human behavior through evolution, but I worry it might be a little too easy to do so. It's not hard to imagine that we understand how things were when our ancestors evolved to eventually become us. For example, this confidence might lead us to claim that the reason we have a fight-or-flight response is because the animals that didn't have it were killed by lions on the savanna. This sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation. However, just because something sounds reasonable doesn't mean it's true. We just as likely could have developed a fight-or-flight response because for those who didn't have it, life was boring enough that they didn't attract mates and thus never had children, or maybe they just killed themselves because life was so dull. Then it would be lack of drama, as opposed to predators, that killed off those who lacked this response. We must be wary of explanations that could have been masquerading as things that were. In line with this, because it's easy to see reasons for everything through the lens of Darwinian selection, we can be uninclined to wonder what else was going on as the first forms of life evolved into us. It is no mean feat to tackle evolution in 160 pages, let alone the other arguments of the book. Even if this were a more concerted effort at explaining natural selection, I doubt Dawkins could answer my questions about how DNA came about (the earliest forms of life likely didn't have it), how cells initially came to divide themselves, or how any of the machinery that enables natural selection and complex life came about in the first place. These are huge questions, it seems to me, if you want to explain that everything we experience is naught but the machinations of genes in chemical competition for survival. But when you also aim to convert the reader wholly to reasoning based on physical evidence and to rejecting any other kind of reasoning, perhaps you've bitten off more than you can chew.Maybe Dawkins's aim is naught but to pique our interest, spurring us on to answer the myriad questions that arise in response to this book. That being the case means a pass with flying colors. But if he hopes that his reader now understands the sole mechanism responsible for variance in organism, I am left wanting."
15,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20275457-alan-williamson,5,"Through the deceptively simple metaphor of a river of genetic information, coursing through time, Dawkins guides us on an incisive explanation of life. It's far more inspiring and intellectually satisfying than any mythological Eden.Some Dawkins books can be a challenging read but, aside from a somewhat dull section on sex ratios (studied them in university and never found the subject interesting) this is a book that wastes no time. Short and insightful."

23,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39649624-patrick,4,"Another great Dawkins book on evolution, that “life is a river of genes flowing through geological time where organisms are mere temporary bodies.” It explains quite clearly how evolution works and how any difference amongst organisms is simply due to evolution over different places and time. It is very intriguing to think about how different organisms have evolved and have ended up so radically different from one another. Enlightening read and recommended.“Yet the genetic code is in fact literally identical in all animals, plants and bacteria that have ever been looked at. All earthly living things are certainly descended from a single ancestor.”Some of my highlights from the book:- It is tempting to think that when ancestors did successful things, the genes they passed on to their children were, as a result, upgraded relative to the genes they had received from their parents. Something about their success rubbed off on their genes, and that is why their descendants are so good at flying, swimming, courting. Wrong, utterly wrong! Genes do not improve in the using, they are just passed on, unchanged except for very rare random errors. It is not success that makes good genes.- There are now perhaps thirty million branches to the river of DNA, for that is an estimate of the number of species on earth. It has also been estimated that the surviving species constitute about 1 percent of the species that have ever lived. It would follow that there have been some three billion branches to the river of DNA- …find that, one by one, they join up with other rivers. The river of human genes joins with the river of chimpanzee genes at about the same time as the river of gorilla genes does, some seven million years- The study of molecular biology has, in any case, shown the great animal groups to be much closer to one another than we used to think. You can treat the genetic code as a dictionary in which sixty-four words in one language (the sixty-four possible triplets of a four-letter alphabet) are mapped onto twenty-one words in another language (twenty amino acids plus a punctuation mark). The odds of arriving at the same 64:21 mapping twice by chance are less than one in a million million million million million. Yet the genetic code is in fact literally identical in all animals, plants and bacteria that have ever been looked at. All earthly living things are certainly descended from a single ancestor. Nobody would dispute that, but some startlingly close resemblances between, for instance, insects and vertebrates are now showing tip when people examine not just the code itself…- Genes are pure information-information that can be encoded, recoded and decoded, without any degradation or change of meaning. Pure information can be copied and, since it is digital information, the fidelity of the copying can be immense. DNA characters are copied with an accuracy that rivals anything modern engineers can do. They are copied down the generations, with just enough occasional errors to introduce variety.- An enzyme is a very large molecule whose threedimensional shape speeds up one particular kind of chemical reaction by providing a surface that encourages that reaction. Since what matters about biological molecules- …the most dramatic of these is one of the earliest: the process known as gastrulation. The distinguished embryologist Lewis Wolpert has gone so far as to say. ""It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life."" What happens at gastrulation is that a hollow ball of cells buckles to form a cup with an inner lining. Essentially all embryologies throughout the animal kingdom undergo this same process of gastrulation. It is the uniform foundation on which the diversity of embryologies rests. Here I mention gastrulation as just one example-a particularly dramatic one-of the kind of restless, origami-like movement of whole sheets of cells that is often seen in embryonic development.- But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not.- We get our mitochondria from our mother only. Sperms are too small to contain more than a few mitochondria; they have just enough to provide the energy to power their tails as they swim toward the egg, and these mitochondria are cast away with the tail when the sperm head is absorbed in the egg at fertilization. The egg is massive by comparison, and its huge, fluid-filled interior contains a rich culture of mitochondria. This culture seeds the child's body. So whether you are female or male, your mitochondria are all descended from an initial inoculum of your mother's mitochondria.- Human males are roused to lust by pictures in a magazine. A picture is just printing ink on paper. It is two-dimensional, not three. The image is only a few inches high. It may be a crude caricature consisting of a few lines, rather than a lifelike representation. Yet it can still arouse a man to erection. Perhaps a fleeting view of a female is all a fast-flying wasp can expect to get before attempting to copulate with her. Perhaps male wasps notice only a few key stimuli anyway. There is every reason to think that wasps might be even easier to fool than humans.- Before Darwin, even educated people who had abandoned ""Why"" questions for rocks, streams and eclipses still implicitly accepted the legitimacy of the ""Why"" question where living creatures were concerned. Now only the scientifically illiterate do. But ""only"" conceals the unpalatable truth that we are still talking about an absolute majority.- Fifty-fifty is said to be the evolutionarily stable sex ratio because natural selection does not favor any tendency to deviate from it, and if there is any deviation from it natural selection favors a tendency to redress the balance.- Genes don't care about suffering, because they don't care about anything.- If Nature were kind, she would at least make the minor concession of anesthetizing caterpillars before they are eaten alive from within. But Nature is neither kind nor unkind. She is neither against suffering nor for it. Nature is not interested one way or the other in suffering, unless it affects the survival of DNA.- The natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease. It must be so. If there is ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. - A more elaborate and mysterious consequence of crossing the neuron threshold is conscious awareness, and I shall call Threshold 6 the Consciousness Threshold. We don't know how often this has been achieved on our planet. Some philosophers believe that it is crucially bound up with language, which seems to have been achieved once only, by the bipedal ape species Honio sapiens. Whether or not consciousness requires language, let us anyway recognize the Language Threshold as a major one, Threshold 7. which may or may not he crossed on a planet. The details of language, such as whether it is transmitted by sound or some other physical medium, must be relegated to local significance."
24,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31053403-gage,5,"I like how the author goes on tangents and tells the reader about interesting animal behaviors. Some of the topics are comical, like tricking bees to fly into rocks. The topics discussed were very interesting-it may have been the presentation-but the thoughts at the beginning were so novel that I really wanted to hear more. Some of the things it said have inspired me to look at some normally mundane things in a new perspective. When I finished the book, I was anxious for more.River Out Of Eden is about life. It puts some things in perspective while educating the reader. There are so many perspectives offered in this book, the author explains the work of many others. It gets the reader interested in biology. It explains content in an easy to understand way while connecting it to real life. The book wasn't based on any topic more central than biology. Although there was a large amount of content about biological communities and their interactions.The author's presentation of the content shows his talent, as far as literature is concerned. The sheer amount of content demonstrates his massive knowledge on the subject. The combination of those two traits alone allows for this book to be written as well as it was. The book is written in a way in which it makes the reader feel almost as though he/she's just having a conversation with the author.I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has the slightest interest in science of any kind. This book has no vulgarity so the only age recommendation is just to be old enough to comprehend it. The text is mostly informal, so there's also no gender recommendation. I would not recommend this book to people who would consider themselves, ""anti-science."" Overall, most would enjoy this book and learn something in the progress."
25,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"You can easily read this book in one afternoon, which is both its strength and its weakness. Dawkins manages to cram the whole essence of evolution by natural selection in less than 200 pages. And not only this, he also brings his unique style of educating the audience to bear on this project. Nevertheless, there's nothing in this book that Dawkins (never mind other authors) hasn't explained in a more comprehensive and more complete way elsewhere. If you want to learn about the gene-centered view of life, read The Selfish Gene (1978); if you want to know more about the implications of phenotypes in gene-survival, read The Extended Phenotype (1982); if you want to know more about the mechanism of the gradual construction of improbable complexity, read The Blind Watchmaker (1986). Even as a compact guide to the full scope of biology (embryology, evolution, etc.) Dawkins himself has written better books: Climbing Mount Improbable (1996) and The Greatest Show on Earth (2010).I think this book is only useful for an audience which doesn't have a lot of prior knowledge about evolution. Maybe (just maybe) it's also a entertaining summary for those of us who have read Dawkins' other works. But nothing more than this. On a sidenote: I don't like the fact that Dawkins used up the minimum amount of space available for feeding us speculations on the origin and progression of 'life' in our universe. Considering the audience he aims at, this gives a poor vision on this subject (apart from offering creationists the 'he-too argument' of saying ""look, he's accusing us of speculating, but he's speculating himself!"")."
26,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2269105-michael-p,4,"I really have only three minor problems with this book. I am not impressed by Dawkins as a writer. His extended metaphor of the river down which all life flows, from the first single cell creatures to our eventual descendants, is actually quite an effective way of explaining the ins and outs of evolution, but it goes on and on and on, much like the river itself. Boredom sets in.Though many do not find it so, Dawkins’s style is dull to me. It is too much of a chore to read his book. I am not persuaded that whatever is true of our bodies exists solely to replicate our DNA in our offspring. Dawkins has persuaded me that this is the overwhelming trend and he admits that in the past there are been evolutionary dead ends that ended with the deaths of people with ineffective genes/traits, but if there could be ineffective genes then, there can be ineffective genes now. Also, I honestly do not see how some behaviors, masturbation, for example, lead to offspring. Indeed, quite the opposite. I do wish that Dawkins could make this adjustment in his approach, or if he agrees with these statements, that he would make it obvious in his books.Overall, however, this book does quite a good job explaining the origins and nature of life on earth, from the most sophisticated mammals and birds to the simplest fungus. Chapters 3 and 4 put what out to be, but won’t be, the final nails in the coffin of Intelligent Design."
27,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11222167-sebouh,4,"A Digital DNA river runs into the future. It has extremely high (but not perfect) replication fidelity, and may bifurcate, giving rise to new species. Evolution and biology is (again) beautifully explained by Dawkins. Some of the points I found interesting in the book: 1.	Living organisms evoke a strong illusion of design, which makes sense at first glance. But science (often counter-intuitive) shows otherwise. The key to understand that is to imagine gradual change over long span of time , and you have evolution by natural selection ( Non random selection of random mutations).2.	We have a natural tendency to evaluate all natural phenomenons from a human point of view, like searching a purpose or an ultimate utility in everything. This may mislead us to wrong conclusions.3.

A little episodic, and a little short. Five (mostly independent) chapters at around 35 pages each. Two were not that interesting to me. I did like the one trying to respond to the argument that evolution is impossible because half an eye is not at all useful. (He focused on that as well as a letter he received about how an orchid is shaped just so that a male wasp will try to screw it---right down to making the wasp pheremones!) Also interesting was the one about how the number of males and females of most species are about equally dispersed, even though sometimes a small percentage of the males have a large percentage of the offspring---so why would a species waste energy on all those bachelors who aren't going to have kids?

Excellent overview for Darwinian evolution...simple, logical explanations that should serve most receptive readers, and really dispels the ""not possible for an intermediate stage"" arguments. There are nice turns of phrase throughout (I especially liked ""embryological origami""). And he points out an outstanding counter to the ""you can't answer 'why' questions"": The mere fact that it is possible to frame a question does not make it legitimate or sensible to do so.[...]...but at the very least, you have no right to assume that the ""Why?"" question deserves an answer when posed about a boulder, a misfortune, Mt. Everest or the universe.""Well worth the read, and likely a re-read."

This book was remarkably easier to follow than his first book and shows much more of his personality, enthusiasm and passion for biology. He seems to pick out fewer examples to communicate each point than in ""The Selfish Gene"" but they seem to be those carefully selected because they are the points which can be more thoroughly developed for the purpose of instruction. From honeybee dances to mitochondrial genetic lineage to yet another crushing defeat of the creationist's ""complexity of the eyeball"" argument, he teaches evolutionary biology (particularly in this book of a genetic focus) in a way that is easy to follow and retain."

38,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18681755-constantino-casasbuenas,5,"Dawkins, RichardRiver Out of EdenPhoenix Paperback, 1999Since the moment that we started to travel to Oxford (1999), I started to hear about the books written by Richard Dawkins. A few years later both, Juan David and Constanza read some of his books (The Selfish Gene) and I got interested but didn’t read any of his books. In December 2017 Dawkins visited Bogotá, Medellín, and Cartagena and had an exciting dialogue with Gerardo Remolina, from the Jesuits. Though I wanted to attend, I didn’t because it was too expensive.Anyway, I was interested because of his Darwinian position about our origin, and his clear negation about the existence of God, Heaven and Hell, the Angels, and the stories that people after people since ancient history have told us, in order to defend our transcendence and our projection, heaven and hell, into the future after we will be dead. In a very simple language, he connects the reader with the micro and macro dimensions of our world to explain a few fundamental ideas.           His statement was clear: the key purpose of life is transmitting DNA. It flows through time and not geography. It’s a river of information. In the River Out of Eden, he explains some of the key arguments.In chapter 1 Dawkins explains why DNA is a digital river. After a precious comparison between analog (older) and digital (newer? engineering) systems, he concludes that humans share both. “The world becomes full of organisms that have what it takes to become ancestors”.2 Genes are not improved. They are just passed on. “There are now perhaps thirty million branches to the river of DNA, for that it is an estimate of the number of species on earth”. 9 “All earthly living things are certainly descended from a single ancestor”. 14 “apart from the differences in jargon, the pages of a molecular-biology journal might be interchanged with those of a computer-engineering journal”. 20 “Life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information”. 22In chapter 2, the author goes into the many beliefs, tribes, religions, etc…. and all of them are true for their believers. This is relative. Science, math, etc., are supported by evidence, while myths and faiths ”are not and do not”. 37 “It is molecular biology that has given us the charismatic African Eve. 44 “African Eve is sometimes called Mitochondrial Eve”. 51 “We get our mitochondria from our mother only”. Our conclusions are: (1) There is one Mitochondrial Eve (most recent common ancestor of all modern human s down the female path). (2) There existed one person (unknown sex) who is the most recent common ancestor - Focal Ancestor - down any pathway; (3) It is vanishingly unlikely that both are the same; (4) It is more likely that the Focal Ancestor was a male; (5) Mitochondrial Eve lived less than a quarter of millions of years ago; (6) Informed opinion still favours Africa. “The river of DNA has been flowing through our ancestors in an unbroken line that spans not less than three thousand million years”. 66Chapter 3 is dedicated to the evolution of specific animals. Though the many cases are pretty impressive, I loved how he describes bees, and the patterns that they follow in order to indicate the existence of food in one specific direction and how they represent in a dance, the distance where the food is.Chapter 4 is dedicated to a utility function. “The true process that has endowed wings and eyes, beaks, nesting instincts and everything else about life with the full illusion of purposeful design is now well understood.”114 “Utilitarians strive to maximize <>”.121 “What was God’s utility function?”. 122 “…everything makes sense once you assume that DNA survival is what is being maximized”. 124 “Genes don’t care about suffering because they don’t care about anything”. 153The last chapter is dedicated to the Replication Bomb when the author goes into heredity. He describes 10 Thresholds:1. Replicator Threshold – self-copying system. Variants compete for resources.2. After many generations of evolution, we move into Threshold 2, the Phenotype Threshold (causal effects on something else.3. The replicator team threshold, because the genes work in teams.4. Many-cells threshold5. High-speed information processing6. Consciousness threshold (related to language?).7. Language threshold is a MAJOR THRESHOLD.8. Cooperative technology threshold9. Radio threshold10. Space travel thresholdIt seems important his recommendation to read Carl Sagan's Cosmos.  American astronomer. The book ends “on some beneficial effects upon our normally parochial little consciousness; some echo of the poetic impact of Newton’s statue in Trinity College, Cambridge, upon the admittedly giant consciousness of William Wordsworth:And from my pillow, looking forth by lightOf moon on favouring stars, I could beholdThe antechapel where the statue stoodOf Newton with his prism and silent face,The marble index of a mind for everVoyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone. 188"
39,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74410128-wei-jun,3,"I enjoyed reading this book despite placing much effort on keeping up with Richard Dawkins English ""elegance"". Thankfully he presents his arguments with elaborate analogies. He has solidified my understanding of Darwinian evolution. Remarked to my girlfriend of similar race and dialect groups, given that we were migrates to our current land (at least our 3rd generation ancestry came from China), chances of us branching out from a single stream was high and barely 200 years ago. And that were probably distant cousins of sorts. Mildly disconcerting, from a Gene-Centered point of view, limiting diversity. But whatever. The most exciting part of the book for me was chapter 3 on the evolution mechanism of complexity in nature and chapter 4. Excerpts on Chapter 3: Relating the human eye and complex behaviours displayed by organisms(i.e Wasp) ""A key feature of evolution is its gradualness[..] It may or may not be the case that some episodes of evolution take a sudden turn. There may be punctuations of rapid evolution, or even abrupt macromutations—major changes dividing a child from both its parents. There certainly are sudden extinctions—perhaps caused by great natural catastrophes such as comets striking the earth—and these leave vacuums to be filled by rapidly improving understudies, as the mammals replaced the dinosaurs[..]Without gradualness in these cases, we are back to miracle, which is simply a synonym for the total absence of explanation.The reason eyes and wasp-pollinated orchids impress us so is that they are improbable. The odds against their spontaneously assembling by luck are odds too great to be borne in the real world. Gradual evolution by small steps, each step being lucky but not too lucky, is the solution to the riddle. But if it is not gradual, it is no solution to the riddle: it is just a restatement of the riddle.”Excerpts on Chapter 4:The indifference of nature to our 'human whims'.""Many genes are switched on in the early embryo, but others—like the gene for Huntington’s chorea, the disease that tragically killed the folk poet and singer Woody Guthrie—are not switched on until middle age. Second, the details of a genetic effect, including the time at which it is switched on, may be modified by other genes. A man possessing the Huntington’s chorea gene can expect to die from the disease, but whether it kills him when he is forty or when he is fifty-five (as Woody Guthrie was) may be influenced by other genes. It follows that by selection of “modifier” genes the time of action of a particular gene can either be postponed or brought forward in evolutionary time.A gene like the Huntington’s chorea gene, which switches on between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-five, has plenty of opportunity to be passed on to the next generation before it kills its possessor. If, however, it were switched on at the age of twenty, it would be passed on only by people who reproduce rather young, and therefore it would be strongly selected against. If it were switched on at the age of ten, it would essentially never be passed on. Natural selection would favor any modifier genes that had the effect of postponing the age of switching on of the Huntington’s chorea gene. According to the Medawar/Williams theory, this would be exactly why it normally does not switch on until middle age. Once upon a time it may well have been an early maturing gene, but natural selection has favored a postponing of its lethal effect until middle age. No doubt there is still slight selection pressure to push it on into old age, but this pressure is weak because so few victims die before reproducing and passing the gene on.""Dam you nature. You are the wisest most cunning person I know. "
40,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4,"Reading Richard Dawkins is an inspirational venture. What makes the experience so rewarding is the clarity of thought and logical propositions that abound in the book. The explanations are so crystal clear that it would bathe the mental landscape in the pristine light of true knowledge. As the most convincing author in the genre of popular science, as well as being the most down-to-earth one, Dawkins has published many books, each of which is a gem in its own right. Many books are reviewed earlier in this blog itself and I am not a person who would waste an opportunity to get hold of one of Dawkins’ books. ‘River out of Eden’ is a great book that exposes the secret of the river of life that flows uninterrupted from the origins to the present moment. Conflicting and confusing responses may be elicited if one were to ask the reason for life existing on earth. Keeping aside philosophical and religious responses, what we learn from the book is that life’s only purpose is to perpetuate the genetic code that made it in the first place. All the infinite variations and subtle nuances exist for only one purpose – to replicate the DNA that is the basis of heredity – and to ensure its continuity in the world in the form of other beings spawned from the parent. This line of argument may seem blasphemous to some, outrageous to some other, but calm pondering of the basic issue of debate vindicates Dawkins’ stand. The book is adorned with an impressive list of books for future reading and sports a good index. Illustrations are done by Lalla Ward, the author’s wife, which blends harmoniously with the content. The river flowing out of Eden is a stream of genes, forking billions of times along the way. When a species begins to separate in some way – geographic separation is the most common cause – a bifurcation is said to have taken place in the course of the river. Animals in the two separated streams can still produce offspring during the initial stages, but they don’t do it actually, because of the physical separation. Dawkins postulates that living bodies are only temporary vehicles in which the self-replicating genes find expression, in their flow through time. In fact, he likens the living organisms to the banks of the river, which helps the current to follow its course and not spilled over to other channels. Indian philosophers may bring to notice an arresting resemblance to the ancient spiritual speculation that the body is only a temporary seat of the soul, which itself is immortal. If the term, ‘soul’ is replaced with genes, Dawkins’ example emerges full blown out of the picture. But nothing like this can be further from the spirit of the book as well as Dawkins’ imaginative thought. Deceptive pitfalls await readers who connect science’s discoveries which are based on proof to idle speculation that masquerades as ancient philosophy. Explaining the concepts of mitochondrial DNA, the author establishes that all the people now alive on the planet descended from a single woman who lived around a quarter of a million years ago, most probably in Africa. This great great grandmother, also called Mitochondrial Eve for obvious reasons, was definitely not the only woman alive at that time. There might have been many males in that generation who have descendants today. But the DNA carried forward through the male line is resident in the nucleus of cells and gets eventually lost through sexual recombination. But mitochondrial DNA is passed only through the mother and is uncontaminated. Taking the frequency of random mutations into account, the period at which the ancestor lived could be estimated. Every one of Dawkins’ books attempts to answer the probing questions posed by creationists to mock at evolution and its mechanisms. One of the commonplace tricks of the creationists is to describe the complexity of a biological artifact, like the eye, and then argue that such a complicated system will not function unless all its parts are complete. There will not be half an eye which would function, they would say. Now comes the statistical part – if an eye can’t function unless it is assembled in full, what are the chances that an entire eye is evolved wholesale by random mutation? Obviously, such a proposition would take a long time to accomplish. In fact, very long in the sense that the time required will be several orders of magnitude greater than the life of the universe! Dawkins, however, damns the argument in his exemplary style. He postulates that the eye need not be a whole organ to perform its function well. Hundreds of eye designs are seen in nature that varies in utility from rudimentary light detection to complex 3-D full-colour vision. All intermediate eyes are living contented lives in their animal bodies. In fact, evolution of the eye has taken place independently around forty times in the animal kingdom. This topic is a favourite one of the author, as we can see it mentioned in his other books as well, notably The Greatest Show on Earth. He adds dance of honeybees as a bonus in this book. This tells about the way in which a bee ‘describes’ about the location of food to its fellows in the hive in the form of a peculiar dance following the figure of ‘8’. What the author asserts is that even though the information interchange is very complicated and ingenuous, its development was not the result of any design, but only by the evolutionary pathways. Dawkins appears to be well versed in programming and with concepts in modern communication engineering about how to transmit sound and picture over long distances without much loss. His narration of the differences between analog and digital signals is impressive. The supreme ease with which he makes comparison with the digital engineering systems and its biological counterparts helps readers to understand the concepts very well. The most commendable achievement might be the correct identification of DNA coding to be digital. Just as a digital system is a way of working with 1s and 0s, or two states of voltage levels, the DNA is coded with four digits, usually abbreviated as A, T, C and G. Dawkins assumes a fictitious scenario in which a message in ordinary English is interspersed in the genetic sequence of a life form without losing its effectiveness in carrying genetic information that is absolutely necessary for the life of the animal. A queer thought may be presented here as an armchair exercise. What if our entire genome are in fact messages in the language of a super-powerful alien race that somehow colonized the earth in its early phase and deposited the primordial DNA to see how it works? Most of the DNA is believed to be junk in the sense that no useful genes have been detected on these portions. But it is inconceivable that nature would go to the trouble of maintaining so large a part of the DNA for no apparent reason. Isn’t the thought intriguing that these junk regions contain some coded message from another race? It is the realm of science fiction, and if you replace it with divine language, believers could also be taken along. So, it is a double edged sword.The book is highly recommended."
41,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35607063-mary-karam,3,"I set out reading this book wanting to understand evolution better (especially from the naturalistic perspective that Richard Dawkins holds) and the book succeeded partially in that, I still think I need further explanation of the theory itself, but the author did have an interesting and somewhat accessible method of explanation.While I think Dawkins' worldview implications are dangerous and that acting as if they are a result of scientific observation is hugely misleading (that could be seen clearly in his infamous quote about our dancing to DNA, concluding that there's no good and evil since nature's utility function isn't *apparently* consistent with a creator God)But man, the bee dance! Biology is fascinating! And I did enjoy those bits of the book. I only disagree with the author's driving materialistic worldview, but whether the underlying mechanism is gradualism or direct design, I still appreciate the sheer beauty of it all and I believe it is absolutely necessary to follow those curiosity-intriguing challenges of science and seek a better understanding of our world... I follow in that belief a long tradition of scientists who believed in God and made marvellous advances in science...Putting aside the anticipated sarcastic remarks the author gives every now and then on objections to evolution, sometimes he manages to contradict himself in some statements...It feels like Dawkins is pushing the evolutionary theory to fit more and more into his overall worldview, but sometimes evolution, being a developing theory, doesn't need this.. It needn't be the ""evolution of the gaps"" but it can sit comfortably in areas where our understanding is still developing... Perhaps he's only trying to theoretically explore all of the possibilities but that seemed contradictory at some points with some unwarranted extrapolation."

It is not success that makes good genes. It is good genes that make success, and nothing an individual does during its lifetime has any effect whatever upon its genes."" ""A female digger wasp not only lays her egg in a caterpillar (or grasshopper or bee) so that her larva can feed on it but, according to Fabre and others, she carefully guides her sting into each ganglion of the prey’s central nervous system, so as to paralyze it but not kill it. This way, the meat keeps fresh.""""Males of the blue-headed wrasse are large and bright-colored, and they hold harems of dull-colored females. Some females are larger than others, and they form a dominance hierarchy.

Why?Dawkins seems clever, not a scholar erudite, because he is permanently inhabited by a Schadenfreude, a cruel smile towards those who are ruled by superstitions and dogma. No wonder he is ferociously condemned for his self-sufficient arrogance. MEME I like the positivity that emanates from what he says. Is an optimistic guy, and his empathy for natural world, without exception, derives from the first hypothesis of the book: all living creatures that currently exist (including man) are the winers' offsprings in the struggle for survival and reproduction of the genetic fund. We are the followers of winners in natural selection. The uninterrupted flow of life has brought us here:  Not a single one of our ancestors was felled by an enemy, or by a virus, or by a misjudged footstep on a cliff edge, before bringing at least one child into the world. The idea of evolution through DNA replication inspired R.D. to find a metaphor for Darwinian theory: a river of genes, that is, after all, a digital River, has borne our inheritance on its waves until nowadays. Evolution is imagined as a river in which genes interfere within a species. Sometimes the river breaks in its arms, like a delta, giving birth to a new species. Then there are examples of complex mechanisms (e.g. the eye) and the simple way in which these appeared and were passed on to the next generations. The pages on bees dance are of remarkable poeticity.It's an easy read if we think it's a science book that can break down some well-rooted myths form our pious heads. Dawkins writes fluently without having a style to amaze us but he is coherent, consistent and ""well"" intentioned.Unfortunately, Dawkins is famous especially for his atheism, more than for scientific erudition. In a few documentaries that he realized, people yells at Dawkins that evolutionism is only a theory. It's disconcerting you have always to come across individuals with resistance to evidence. In the name of truth, R.D. is ready to face any showdown.In the last chapter is described a replication bomb started on our planet. This slow 4 billion-years bomb, fueled by solar energy, is described in 9 threshold:1. The replicator threshold2. The Phenotype Threshold3. The Replicator Team Threshold4. The Many-Cells Threshold5.

Articles about scientists disliking him and how he misrepresents science as a medium to challenge religious beliefs haven't helped either. I have my own problems with religion but I could do without a 350 page thesis refuting ideas a majority of the world finds comfort in. However, this book only focuses on the evolutionary biology, and does so in the most readable manner. Like explaining science to a 10 year old, but not quite undermining the reader's intelligence either. It is short and succinct and presents some interesting new information besides the run-of-the-mill Darwinian theory. Particularly liked the African Eve theory and the information explosion theory of why we have likely not heard from our intergalactic neighbours and are possibly not going to anytime soon.Maybe the world would do better in recognizing the man for his science than his opinion on religion.

I'd recommend this to teenagers or adolescents as an entry to the topic. I want to highlight a chapter where the author talks about how imperfect nature is and how it is easy to fool animals, insects and humans. It is a reply to the ""nature and everything in it is so perfect that it must be designed by god himself"" argument. He shows that evolution works precisely because it's imperfect.

55,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76430209-gabriella,4,"Really interesting look into genetics and how genes have survived through the generations, since the dawn of time. Dawkins writes clearly and creatively in a way that makes science almost mesmerising. A fascinating read. The only downside was that I didn't feel it was long enough, so I've bought myself a copy of The Selfish Gene to continue reading his books!"
56,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26187865-herb-andy,4,"Excellent short introduction to Richard Dawkins' views on evolution. It's concise, informative and full of fascinating facts about behaviour in the animal and insect world. His enthusiasm for the natural world just pours off the pages. Dawkins is one of the clearest voices of Reason that we currently have - a highly recommended read."
57,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40353104-cong-bui,5,"Not only a great introduction to Darwin’s evolutionary biology, this is also a fascinating read with so beautiful (and sometimes challenging) logic it will blow your mind. Happy with current partial understanding but I’d definitely reread it as well as looking into other relevant materials to grasp the ideas presented in the book to a greater extend."
58,0465069908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5049093-corey-sitar,5,This is a great entry book to Darwinism. Dawkins has an amazing way of explaining complex biology to people with little to no scientific acumen. This particular work is a great way to access the arguments in favor of evolution and spark an interest in exploring more in Dawkins' other books or in books by other scientific authors.
