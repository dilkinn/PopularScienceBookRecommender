Although Apollo 8 doesn't have the inherent drama of the Apollo 13 mission, which Kluger and Lovett wrote about, the narrative is engrossing and riveting. NASA badly needed a success after the deaths of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1967 while testing Apollo 1. And so did an America entrenched in a spiraling war, enduring multiple assassinations, and experiencing civic unrest. Getting to the moon by 1970, as President Kennedy had challenged, seemed more unlikely than ever. Apollo 1 and the Saturn V rocket had both failed. The Vietnam war was draining our coffers and the space program was losing support. NASA had to buckle down and recommit to excellence. Gemini 7 astronauts Borman and Lovell were slated to spend fourteen days in space as human 'lab rats'. Then came the idea of sending Gemini 6 up after launching Gemini 7, a joint mission that would allow the spacecraft to approach each other to prove that docking could be possible. It was just the huge success NASA, and the country needed. As I read about Borman and Lovell and Gemini 6 and 7 I remembered my scrapbook with clippings and pages of articles.Next up was Apollo 8, the second manned Apollo mission, which was to orbit the moon in December 1968, paving the way for Apollo 11 and a lunar landing. Anders, Borman, and Lovett had sixteen weeks to prepare. It was a crazy risk. It was so interesting to read about the astronaut's life in space: motion sickness, meals, personal needs, illness, accidents, boredom--and the wonder of being the first humans to see Earth wholly suspended in the infinite universe. ""This must be what God sees,"" Borman thought when he saw Earth. The amazing astronaut's wives stories are also impressive, accepting the risks of their husband's career and keeping home and children 'normal' in spite of legions of news reporters surrounding their homes.By the time of Apollo 8 my scrapbook days were over. But that mission had changed how my generation saw the world, spurring a new environmental awareness. Ander's photograph Earthrise was the first to impact Earthling's view of their place in the universe, a lesson was have sadly forgotten. This fragile, amazing planet is our home. I received a free ebook from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."

This book will grant you knowledge about the formation of NASA , the political tensions that contributed to it and some aspects of the Cold war in the 1960's. Highly recommend it if you are interested in space exploration ...but be warned this is a dense work and there are big chapters with no or very small interruptions."
2,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1928315-jim,3,"Very well written pop history. Kluger also co-write 
Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13
 with Astronaut Jim Lovell that the movie Apollo 13 is based on. He is a clear fan of the space program and that shows through in this book. There is very little here NASA's public relations office would disapprove of. It is a straight ahead history of the December 1968 mission of Apollo 8, focusing primarily on Frank Borman, commander of the mission, with a somewhat lesser focus on the other crew members - Jim Lovell and Bill Anders. He also spotlights some of the managers, technicians, and engineers at NASA who made the mission possible, particularly Cris Kraft, Gene Kranz, and Jim Webb Kluger does a nice job with the narrative that does keep you interested throughout. If your sole interest is the mission itself and not the messy crap that happens behind the scenes when human beings are involved, this is the book for you. It was engrossing in that sense.If you are looking for more behind the scenes stuff, the political and turf wars at NASA, how the Astronauts interacted with each other and with NASA, the finger pointing after the Apollo 1 fire, and more than a superficial look at the private lives of those involved, there isn't too much here.If you are looking for an deeper analysis of Apollo 8's impact on America and the world, you won't get much of that here either; Kluger begins with the assumption that the mission had a positive, even transcendent impact.An example of this is his treatment of the Astronauts' famous Christmas message from the moon in which they read passages from the Book of Genesis. Kluger treats this as a defining moment in the flight, and doesn't even attempt to question whether it was appropriate. In fact Madalyn Murray O'Hair, America's most hated atheist, sued the U.S. Government claiming it violated the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment. And while the suit was dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction, NASA never allowed it to happen again. As an atheist myself I have to say I wince a bit when I hear those transmissions, and in my view O'Hair had a case. But in truth I was not all that bothered by it. It was a different time, a dangerous time, and though the passages have no effect on me (other than eye rolls), I can see they were welcomed by a weary world at the end of a very bad year!In any case, the point is Kluger is not attempting to provoke a debate, or to look at the space program in a wider context. He is telling the story of the Apollo 8 flight to the moon, and that's it. In this he succeeds admirably. If that is all you are looking for, it is well worth a read.Note: I listened to the audio version of this book. Besides the book, Kluger's recorded interview with Frank Borman is included as well as an edited version of mission transmissions. A nice bonus!"

I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in space exploration."
4,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,Outstanding account of the Apollo 8 mission to orbit the moon. Extremely well-written and captures the intensity and emotion of the times.Highly recommended! 
5,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim,4,"I grew up during the 1960's. It was an eventful time. There was the Vietnam war, protests, assassinations, and the Cold War. And there was the space race between the United States and Russia. President Kennedy had challenged us to put a man on the moon and return him safely before the end of the decade. When there was a space launch or splashdown it was an event. People stopped what they were doing and watched it on television. Many made the trip to Florida to watch the launch in person. In bedrooms and classrooms there were posters of the moon. In school there were model rocket clubs. Magazines like Life and Time were filled with stories of the astronauts and the missions.It wasn't all glory and success. There was tragedy. On January 27, 1967 astronauts Virgil I. ""Gus"" Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee were killed in a cabin fire that destroyed the Apollo 1 command module during a launch rehearsal test. Manned Apollo flights were suspended for 20 months while the accident was investigated. The United States badly needed something positive. Apollo 8 provided that when it was most needed.The crew on Apollo 8 was Frank F. Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders. They had originally been slated to fly an Earth orbit in early 1969 but the mission profile was changed in August 1968. Apollo 8 launched on December 21, 1968. It took 68 hours to travel the distance to the Moon and orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours. On Christmas Eve the crew read the first ten verses from the Book of Genesis in a television broadcast which at the time was the most watched TV program ever. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon on it's fourth orbit they witnessed an ""Earthrise"" in person for the first time in human history. This event was captured in a color photograph by Bill Anders and has become one of the most famous photographs in history. The mission was summed up in a telegram Frank Borman received from a stranger ... ""Thank you Apollo 8. You saved 1968"".Jeffrey Kluger does an excellent job of providing an inside story of the space program. Frank Borman is the central character but you meet many of the astronauts and their families as well as the members of Mission Control. It isn't just the story of Apollo 8 or even the Apollo space program. You learn about earlier flights during the Gemini missions. You learn about some of the less glamorous aspects of space flight. Even astronauts get space sick and being sealed in a capsule for long periods can have negative times. An excellent story that takes you inside and gives you a glimpse never seen before and brings to life a special time in history.As I write this review we are once again experiencing turbulent times. Having read this book I am hopeful that we can experience something as positive."
6,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,4,"The Earth from here is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space - Jim Lovell, Apollo 8 astronautIf you asked me, before I started this book, to name a few Apollo missions, I of course would have mentioned Apollo 11 and - perhaps after some deep thinking - Apollo 13, the one from Houston, we have a problem.Apollo 8 definitely would not come to mind, which is why is was so pleasantly surprised by this book. After all, it was the Apollo 8 mission which really laid the groundwork for Armstrong’s first steps on the moon by sending the first humans in flight beyond the earth and around the moon. And return, lest we forget.The main focus is on commander Frank Borman who is followed from early youth until his application at NASA and his subsequent career as an astronaut. The Apollo 8 crew was the first to launch atop the powerful Saturn V rocket, lifting off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida bringing them to the moon, and the far side of the moon which no human eyes had ever seen. It was this mission that produced the famous earthrise picture.The book never becomes to technical, explaining most concept in such a way that even I could understand them. Also, by sharing the stories of the wives left behind, it is here and there emotional. I never knew that each astronaut’s wife would get a squawk box on which they could listen in on the conversation, although NASA, thoughtfully, had built in a 2 second delay, so they could shut it down if their husbands would crash and die.I listened the audiobook, so the interview between the author and Frank Bormann was a plus.All in all, I liked the book. Anyone that is interested in space travel, or science in general, should give this book certainly attention. "
7,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This is a pop ""science"" read. It holds all the bells and whistles of the facts and progressions. But for me, it lacked the ambiance between and among. The politics of it and also the ""feel"" of it. I was young then and it was a year I remember well. Very well. As was the year after. In fact, they nearly stand apart- like ""another shore"" when you are looking across what I'd call a life lake that's at least a couple miles wide. Like seeing the Chicago skyline from Indiana, you can still at times differentiate the buildings. And I find this has all the ""stuff"" that was this mission and just before and after. But without the true glue that photos for this era/topic never seem to expose. Most of them just don't. Because the feel was immense of ""being there"" on the cusp of immense discovery. Not just in the Genesis message transmission either (even then the atheists detested that and now the humans are not ""allowed"" such open expressions- just silly trivia conversations)-but from earliest to latest days of Sputnik to the landings of the next years-this feeling reigned. And this was a large step that somehow the ""onus"" feeling of/for the entire nation, maybe most of the world- it doesn't grab the adrenaline or the inspirations that WERE. Oh! did they exist. And here they barely show a dimple to what they were. You didn't have to be young then either. My Dad cried- something I had only seen before when someone died. Having lived through times that get portrayed in a different shade or context to the era- somehow it just colors the whole way too much for me. And makes these people and astronauts as almost ""robot"" like perfections and heroes of Medal of Honor levels at all times. And I don't think they were that at all. Nor did the entire operation and facets of it between government, people, scientists etc. seem all on the ""same page"" as it does glimpse here to this book's ""eyes"". But maybe I read too much and it's just that other books have done it so much better. The books of that time's and just afterwards of a decade more when space human travel was ""left"" behind. I remember those books. Some especially describe and combine the reality of those competitions for the first 7 seven Mercury Astronauts picked. Others of latter admissions after the accident (3 expired on the pad) that I've read have been so much better. And also real toward the constructs (complex and often combative). I liked the photos included better than the copy by an entire star."
8,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,3," 3.5 starsFirst of all, it wasn’t exactly what I had expected. Because of the title and the blurb I thought this would be a book about the Apollo 8 mission. It is of course. But it takes a long time to get there.It’s more about everything that happened with the Space Program from the formation of NACA (and later NASA) through to the Apollo 8 mission.This turned out to be a good thing. Because these were exciting times when we hadn’t even been in earth orbit but in no time dreamt up going to the moon.The book plunges into the background of a lot of the astronauts and NASA staff. Here it all got a little distracting for me. While it’s clear the author has to make the reader care about the protagonists, there was simply too much of this. I lost track a few times who was doing what exactly before they became part of the Space Program. Some of this could have been streamlined in my opinion. At least a bit more focus on the main characters and maybe one or two other persons would have been nice. I don’t need to know the résumé of nearly every person mentioned in the book. I really don’t.Also, while I get that most of these people signed up for defending their country, I simply can't connect at all with their repeatedly mentioned eagerness for taking part in live action. War can never be a good thing in my opinion. Necessary maybe, but nothing to be excited about. So this actually worked against me sympathizing with the protagonists.There are also some parts devoted to the political background at the respective times, focusing on the USA of course. This was quite interesting to read. So no complaints there. But the book is at its best when it focuses on the actual Space Program, the fantastic machines involved, the bravery of the astronauts and the decisive people in command.Being an astronaut is (or was?) a lot of childrens' dream I guess. After reading Mary Roach’s hilarious  Packing for Mars maybe one or the other would have changed their mind. Because as it turns out life aboard a spacecraft isn’t all that pleasant after all. And everything you have to endure to get there in the first place really is a grind. This book captures this aspect perfectly well. It is also very frank about the dangers involved, at a time when space travel was still in its infancy. Especially eye opening was one chapter in the early parts of the book, when one of the astronauts told his wife he was going to the moon. Something nobody had ever done before. She supported her husband without complaining or even questioning. But for her own sake she also asked NASA's director of flight operations about the chances her husband would return alive. The percentages were quite shocking for me, but nothing she wouldn’t expect. These women were real heroines themselves in my opinion.Of course some of the early tragedies are also covered in this book. Maybe it’s a good thing the author doesn’t go to deep into the aftermath. To me this seemed a respectful way. You already knew by then what these wives and children had to go through. I like to believe they were very strong people and managed to cope with it somehow.The actual Apollo 8 mission starts around the halfway point. And while this was a sensational achievement, it didn't always feel like the apex of this book. How exciting it must have been, when we still dared to reach for the stars. Sometimes the author manages to capture this. Sometimes he doesn't.I think this book should have been a five star read, because of the fascinating story it has to tell. But it wasn't. Sometimes the author strayed too far from the Space Program and it became kind of a grind.I'm still sitting a bit on the fence whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. But I'm going with my gut feeling and round down to 3 stars for now.Knowing what to expect of it, this may very well be bumped up to 4 stars upon a re-read."

For me this was a random audio selection that I was afraid might be boring and predictable and that opened up that way, almost. Honestly, the word ""thrilling"" in the title was enough to make me suspicious. But it was freely available from my library on audio and worth a try. Kluger won me over completely. I was a bit interested and then really interested and then maybe even caught some of the excitement of the era as television audiences around the globe stopped to watch these three astronauts orbiting the moon. I think the book just manages to have the structure to bring you to each moment, to make prolonged rather mundane activities by the crew in the long space voyage feel like fascinating critical parts of the story. So, a fun rewarding book, recommended to anyone who stumbles across it and thinks they might be interested.-----------------------------------------------29.

And what great timing it was. Then, as now, the country and the world was extremely angry and uncertain. What a magnificent thing that everybody could unite to cheer on such an audacious feat of human innovation and imagination. I think I had a smile on my face the entire time I read this. Some reviewers here have said they prefer Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff, a book first and foremost about how much Tom Wolfe loves Tom Wolfe's writing. Jeffrey Kluger, on the other hand, is a lifelong journalist who knows how to tell a story with style without overbearing his characters. And when it comes to astronauts, there are a hell of a lot of characters. Don't get me wrong, The Right Stuff is thrilling, but man, I enjoyed Apollo 8 so much more (and! his prose never made me roll my eyes to the back of my head). There actually isn't a lot of overlap — in many ways Kluger picks up where Wolfe left off. "
11,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5,Outstanding. If you read this be sure to go online and watch the liftoff of Apollo 8 and the coverage of the mission. A great bit of history.
12,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67579991-jay-pruitt,4,"This story was amazing! Although many of us know much about Apollo 11 and 13, I'd wager few could tell you what Apollo 8 was all about. In many respects it was the most daring and thrilling of them all. First humans to go to the moon, first to lay eyes on its backside, first to see the ""earthrise"" as they came around the vast grey darkness to gaze upon the gorgeous blue planet rising upon the moon's horizon. 230 thousand miles from home. Words can't really describe.....but Apollo 8: The Thrilling Story does a good job trying!"
13,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31555322-christopher,4,"Apollo 8: The Thrilling Story of the First Mission to the Moon is by Jeffrey Kluger, veteran reporter from Time magazine. This is his second book about the Apollo program. His earlier book was Lost Moon (aka Apollo 13), where he was co-writer with Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell.Lost Moon may be credited first to Lovell, but I believe Kluger was the primary writer of that book. No disrespect to Lovell, but the book has the hallmarks of a seasoned journalist. The writing is exceptional, and the mission is covered in appropriate detail in all phases. The epilogue study of the Apollo 13 accident is also one of the book's high points. Of all the many Apollo books I've read over the years, I consider it one of the best.For many years, there was a woeful lack of serious coverage of Apollo 8, a mission I personally consider one of the greatest in history--possibly even more so than Apollo 11, the first human landing on the moon. Apollo 8 is only the second book devoted to the first human trip around the moon. I had read Robert Zimmerman's Genesis--the first book covering that mission--many years before. Genesis is very good in a number of ways, but it was also lacking in a number of ways, too. Zimmerman is earnest in his assessments of the historical significance of the mission, and drills down to a couple of reasonable conclusions. One of those conclusions follows a solid investigation of which Apollo 8 astronaut took the famous 'earthrise' photo, which has become one of the most significant photographs in history. Zimmerman also goes a bit overboard with his contextualizing, his comparison of cold war superpowers, and his justification of why the Apollo 8 crew read from the Book of Genesis.Zimmerman's book is good--sometimes very good. But the writing is kind of pedestrian, and probably needed a stronger editor to refine the book's organization and develop parts that were left kind of thin. The storyline should have been more linear--for example, he opened the book with a description of launch day, which to me was a bit premature. Instead, the writing jumps around and digresses off-topic a bit too much. While Zimmerman's book was a welcome contribution to the history of this monumental but not-well-documented mission, it was also an invitation for a better writer to fill the empty spaces the author left.For years, I lamented that none of the Apollo 8 astronauts seemed interested in taking on this opportunity. At one point, I sent an e-mail to the Lovell family through their restaurant in Chicago, asking that Mr. Lovell consider documenting this mission in a similar manner to Lost Moon. I was sent back a nice but noncommittal, generically signed note in return, perhaps wary that I might have been hinting at a collaboration (suffice it to say, it was not meant that way).That was many years ago. Around the turn of 2017, Jeffrey Kluger, Lovell's collaborator on Lost Moon, tweeted that he was preparing to publish his own book about Apollo 8. Finally, this mission would have coverage from a professional journalist. I was thrilled, knowing that Kluger was probably the best writer for this task. I looked forward to its release date, and I picked up the new book soon after its publication.This is a saved draft. Full review is pending."
14,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5630113-audrey,4,"I’ve already read Kluger’s Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, and I’m a pretty big space nerd. If the space program or the science behind it does not interest you, the book probably won’t, either.The first half of the book follows the events leading up to the launch of Apollo 8. It particularly follows the biography Frank Borman, the mission leader, and the general progress of the space program. The second half was the mission itself. This was the first time human eye saw the whole earth as a sphere. It was the first time eyes saw the far side of the moon. Crewman Bill Anders took the famous photo “Earthrise” on this mission:

The writing really drew me in for the most part. I really felt like I was there. I got teary reading about Apollo 1 despite knowing everything about it already; I could feel the g forces experienced during reentry; I felt the sense of wonder throughout."
15,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1872724-brian,5,"Very engaging book about the early Apollo missions, focusing on Frank Borman, the commander of Apollo 8. I learned a lot about the missions - in many ways number 8 may have been as important as number 11. A must read for ""space nerds""."

17,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene,5,"Originally published at Reading RealityAnyone who has lived in Chicagoland knows that while expressways may be designated official numbers from the DOT, no one ever calls them by those numbers. Highways in Chicagoland have names; the Ryan, the Kennedy, the Ike. And if you travel through Northwest Indiana, the Borman.The Borman is named for Frank Borman, the native Hoosier who was one of the first three people to see the far side of the moon with his own eyes, up close and personal. Frank Borman was the commander of Apollo 8, the first mission by any country to send humans around the far side of the moon.They may not have landed there, that honor was bestowed on Apollo 11, but they were the first humans to leave not merely the Earth, but to entirely leave Earth’s gravitational field and become temporary residents of a different celestial body, in orbit around the Earth’s moon.Apollo 8 is the story of not just that one mission, but of as much as possible of everything that came before it. Frank Borman was not one of the original Gemini astronauts. He just missed inclusion in that celebrated group with the “right stuff”. He was, however, part of the second class of astronauts, merely referred to as the “next eight”.It’s always the ones who get there first who get all the good names.So this is the story of not just the crew of Apollo 8, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, and of their lives and careers in NASA up to that point, but it is also the story of NASA itself. Now that’s a story of “big science”, where there are many, many people who give significant portions of their lives to work together for what they hope (and in this case they were right) is a cause greater than themselves.There are heroes here, too. Names we’re familiar with like Gene Krantz and Deke Slayton. (Krantz was the Mission Controller who helped bring Apollo 13 back from the brink.) But there are plenty of both sung and unsung heroes among this early corps of NASA movers, shakers and believers, and the author does a skillful job of weaving the parts that they play into the narrative of this one, singular mission.It is also the story of America in the 1960s. While this book does not attempt to portray the entirety of that tumultuous decade – nor should it – within its narrow scope it does set the missions of NASA in general and Apollo 8 in particular into their historic context. Not just the story of what was done, but why it was done and how it felt to be a part of or even watch as it was done.And to show why the space program was so important. What it did, and what it celebrated. And just how much was accomplished and how many people around the world celebrated with it.Reality Rating A: I have a very soft spot in my heart for anything to do with NASA and the space program. I was a child during the 1960s, and the space program, its successes and its tragic failures, formed part of the backdrop of my earliest years.We accomplished so much. We went so far, and we showed such promise. And now it seems to be gone. Not just the adventure itself, but the promise of the future it provided and the surprising amount of unity it engendered.(Readers interested in a bigger picture of exactly what it means that we don’t go into space much anymore should read Leaving Orbit: Notes from the Last Days of American Spaceflight by Margaret Lazarus Dean)Apollo 8, the book, does a terrific job at showing the importance, the risks and the rewards of Apollo 8, the mission. By focusing on the smaller perspective of the three astronauts, and particularly Borman, it allows the author to paint the broader picture in a way that allows readers to empathize with the people and to grasp the size and scope of NASA’s operation and how it worked – and how it occasionally didn’t with disastrous results.So while the focus is on Borman, Lovell and Anders, this is also very much a book about “big science”. And like The Interstellar Age: Inside the Forty-Year Voyager Mission by Jim Bell, it does a good job of making that “big science” comprehensible. And makes the reader wish they could have been there.I found Apollo 8 to be compelling reading, to the point where I began by listening on audio and then switched to print to see what happened faster, even though I already knew what happened. I was absorbed in the details and the perspectives. As glad as I was to have the crew get back safely, theirs was a journey that I never wanted to see end.But it did. As did our journey with them."
18,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51144930-krist-ne-l-cis,5,"Superbly written account of an often-overlooked, but historic first lunar orbit. The author has done a remarkable job of placing the NASA efforts to reach Moon against the backdrop of international and domestic situation, when ""It was the boiling summer of 1968, and the world had spent much of the year bleeding from countless wounds: multiple wars, serial assassinations, riots and unrest from Washington to Prague to Paris to Southeast Asia /../ while American boys died in Vietnam at a rate of more than a thousand each month"". It gives entirely new appreciation to the thought that ""A flight to the moon—which President Kennedy had once promised would happen by 1970—would have been a fine and bracing achievement right about now"". And it certainly helps to understand - from the 2017 perspective - the risks NASA was ready to take in terms of cutting corners on testing and accelerating the project. ""If you read all the stories in the newspapers and magazines, you couldn’t help but believe that the space agency was showing and telling you everything you needed to know about how it went about its business. The space agency, however, was also good at keeping a very big secret: half the time their engineers were just making things up as they went along"".The prose sounds more like a light banter - ""Borman did land the smoldering aircraft, and then, as soon as he quit taxiing, he hopped from the cockpit and abided by one more iron rule of piloting: he ran as fast and as far as he could from the plane"". But it also paints a very vivid portrait of the three astronauts of Apollo 8 and their families, and delivers the barely comprehensible list of first, from ""Before the astronauts of Apollo 8 had even shed their heavy pressure suits and donned the white jumpsuits they would wear throughout their mission, they had already traveled farther from Earth than any person ever had"", to ""The astronauts had seen the Earth and they had seen the moon, but this was the first time they were seeing them together—the ugly, broken world beneath them and the lovely, breakable one in front of them"". The book is filled with tidbits of curious facts, like the creation of the famous ""Earthrise"" photo, loved it.There was no established way for a man to tell his wife he was going to the moon. A man could tell his wife he was going to sea or going to war; men had been doing that for millennia. But the moon? It was a whole new conversation."

I was wrong.Apollo 8 not only details the actual three days of the mission, but also the ups-and-downs and ins-and-outs of the entire US space program leading up to the eventual lunar loop made by the Apollo 8 mission. I finished the book with a renewed awe of the unbridled ingenuity, sheer willpower, and lockstep teamwork required to accomplish one of mankind's greatest achievements. I specifically appreciated reading about the trials and tribulations of the 'crew behind the crew', the men and women who don't put on the space suits but keep the myriad problems at bay. The mission itself was thrilling, not because anything catastrophic happened, but because we get a live look into the reaction of humans carving out just that tiny slice of understanding from the vast unknown of outer space. The author does a tremendous job of filling in the gaps between the historical notes, recordings, and interviews. The detailed character profiles add a richness to the story and dialogue. In fact, everyone and everything is so interesting, it's hard to believe it's all real. It's a testament to the depth of the history behind flying to the moon. This book isn't just a biography about space travel, it's about who and what it takes to do the impossible."
20,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37785231-ryan,5,"All I can say is I love space and I picked up this book for that reason alone. Not until I was finished did I learn that Jefferey Kluger also wrote Apollo 13, a movie I loved watching when I was little (note to self: check to see if it's on Netflix).This is the story of the first manned flight to the Moon. Astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders were absolute rock stars, but time has faded the memory of their names and replaced them with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. A small history of the space program is given, including the Gemini program and the setbacks of the early Apollo program and tragedy of Apollo 1. Kluger does a great job as the storyteller, without tying down the reader with too much technical jargon and allowing the emotions of the families and NASA employees to come through the pages."
21,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6720386-reija,3,I have watched From Earth to the Moon so many times that there wasn't much new information here but still quite nice story.
22,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,5,"I'm not sure a better book could be written about the underappreciated Apollo 8 mission. Jeffrey Kluger does a great job of providing fascinating details (e.g. the astronauts had to be careful about venting their urine out of the spacecraft because the mechanism squirting it out was essentially a tiny thruster that could knock them slightly, but significantly, off course). Apollo 8 delivers high drama and even though you know the astronauts survive, Kluger still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. He also does a great job of explaining all the technical details with a clarity that make everything easy to understand. This book is inspiring and renewed my sense of the courage, skill, patriotism, and audacity of the men who went to the moon."
23,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8369202-katie,3,"Reading this book showed me that it truly was a miracle we ever made it to the moon. Kluger details all of the challenges of creating and operating a spacecraft that led up to the Apollo 8 mission. Most upsetting to me was the section about the cabin fire that destroyed Apollo 1 and killed the 3 astronauts inside. Overall I felt that this described the evolution of the space program well but I felt that the narrative was dry. It took me a long time to finish reading this, but part of that could also be that I so strongly related to many of the frustrations around tools and systems not working appropriately. I also felt that there was a lot of ego involved in naming craters after the various men who worked on the mission—while I understand this is a part of history I just wanted to skim through it as information that wasn’t important to me. I think that some conversations also could have been paraphrased to move the story along, but others may enjoy the back-and-forth dialogue. See more of my reviews: Blog // Instagram"
24,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/424081-peter,5,"As a bit of a NASA junkie, I love Kluger's straightforward telling of history. This book didn't disappoint. "

I was moved more times then I'd like to admit. My only disappointment was that the author sailed past the religious side of the astronauts, especially the Christmas Eve address. You can watch the Christmas Eve Address on YouTube and it is well worth the time. It was absolutely beautiful and awe inspiring. Genesis one was the ideal background audio for the first broadcast of the farside of the moon. Kluger writing was fascinating. He explained the science and the gravity behind the apollo program perfectly."
26,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,4,"Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. (Unfortunately, life's bad timing meant that by the time I was finally old enough to be one, we didn't have space shuttles any more. Life can be cruel.) Since then, I have tried to read just about every history, memoir, or other book about NASA's space programs. I used to write to NASA and ask them to send me information, and would spend hours reading mission profiles. (This was before the Internet, back when you either had to have a book or encyclopedia or write to people to get information.) I attended Space Camp after I'd saved up all of my allowance for several years.But I digress. Another book about the space program? Even after I've already read so many? Even though it's about events that occurred 50 years ago? HELL. YES.The story of Apollo 8 is of course the story about the first mission around the moon, but not the first lunar landing (which would occur during Apollo 11). You get the idea that for astronauts at the time, this was a huge deal, but still was unfortunately overshadowed by the simple fact that while they got so darn close, they didn't get to touch the moon. As happened with many of the original astronauts, their fame was very fleeting. They were the first American in the world to do X, until the next guy up did X+1. By Apollo, they were the first *people* in the world to do X, and then the next crew did X+1. The epitome being, of course, the immortal Apollo 11. If you ask anybody to name an astronaut, they'll probably name Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, or maybe John Glenn. Which is why it's so important to tell the stories of the ""other"" astronauts. While Apollo could be argued as a mission solely embarked upon to ""beat the Soviets,"" nonetheless the science, engineering and technology that went into the missions were unbelievable. And as we've learned (the hard way, three times, again and again) from the disasters in the space program, there's also an element of business management, government contracts, and quality control that is just as important an aspect of the space program. (Content note: this book describes the Apollo 1 disaster in great detail. I have a hard time reading about that incident, and this made me feel ill. It was written about in a very tactful manner, I just hate that three people died because of incompetent engineering and bad business practices.)This book being what it is, a very interesting, involved, detailed look into the lives of three (and more) astronauts, many members of mission control, and the missions that were required as the lead up to Apollo 8, I still can't help but think ""when will this country get to a point in time where all of the books I read about the space program feature an equal number of women and men, and where not all of the women are just astronaut wives?"""
27,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5939619-william,3,"I really wanted to love this book, but it fell short of my expectations given the subject and the author. I liked it and it is probably a good Apollo 8 history for most readers, but for true space geeks (like me) it may disappoint. I really, really enjoyed Jeffery Kluger and Jim Lovell's ""Lost Moon"" (later renamed Apollo 13 and the basis for the Ron Howard-directed film) because it brought new insight into the Apollo 13 accident and efforts by mission control and the families of the crew. ""Apollo 8"" will bring no such new insights, but will deliver in a short book a good narrative of the events of America's race to the moon, the lives of the Apollo 8 crew and their families and a timeline of that historic mission's events.I consider the Apollo 8 and Apollo 15 missions to be the most memorable and truly inspiring Apollo flights: Apollo 8 because it was the first manned mission around the moon, and my memories of that 1968 Christmas Eve early morning black and white TV pictures ""from Lunar Orbit""--incredible. Yet Kluger does little to capture the awe and wonder of this risky and historic mission. That's unfortunate because we know he is a much better writer (and researcher: some of the technical errors in the book could have been checked in a 30sec Google search for pete's sake).If you want a definite book on Apollo read Chaikin's ""A Man on the Moon"". Zimmerman's ""Genesis"" is a great earlier book on Apollo 8. This ""Apollo 8"" is a good read--just not great. "

The author shares the backstory leading up to Borman, Lovell, and Anders's journey to the moon and back in a masterful way. The fact that Apollo 1 ended in tragedy with all 3 astronauts dead on the launchpad before liftoff less than two years before the incredible feat of Apollo 8 is a testament to the human spirit. This feat captivated the world in a way that no other event has done—1 billion people tuned in for the broadcast while the trio was in lunar orbit—and the men brought unity to the world amidst the Cold War, devastating race riots, and the middle of the Vietnam tragedy. This book is inspiring in a way that is truly unique by telling that, in the words of Borman, ""exploration is really the essence of the human spirit, and I hope we will never forget that""."

36,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester,3,"A faithful and fairly by-the-book recap of man's first mission to (orbit) the moon.If you're familiar with anything else even remotely in the same vein, whether The Right Stuff or the myriad of media about Apolloi 11 or Apollo 13, you pretty much know the script. Stoic military guys in exceptional circumstances tackle incredible and unprecedented engineering challenges and (for the most part) succeed.What has always drawn me to this type of story is the romance of it all. A story like this gives you the opportunity to empathize with the men who -- for the first time in human history -- came to view the Earth for the fragile sphere that it is. It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."

Mr. Kluger is a senior writer at Time and wrote several about the space program.This might be non-fiction, but the author makes this book read as if it is a novel – and an exciting, well written one at that. The author makes the story of the Apollo 8 mission not only personal, but also relevant and fresh.I’ve read many books about the space program, but Mr. Kluger managed to weave the personal stories of the astronauts (especially the Commander Frank Borman), along with technical details and geopolitical influences. Those subjects, related but difficult to explain, or weaved together in a narrative which makes sense and keeps the book interesting instead of bogged down like a technical manual or political science text book.Reading the book I felt as an intimate observer to the flight and the cockpit where the three astronauts (Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, see our home as a whole plant and observer the far side of the moon. Being in such small space with two other people, for a week, they must be compatible and flexible. There is even a section about the famous Earthrise photograph.This is a story about a technological marvel and human achievement, told from a personal, intimate point of view. Even if you know everything there is to know about the mission, I still believe it is a worthwhile, fascinating read.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"
40,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"Apollo 8 by Jeffrey Kluger is a story about the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."
41,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,5,"A very thrilling story, indeed! Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me. I listened to the audio version and the reader has the perfect voice for this kind of book - serious and no-nonsense. Bonus features include a short interview with Frank Borman and several audio clips from the Apollo 8 mission."
42,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"Apollo 8 is the exhilarating tale of that momentous first mission to the moon and all that led up to it. It traces through relevant histories for each of the three astronauts, including their previous trips to space during the Gemini missions. It also contains information about the successes and failures of the Gemini and previous Apollo missions, the knowledge of which went into designing and planning for subsequent missions.Kluger must have meticulously researched the material for this book, for it shows in the details. He's also a great storyteller and really brings the tale to life. While reading about the mission, I could almost see and feel everything as Kluger is describing them in the book. The more I read about astronauts, the more amazed I am by what they have to suffer mentally and physically, not to mention the toll it takes on their families, in order to be at the frontier of exploration and science. At its heart, this book is a tale of human triumph against overwhelming odds and obstacles, and I came away feeling inspired and optimistic."

The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "

I think it's a combination of the time period along with the idea of something so big and exciting that the entire world was wrapped up in. This (obviously) focuses on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to the moon - orbiting it, not landing on it. There is a fair bit of backstory working up to it that was interesting. The author spends time on the families and NASA, how the pilots (astronauts) got to where they were, and the pilots themselves. At times the science got too specific for me, but someone else might be all over that. I just really enjoyed the story. This was an audiobook and the last few tracks were snippets from the actual recordings between NASA and Apollo 8, which was quite a bonus. If you like space stuff, I would definitely recommend."

If they don't ring a bell, it's because their mission, Apollo 8, has largely been overshadowed by Apollo 11. Yet Apollo 8 set many important records, including being the first mission to orbit the moon, effectively defeating the Soviet Union in the Space Race. Kluger here brings the mission back to historical consciousness using the same writing toolkit that made Apollo 13--his book with Jim Lovell--such a gripping read. The main difference here is that Apollo 8, unlike Apollo 13, went quite well, robbing the Kluger of a key generator of suspense (namely, things going wrong=pages turning). Still, Apollo 8 is a good addition to the space book canon, and a fun-to-read portrait of an America about to land on the moon. "

When I was just 1 year old, these 3 men and NASA made this trip the greatest thing about 1968, culminating in the Earthrise photo and the reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve during a TV broadcast to record numbers. This extremely well-written account takes you through the training, lives and preparation of these men and also the emotional toll on their families during the long training and mission. The first to see the far side of the moon, these men shattered all previous records of how far man could go away from earth.

There is some vicarious nostalgia for a time like this when the nation could rally around scientific endeavors that pushed human's capabilities. Nowadays SpaceX can land a rocket back on earth for reuse and a majority of people don't know / care.There was a good level of technical detail in the book, but nothing that would overwhelm the average reader. The author did a good job of drumming up a bit of drama on what appeared to be a mostly perfect flight. This lack of true drama keeps the book from getting five stars.

This flight allowed 6 other Apollo flights to successfully land (12 Americans walked on the moon).Really pleased with this one and I’m hard to please. 🤔

How the Saturn V rocket produced upwards of 160,000,000 hp, and millions of lbs of thrust.

70,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"Apollo 8 by Jeffrey Kluger is a story about the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."
71,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,5,"A very thrilling story, indeed! Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me. I listened to the audio version and the reader has the perfect voice for this kind of book - serious and no-nonsense. Bonus features include a short interview with Frank Borman and several audio clips from the Apollo 8 mission."
72,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"Apollo 8 is the exhilarating tale of that momentous first mission to the moon and all that led up to it. It traces through relevant histories for each of the three astronauts, including their previous trips to space during the Gemini missions. It also contains information about the successes and failures of the Gemini and previous Apollo missions, the knowledge of which went into designing and planning for subsequent missions.Kluger must have meticulously researched the material for this book, for it shows in the details. He's also a great storyteller and really brings the tale to life. While reading about the mission, I could almost see and feel everything as Kluger is describing them in the book. The more I read about astronauts, the more amazed I am by what they have to suffer mentally and physically, not to mention the toll it takes on their families, in order to be at the frontier of exploration and science. At its heart, this book is a tale of human triumph against overwhelming odds and obstacles, and I came away feeling inspired and optimistic."
73,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11012805-brandon-gryder,5,"If I could give this book six stars, I would. The best book I've read this year. The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "
74,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127161-lisa-hunt,5,"4.5 stars for this one. I am so not a science-y person, but for some reason the early Astronaut program is so intriguing to me. I think it's a combination of the time period along with the idea of something so big and exciting that the entire world was wrapped up in. This (obviously) focuses on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to the moon - orbiting it, not landing on it. There is a fair bit of backstory working up to it that was interesting. The author spends time on the families and NASA, how the pilots (astronauts) got to where they were, and the pilots themselves. At times the science got too specific for me, but someone else might be all over that. I just really enjoyed the story. This was an audiobook and the last few tracks were snippets from the actual recordings between NASA and Apollo 8, which was quite a bonus. If you like space stuff, I would definitely recommend."
75,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44757478-danny-caine,4,"Before Armstrong and Aldrin, the most famous astronauts in the world were Borman, Lovell, and Anders. If they don't ring a bell, it's because their mission, Apollo 8, has largely been overshadowed by Apollo 11. Yet Apollo 8 set many important records, including being the first mission to orbit the moon, effectively defeating the Soviet Union in the Space Race. Kluger here brings the mission back to historical consciousness using the same writing toolkit that made Apollo 13--his book with Jim Lovell--such a gripping read. The main difference here is that Apollo 8, unlike Apollo 13, went quite well, robbing the Kluger of a key generator of suspense (namely, things going wrong=pages turning). Still, Apollo 8 is a good addition to the space book canon, and a fun-to-read portrait of an America about to land on the moon. "
76,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22968631-david-webber,5,"When we left earth!-- the Apollo 8 mission was the first time mankind left the confines of earth and orbited the moon, riding the massive and dangerous Saturn V rocket and inspiring the world. When I was just 1 year old, these 3 men and NASA made this trip the greatest thing about 1968, culminating in the Earthrise photo and the reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve during a TV broadcast to record numbers. This extremely well-written account takes you through the training, lives and preparation of these men and also the emotional toll on their families during the long training and mission. The first to see the far side of the moon, these men shattered all previous records of how far man could go away from earth. A great story of this important mission, including a prologue of the men after the mission."

It happened to come in the mail at one of the busiest times of my life thus far. The riveting story of the men of the Apollo 8 mission and those who worked to make that mission a reality was a welcome respite from hectic times.The story starts, as it should, well before the mission itself. The story of how the men of Apollo 8 became astronauts (and the stories of Borman & Lovell's previous missions) gave context and human texture to the story. Being a space buff for my whole life, I loved reading the details of the experience of being an astronaut and bring in space.If you have a love of space and NASA history, this book is required reading."
78,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30597556-travis-tucker,4,"Great profile of the space race -- from the early days up to the first flight to the moon. I got caught up in the excitement that the entire nation / world had for space at that time. There is some vicarious nostalgia for a time like this when the nation could rally around scientific endeavors that pushed human's capabilities. Nowadays SpaceX can land a rocket back on earth for reuse and a majority of people don't know / care.There was a good level of technical detail in the book, but nothing that would overwhelm the average reader. The author did a good job of drumming up a bit of drama on what appeared to be a mostly perfect flight. This lack of true drama keeps the book from getting five stars. I'm sure his other book, Apollo 13, fits that bill."

My husband and I listened on a road trip and had a couple of hours left when we returned home so we sat and listened to the remainder. This version has at the end an interview with Commander Frank Borman and archival audio from the lunar orbit. I found it a great companion to the movie Apollo 13 since Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is one of the crew members on Apollo 8.

I usually read a book for a bit then pick up a different book for a bit then come back to the first one but with this one I had to read it straight through.It is a great look at the first men to reach the moon and orbit it as well as the Apollo program up to that point. I very highly recommend this book
83,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17691396-adam-christian,5,I read EVERYTHING on the space race. I consider this audiobook a must read. Most forget or don’t know that the three men of Apollo 8 were the first humans to ever leave the bonds of Earth gravity. Completely free to the universe. This WAS the test flight. The math and piloting had to be perfect for them to return. This flight allowed 6 other Apollo flights to successfully land (12 Americans walked on the moon).Really pleased with this one and I’m hard to please. 🤔

It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."

Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me.

The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this.

Most forget or don’t know that the three men of Apollo 8 were the first humans to ever leave the bonds of Earth gravity. Completely free to the universe. This WAS the test flight. The math and piloting had to be perfect for them to return. This flight allowed 6 other Apollo flights to successfully land (12 Americans walked on the moon).Really pleased with this one and I’m hard to please. 🤔

How the Saturn V rocket produced upwards of 160,000,000 hp, and millions of lbs of thrust. The factuality is there, the tense emotions of the cold war, and a rivetting story which threads it all together. I haven't read Apollo 13 (by the same author), but I plan to now."

126,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester,3,"A faithful and fairly by-the-book recap of man's first mission to (orbit) the moon.If you're familiar with anything else even remotely in the same vein, whether The Right Stuff or the myriad of media about Apolloi 11 or Apollo 13, you pretty much know the script. Stoic military guys in exceptional circumstances tackle incredible and unprecedented engineering challenges and (for the most part) succeed.What has always drawn me to this type of story is the romance of it all. A story like this gives you the opportunity to empathize with the men who -- for the first time in human history -- came to view the Earth for the fragile sphere that it is. It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."

Mr. Kluger is a senior writer at Time and wrote several about the space program.This might be non-fiction, but the author makes this book read as if it is a novel – and an exciting, well written one at that. The author makes the story of the Apollo 8 mission not only personal, but also relevant and fresh.I’ve read many books about the space program, but Mr. Kluger managed to weave the personal stories of the astronauts (especially the Commander Frank Borman), along with technical details and geopolitical influences. Those subjects, related but difficult to explain, or weaved together in a narrative which makes sense and keeps the book interesting instead of bogged down like a technical manual or political science text book.Reading the book I felt as an intimate observer to the flight and the cockpit where the three astronauts (Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, see our home as a whole plant and observer the far side of the moon. Being in such small space with two other people, for a week, they must be compatible and flexible. There is even a section about the famous Earthrise photograph.This is a story about a technological marvel and human achievement, told from a personal, intimate point of view.

156,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester,3,"A faithful and fairly by-the-book recap of man's first mission to (orbit) the moon.If you're familiar with anything else even remotely in the same vein, whether The Right Stuff or the myriad of media about Apolloi 11 or Apollo 13, you pretty much know the script. Stoic military guys in exceptional circumstances tackle incredible and unprecedented engineering challenges and (for the most part) succeed.What has always drawn me to this type of story is the romance of it all. A story like this gives you the opportunity to empathize with the men who -- for the first time in human history -- came to view the Earth for the fragile sphere that it is. It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."

Mr. Kluger is a senior writer at Time and wrote several about the space program.This might be non-fiction, but the author makes this book read as if it is a novel – and an exciting, well written one at that. The author makes the story of the Apollo 8 mission not only personal, but also relevant and fresh.I’ve read many books about the space program, but Mr. Kluger managed to weave the personal stories of the astronauts (especially the Commander Frank Borman), along with technical details and geopolitical influences. Those subjects, related but difficult to explain, or weaved together in a narrative which makes sense and keeps the book interesting instead of bogged down like a technical manual or political science text book.Reading the book I felt as an intimate observer to the flight and the cockpit where the three astronauts (Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, see our home as a whole plant and observer the far side of the moon. Being in such small space with two other people, for a week, they must be compatible and flexible. There is even a section about the famous Earthrise photograph.This is a story about a technological marvel and human achievement, told from a personal, intimate point of view. Even if you know everything there is to know about the mission, I still believe it is a worthwhile, fascinating read.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"
160,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"Apollo 8 by Jeffrey Kluger is a story about the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."
161,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,5,"A very thrilling story, indeed! Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me. I listened to the audio version and the reader has the perfect voice for this kind of book - serious and no-nonsense. Bonus features include a short interview with Frank Borman and several audio clips from the Apollo 8 mission."
162,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"Apollo 8 is the exhilarating tale of that momentous first mission to the moon and all that led up to it. It traces through relevant histories for each of the three astronauts, including their previous trips to space during the Gemini missions. It also contains information about the successes and failures of the Gemini and previous Apollo missions, the knowledge of which went into designing and planning for subsequent missions.Kluger must have meticulously researched the material for this book, for it shows in the details. He's also a great storyteller and really brings the tale to life. While reading about the mission, I could almost see and feel everything as Kluger is describing them in the book. The more I read about astronauts, the more amazed I am by what they have to suffer mentally and physically, not to mention the toll it takes on their families, in order to be at the frontier of exploration and science. At its heart, this book is a tale of human triumph against overwhelming odds and obstacles, and I came away feeling inspired and optimistic."
163,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11012805-brandon-gryder,5,"If I could give this book six stars, I would. The best book I've read this year. The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "
164,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127161-lisa-hunt,5,"4.5 stars for this one. I am so not a science-y person, but for some reason the early Astronaut program is so intriguing to me. I think it's a combination of the time period along with the idea of something so big and exciting that the entire world was wrapped up in. This (obviously) focuses on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to the moon - orbiting it, not landing on it. There is a fair bit of backstory working up to it that was interesting. The author spends time on the families and NASA, how the pilots (astronauts) got to where they were, and the pilots themselves. At times the science got too specific for me, but someone else might be all over that. I just really enjoyed the story. This was an audiobook and the last few tracks were snippets from the actual recordings between NASA and Apollo 8, which was quite a bonus. If you like space stuff, I would definitely recommend."
165,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44757478-danny-caine,4,"Before Armstrong and Aldrin, the most famous astronauts in the world were Borman, Lovell, and Anders. If they don't ring a bell, it's because their mission, Apollo 8, has largely been overshadowed by Apollo 11. Yet Apollo 8 set many important records, including being the first mission to orbit the moon, effectively defeating the Soviet Union in the Space Race. Kluger here brings the mission back to historical consciousness using the same writing toolkit that made Apollo 13--his book with Jim Lovell--such a gripping read. The main difference here is that Apollo 8, unlike Apollo 13, went quite well, robbing the Kluger of a key generator of suspense (namely, things going wrong=pages turning). Still, Apollo 8 is a good addition to the space book canon, and a fun-to-read portrait of an America about to land on the moon. "

When I was just 1 year old, these 3 men and NASA made this trip the greatest thing about 1968, culminating in the Earthrise photo and the reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve during a TV broadcast to record numbers. This extremely well-written account takes you through the training, lives and preparation of these men and also the emotional toll on their families during the long training and mission. The first to see the far side of the moon, these men shattered all previous records of how far man could go away from earth. A great story of this important mission, including a prologue of the men after the mission."

The riveting story of the men of the Apollo 8 mission and those who worked to make that mission a reality was a welcome respite from hectic times.The story starts, as it should, well before the mission itself. The story of how the men of Apollo 8 became astronauts (and the stories of Borman & Lovell's previous missions) gave context and human texture to the story. Being a space buff for my whole life, I loved reading the details of the experience of being an astronaut and bring in space.If you have a love of space and NASA history, this book is required reading."

I got caught up in the excitement that the entire nation / world had for space at that time. There is some vicarious nostalgia for a time like this when the nation could rally around scientific endeavors that pushed human's capabilities. Nowadays SpaceX can land a rocket back on earth for reuse and a majority of people don't know / care.There was a good level of technical detail in the book, but nothing that would overwhelm the average reader. The author did a good job of drumming up a bit of drama on what appeared to be a mostly perfect flight. This lack of true drama keeps the book from getting five stars.

It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."

The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life.

The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me.

The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "
194,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127161-lisa-hunt,5,"4.5 stars for this one. I am so not a science-y person, but for some reason the early Astronaut program is so intriguing to me. I think it's a combination of the time period along with the idea of something so big and exciting that the entire world was wrapped up in. This (obviously) focuses on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to the moon - orbiting it, not landing on it. There is a fair bit of backstory working up to it that was interesting. The author spends time on the families and NASA, how the pilots (astronauts) got to where they were, and the pilots themselves. At times the science got too specific for me, but someone else might be all over that. I just really enjoyed the story. This was an audiobook and the last few tracks were snippets from the actual recordings between NASA and Apollo 8, which was quite a bonus. If you like space stuff, I would definitely recommend."
195,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44757478-danny-caine,4,"Before Armstrong and Aldrin, the most famous astronauts in the world were Borman, Lovell, and Anders. If they don't ring a bell, it's because their mission, Apollo 8, has largely been overshadowed by Apollo 11. Yet Apollo 8 set many important records, including being the first mission to orbit the moon, effectively defeating the Soviet Union in the Space Race. Kluger here brings the mission back to historical consciousness using the same writing toolkit that made Apollo 13--his book with Jim Lovell--such a gripping read. The main difference here is that Apollo 8, unlike Apollo 13, went quite well, robbing the Kluger of a key generator of suspense (namely, things going wrong=pages turning). Still, Apollo 8 is a good addition to the space book canon, and a fun-to-read portrait of an America about to land on the moon. "

When I was just 1 year old, these 3 men and NASA made this trip the greatest thing about 1968, culminating in the Earthrise photo and the reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve during a TV broadcast to record numbers. This extremely well-written account takes you through the training, lives and preparation of these men and also the emotional toll on their families during the long training and mission. The first to see the far side of the moon, these men shattered all previous records of how far man could go away from earth. A great story of this important mission, including a prologue of the men after the mission."

It happened to come in the mail at one of the busiest times of my life thus far. The riveting story of the men of the Apollo 8 mission and those who worked to make that mission a reality was a welcome respite from hectic times.The story starts, as it should, well before the mission itself. The story of how the men of Apollo 8 became astronauts (and the stories of Borman & Lovell's previous missions) gave context and human texture to the story. Being a space buff for my whole life, I loved reading the details of the experience of being an astronaut and bring in space.If you have a love of space and NASA history, this book is required reading."

I got caught up in the excitement that the entire nation / world had for space at that time. There is some vicarious nostalgia for a time like this when the nation could rally around scientific endeavors that pushed human's capabilities. Nowadays SpaceX can land a rocket back on earth for reuse and a majority of people don't know / care.There was a good level of technical detail in the book, but nothing that would overwhelm the average reader. The author did a good job of drumming up a bit of drama on what appeared to be a mostly perfect flight. This lack of true drama keeps the book from getting five stars. I'm sure his other book, Apollo 13, fits that bill."

My husband and I listened on a road trip and had a couple of hours left when we returned home so we sat and listened to the remainder. This version has at the end an interview with Commander Frank Borman and archival audio from the lunar orbit. I found it a great companion to the movie Apollo 13 since Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is one of the crew members on Apollo 8. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in NASA's efforts to get a man on the moon or to anyone who simply loves a great story!"

I very highly recommend this book
203,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17691396-adam-christian,5,I read EVERYTHING on the space race. I consider this audiobook a must read. Most forget or don’t know that the three men of Apollo 8 were the first humans to ever leave the bonds of Earth gravity. Completely free to the universe. This WAS the test flight. The math and piloting had to be perfect for them to return. This flight allowed 6 other Apollo flights to successfully land (12 Americans walked on the moon).Really pleased with this one and I’m hard to please. 🤔

How the Saturn V rocket produced upwards of 160,000,000 hp, and millions of lbs of thrust. The factuality is there, the tense emotions of the cold war, and a rivetting story which threads it all together. I haven't read Apollo 13 (by the same author), but I plan to now."

246,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester,3,"A faithful and fairly by-the-book recap of man's first mission to (orbit) the moon.If you're familiar with anything else even remotely in the same vein, whether The Right Stuff or the myriad of media about Apolloi 11 or Apollo 13, you pretty much know the script. Stoic military guys in exceptional circumstances tackle incredible and unprecedented engineering challenges and (for the most part) succeed.What has always drawn me to this type of story is the romance of it all. A story like this gives you the opportunity to empathize with the men who -- for the first time in human history -- came to view the Earth for the fragile sphere that it is. It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."

Mr. Kluger is a senior writer at Time and wrote several about the space program.This might be non-fiction, but the author makes this book read as if it is a novel – and an exciting, well written one at that. The author makes the story of the Apollo 8 mission not only personal, but also relevant and fresh.I’ve read many books about the space program, but Mr. Kluger managed to weave the personal stories of the astronauts (especially the Commander Frank Borman), along with technical details and geopolitical influences. Those subjects, related but difficult to explain, or weaved together in a narrative which makes sense and keeps the book interesting instead of bogged down like a technical manual or political science text book.Reading the book I felt as an intimate observer to the flight and the cockpit where the three astronauts (Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, see our home as a whole plant and observer the far side of the moon. Being in such small space with two other people, for a week, they must be compatible and flexible. There is even a section about the famous Earthrise photograph.This is a story about a technological marvel and human achievement, told from a personal, intimate point of view. Even if you know everything there is to know about the mission, I still believe it is a worthwhile, fascinating read.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"
250,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"Apollo 8 by Jeffrey Kluger is a story about the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."
251,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,5,"A very thrilling story, indeed! Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me. I listened to the audio version and the reader has the perfect voice for this kind of book - serious and no-nonsense. Bonus features include a short interview with Frank Borman and several audio clips from the Apollo 8 mission."

It traces through relevant histories for each of the three astronauts, including their previous trips to space during the Gemini missions. It also contains information about the successes and failures of the Gemini and previous Apollo missions, the knowledge of which went into designing and planning for subsequent missions.Kluger must have meticulously researched the material for this book, for it shows in the details. He's also a great storyteller and really brings the tale to life. While reading about the mission, I could almost see and feel everything as Kluger is describing them in the book. The more I read about astronauts, the more amazed I am by what they have to suffer mentally and physically, not to mention the toll it takes on their families, in order to be at the frontier of exploration and science. At its heart, this book is a tale of human triumph against overwhelming odds and obstacles, and I came away feeling inspired and optimistic."

The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "

I was so hooked up and the flow was so neat that I felt taken to those times itself. I can't wait to read Apollo 11 that later put the mankind on moon. Unlike the rudimentary surprise of me seeing the Intel 486 processors in the early 90s, what keep me even more astonished was the advancement in 1968 that pushed man into lunar gravity! Do read, you won't be disappointed."

No dry history this--Kluger doesn't just tell the story of the Apollo mission, he practically places the reader in the crash couch and makes them see, feel, experience the entire flight. (That being said, he could have glossed over the space sickness experience a bit, because ew.) "

276,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester,3,"A faithful and fairly by-the-book recap of man's first mission to (orbit) the moon.If you're familiar with anything else even remotely in the same vein, whether The Right Stuff or the myriad of media about Apolloi 11 or Apollo 13, you pretty much know the script. Stoic military guys in exceptional circumstances tackle incredible and unprecedented engineering challenges and (for the most part) succeed.What has always drawn me to this type of story is the romance of it all. A story like this gives you the opportunity to empathize with the men who -- for the first time in human history -- came to view the Earth for the fragile sphere that it is. It's a unique story.But I have to confess to being a bit bewildered about how effusive the praise is for this book. To be sure, it's an incredibly competent and thorough depiction of how the mission came together based on archival evidence and interviews with parties involved. But very little is given by way of context for the mission or what its larger meaning might have been for NASA, the United States or the world. The competition with the Soviets is mentioned and the domestic unrest of the period is alluded to, but it's strange to me that Kluger doesn't contextualize this more given five full decades of perspective.I can almost hear some readers objecting at the notion that such a momentous achievement in science and human history would be tainted by ""politicization"" or retroactive judgment that goes outside the scope of a narrow historic record. But at the same time, I think the conscious effort NOT to engage in that type of critical thinking is a statement in and of itself. Specifically, it offers the reader a license for atavism. Remember when men were men, women stayed at home and the United States was still cowing its enemies with great achievements? It's a sanitized vision of the past of the kind I remember absorbing as a child in the 90s before I grew up and started reading and realized that this notion that America was great and the world was less complicated is a trick of hindsight.I don't think this was a conscious choice necessarily. To Kluger's credit, he does mention the Tet Offensive and Soviet crackdowns in Eastern Europe, but it's treated as a separate issue from the mission itself, which is how I imagine the astronauts themselves would want it remembered. For me, in 2018, that's just not enough anymore."
277,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57986677-aimee-kearns,5,"I loved this book. It tells about all of the players in the story of Apollo 8, along with others who were a part of the space program at that time. Read this book in a couple of days."
278,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27244598-brian-moeller,5,"Jumped right into training then backpedaled out to backstory so it started slow, but really picked up about 1/4th of the way through as it got back to it. A great story of a mission I knew absolutely nothing about and the author did a great job painting it against the backdrop of the late 60s."
279,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3780991-zohar---manoflabook-com,5,"Apollo 8: The Thrilling Story of the First Mission to the Moon by Jeffrey Kluger is a non-fiction book which tells the tale of this famous and historical mission to the moon and back. Mr. Kluger is a senior writer at Time and wrote several about the space program.This might be non-fiction, but the author makes this book read as if it is a novel – and an exciting, well written one at that. The author makes the story of the Apollo 8 mission not only personal, but also relevant and fresh.I’ve read many books about the space program, but Mr. Kluger managed to weave the personal stories of the astronauts (especially the Commander Frank Borman), along with technical details and geopolitical influences. Those subjects, related but difficult to explain, or weaved together in a narrative which makes sense and keeps the book interesting instead of bogged down like a technical manual or political science text book.Reading the book I felt as an intimate observer to the flight and the cockpit where the three astronauts (Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders) became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit, see our home as a whole plant and observer the far side of the moon. Being in such small space with two other people, for a week, they must be compatible and flexible. There is even a section about the famous Earthrise photograph.This is a story about a technological marvel and human achievement, told from a personal, intimate point of view. Even if you know everything there is to know about the mission, I still believe it is a worthwhile, fascinating read.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"
280,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"Apollo 8 by Jeffrey Kluger is a story about the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. The story centers mostly on the three astronauts who served as the Apollo 8 crew: Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders, but also covers their families and the NASA technicians and engineers who made the historic journey possible. It is a bit sobering to read about the greatest minds of a generation gathering to develop 36-story, liquid-fueled, thermodynamically-propelled rockets designed to launch humans into lunar orbit in an age where our greatest achievements center around new ways to share cat videos, however. Apollo 8 is an interesting read that balances covering the technical aspects of manned lunar orbit with the personal stories of the men and women involved in the planning, development and execution of the achievement. Where Apollo 8 falls short is that it doesn't look back at the event through the eyepiece of the 21-century; it records an important historic event but doesn't provide a commentary on how these events have shaped or influenced contemporary life. Additionally, much of the story feels white-washed, particularly regarding an absence of tempers and egos from that Ghandi-esque bunch known as fighter jet test pilots and the nearly equivalent isolation and separation fears and emotions experienced by their wives and families. Apollo 8 is worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the Apollo era of space exploration."
281,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,5,"A very thrilling story, indeed! Following the disastrous Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, where three astronauts died when a fire erupted in their cabin, the American space program was determined to SAFELY beat the Soviet Union in the 'space race' to the moon. In December 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to successfully leave Earth's orbit, establish orbit with the moon (it orbited the moon 10 times), then return SAFELY to earth. (Apollo 11 was the first flight to LAND on the moon.)The narrative follows all three astronauts - Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders - although the focus is primarily on Borman. There are lots of details on his Air Force career, his family, and his role in the Gemini 7 mission... and it's pretty fascinating! The excitement that must have been felt before spaceflight became routine seems palpable in this exciting book, especially as the tension builds as each milestone falls, such as coming out of the lunar shadow for the first time and reestablishing contact with 'Houston,' for example. And the fact that the perspective of the family is included helps to emphasize the very real risks that the astronauts faced. There's no trash-talking or sour-grapes here, which was fine by me. I listened to the audio version and the reader has the perfect voice for this kind of book - serious and no-nonsense. Bonus features include a short interview with Frank Borman and several audio clips from the Apollo 8 mission."
282,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"Apollo 8 is the exhilarating tale of that momentous first mission to the moon and all that led up to it. It traces through relevant histories for each of the three astronauts, including their previous trips to space during the Gemini missions. It also contains information about the successes and failures of the Gemini and previous Apollo missions, the knowledge of which went into designing and planning for subsequent missions.Kluger must have meticulously researched the material for this book, for it shows in the details. He's also a great storyteller and really brings the tale to life. While reading about the mission, I could almost see and feel everything as Kluger is describing them in the book. The more I read about astronauts, the more amazed I am by what they have to suffer mentally and physically, not to mention the toll it takes on their families, in order to be at the frontier of exploration and science. At its heart, this book is a tale of human triumph against overwhelming odds and obstacles, and I came away feeling inspired and optimistic."
283,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11012805-brandon-gryder,5,"If I could give this book six stars, I would. The best book I've read this year. The Apollo program wrapped up before I was born, but being a space nerd I have sought out as much info on the early space program as possible. The history of NASA and the manned space program can be split into two distinct eras: the first, militaristic, Cold-War era, and the second, scientific, recent era. This book takes place firmly in the first era. We, quite literally, were fighting the Cold-War in space during the 1960's. NASA was run by mostly former military men and the astronauts were almost all military aviators. The singular goal of the space program was to beat the Russians into submission by getting to the moon first. Apollo 8 did just this. It was an absolutely amazing and dangerous mission that was undertaken by our countries most incredible scientists and fearless aviators. Highly recommended. "
284,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127161-lisa-hunt,5,"4.5 stars for this one. I am so not a science-y person, but for some reason the early Astronaut program is so intriguing to me. I think it's a combination of the time period along with the idea of something so big and exciting that the entire world was wrapped up in. This (obviously) focuses on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to the moon - orbiting it, not landing on it. There is a fair bit of backstory working up to it that was interesting. The author spends time on the families and NASA, how the pilots (astronauts) got to where they were, and the pilots themselves. At times the science got too specific for me, but someone else might be all over that. I just really enjoyed the story. This was an audiobook and the last few tracks were snippets from the actual recordings between NASA and Apollo 8, which was quite a bonus. If you like space stuff, I would definitely recommend."
285,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44757478-danny-caine,4,"Before Armstrong and Aldrin, the most famous astronauts in the world were Borman, Lovell, and Anders. If they don't ring a bell, it's because their mission, Apollo 8, has largely been overshadowed by Apollo 11. Yet Apollo 8 set many important records, including being the first mission to orbit the moon, effectively defeating the Soviet Union in the Space Race. Kluger here brings the mission back to historical consciousness using the same writing toolkit that made Apollo 13--his book with Jim Lovell--such a gripping read. The main difference here is that Apollo 8, unlike Apollo 13, went quite well, robbing the Kluger of a key generator of suspense (namely, things going wrong=pages turning). Still, Apollo 8 is a good addition to the space book canon, and a fun-to-read portrait of an America about to land on the moon. "
286,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22968631-david-webber,5,"When we left earth!-- the Apollo 8 mission was the first time mankind left the confines of earth and orbited the moon, riding the massive and dangerous Saturn V rocket and inspiring the world. When I was just 1 year old, these 3 men and NASA made this trip the greatest thing about 1968, culminating in the Earthrise photo and the reading from Genesis on Christmas Eve during a TV broadcast to record numbers. This extremely well-written account takes you through the training, lives and preparation of these men and also the emotional toll on their families during the long training and mission. The first to see the far side of the moon, these men shattered all previous records of how far man could go away from earth. A great story of this important mission, including a prologue of the men after the mission."

It happened to come in the mail at one of the busiest times of my life thus far. The riveting story of the men of the Apollo 8 mission and those who worked to make that mission a reality was a welcome respite from hectic times.The story starts, as it should, well before the mission itself. The story of how the men of Apollo 8 became astronauts (and the stories of Borman & Lovell's previous missions) gave context and human texture to the story. Being a space buff for my whole life, I loved reading the details of the experience of being an astronaut and bring in space.If you have a love of space and NASA history, this book is required reading."
288,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30597556-travis-tucker,4,"Great profile of the space race -- from the early days up to the first flight to the moon. I got caught up in the excitement that the entire nation / world had for space at that time. There is some vicarious nostalgia for a time like this when the nation could rally around scientific endeavors that pushed human's capabilities. Nowadays SpaceX can land a rocket back on earth for reuse and a majority of people don't know / care.There was a good level of technical detail in the book, but nothing that would overwhelm the average reader. The author did a good job of drumming up a bit of drama on what appeared to be a mostly perfect flight. This lack of true drama keeps the book from getting five stars. I'm sure his other book, Apollo 13, fits that bill."
289,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5904424-bambi-lee,5,"I listened to the audible version of this book, and as the title indicates....it is THRILLING! My husband and I listened on a road trip and had a couple of hours left when we returned home so we sat and listened to the remainder. This version has at the end an interview with Commander Frank Borman and archival audio from the lunar orbit. I found it a great companion to the movie Apollo 13 since Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is one of the crew members on Apollo 8. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in NASA's efforts to get a man on the moon or to anyone who simply loves a great story!"

I very highly recommend this book
293,1627798323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17691396-adam-christian,5,I read EVERYTHING on the space race. I consider this audiobook a must read. Most forget or don’t know that the three men of Apollo 8 were the first humans to ever leave the bonds of Earth gravity. Completely free to the universe. This WAS the test flight. The math and piloting had to be perfect for them to return. This flight allowed 6 other Apollo flights to successfully land (12 Americans walked on the moon).Really pleased with this one and I’m hard to please. 🤔

Things like how the Apollo 8 craft burned 60 lbs of fuel per second when using the thrusters to ""manuever around the moon"". How the Saturn V rocket produced upwards of 160,000,000 hp, and millions of lbs of thrust. The factuality is there, the tense emotions of the cold war, and a rivetting story which threads it all together. I haven't read Apollo 13 (by the same author), but I plan to now."
