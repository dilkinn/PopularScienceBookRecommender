0,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Hazen views earth’s 4.5 billion year history through his unique lens as a mineralogist. He explains how the earth was built from cosmic dust and transformed into continents, oceans, atmosphere, and life. We find out why earth was primed for life and the many ways it could have started. We learn how minerals and living organisms evolved together shaping the future of each other. This very readable book is packed with fascinating insights. Following are my notes.Hazen puts time in perspective. If on a walk every step equaled 100 years after a mile you would have travelled back 175,000 years, about the time anatomically modern humans first appeared. If you made it twenty miles that day, you would have travelled three million years into the past. At 100 years per step and twenty miles per day how long would it take to travel back to the formation of the earth? Four years! That was 4.5 billion years ago. Here we begin our story as a nebula of dust and gas form our sun and the leftovers accrete to build the planets. A nascent earth is hit by a smaller sibling, Theia, which disintegrates. Theia’s denser material is drawn into the earth and the lighter material thrust into earth orbit where it coalesces into our moon. At only 15,000 miles up (today it is 239,000 miles) the young moon appeared 16 times larger than today’s sun. A full moon illuminated the night providing more than enough light to read by. But night turned to day quickly with the earth rotating completely every five hours. The moon orbited every 84 hours. What a spectacle it would have been watching the moon go through its phases! Unfortunately the earth’s 10,000 degree molten rock surface buffeted by huge tidal waves would have made observation pretty difficult.As the earth cooled, chunks solidified based on their chemical composition, denser ones sank and lighter ones floated to the top. Within 100 million years a thin basalt crust formed floating on a molten mantle. The crust was punctuated with mega volcanoes that would build an atmosphere and oceans as carbon dioxide and water from the interior were pumped out. It’s fortunate that the atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide and perhaps methane. For the first 1.5 billion years the sun was 25% less bright than today. Without the greenhouse effect the earth might have quickly become a snowball and life may not have developed.By 200 million years granite Islands began forming in the basalt magma. Less dense than basalt, granite rose to the top poking above the crust like icebergs do in water. Water filled in over the surrounding basalt crust forming a single mega ocean. In another billion years the granite islands would grow and coalesce into the first super continent. Rain in the carbon dioxide atmosphere fell as carbonic acid breaking down rocks into clays and sending sediments into the ocean. Granite contains lots of quartz so as it weathered nice sandy beaches arose on the shores of the blue ocean. Still the land was stark and gray and devoid of life. The solar system and earth were rich in the carbon molecules required for life such as amino acids, sugars and lipids. Whether it was the nutrient rich ocean, a hot undersea vent, the sun drenched dense atmosphere or even rocks, somewhere the ingredients combined in the right way and life took off around 4 billion years ago. Predictably the author’s favorite birthplace of life is on rocks. Consider that as much as half of the biomass on earth today is found in the cracks and crevices of rocks penetrating well underground and living off minerals. Hazen uses the chirality (handedness) of amino acids and sugars to make his point. Minerals also have chirality and electric charge, another component of biologic molecules. An article published in Scientific Reports I read on phys.org on 4/4/17 as I wrote this, showed how the zinc clay sauconite can metabolize using the sun’s energy to synthesize new clay particles. Biofilms naturally stick to rocks and clays, which could have provided templates for the first life. Take a planet full of chemically diverse rocks covered with biomolecules; mix, heat and squeeze for five hundred million years. A lot can happen. Around 2.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria began producing oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis and the first Great Oxidation Event unfolded. The earth’s anoxic atmosphere would be transformed. By 2.2 billion years ago atmospheric oxygen had risen to 1%. This was enough to oxidize the iron in granite, the soil and oceans. The earth’s land surface changed from gray to red. Over the next 1.4 billion years oxygen levels would gradually increase in the atmosphere and the oceans. During that same time plate tectonics would slam granite islands together forming continents, mountains and shallow seas. A cycle of supercontinent creation and destruction would begin. Oxygen under these conditions would combine with preexisting minerals to create thousands of new minerals. Minerals evolved just as their animate offspring. Free oxygen created by photosynthesis was critical. Two-thirds of known minerals would not have existed on an earth without life including human favorites such as turquoise and malachite. From 15 minerals in the dust of the original nebula the earth now has 4,500 different minerals, our neighboring planets without life at most 1,500. Between 850 and 750 million years ago the supercontinent Rodina broke up dramatically increasing the shoreline and shallow seas setting the stage for the Second Great Oxidation Event 740 million years ago. Erosion flooded the new algal friendly coastal waters with nutrients. Oxygen producing algae thrived, setting off a cycle of extreme cold and hot periods after a billion years of stability. Reduced carbon dioxide and increased free oxygen disrupted the greenhouse atmosphere and earth turned into a snowball or perhaps just a slush ball. This killed the algae and the oxygen levels declined. Volcanoes pumped carbon dioxide back into the air melting the ice. Minerals subject to extreme weathering released large amounts of manganese, molybdenum and especially phosphorous into coastal waters resulting in massive algal blooms. After 150 million years of repeating cycles oxygen levels reached 20%. This would be the first earth where you could breathe and the first where your skin wouldn’t be quickly torched by UV rays. The degree to which methane was trapped and released as part of these cycles is uncertain, but critical to know in light of our current situation.These events led to the Cambrian explosion 540 million years ago. New multicellular life forms appeared that evolved into the diverse flora and fauna of today. The ensuing half billion years would be punctuated with calamitous extinctions caused by extreme volcanic activity and asteroid strikes. Each extinction led to new life forms filling vacated niches. 430 million years ago plants and animals conquered the land breaking up rocks and forming more mineral deposits. 300 million years ago in the Third Great Oxidation Event oxygen levels rose to 30% supporting mammoth insects such as dragon flies with two foot wing spans. Much of this was due to carbon sequestration as increasing amounts of biomass were buried, a process which had also contributed to prior atmospheric oxygen increases. The fragments from Rodina collided to form a new supercontinent Pangea. The impact formed the Appalachian mountains then as high as the Himalayas are today. 250 million years ago oxygen levels sank to 15% before eventually recovering to today’s 21%. 175 million years ago Pangea broke up forming the Atlantic Ocean. Plate tectonics would move the fragments (our continents) to their present position.250 million years from now, the continents will once again collide to form a new supercontinent. Life on earth should last another billion years perhaps two. By that time the sun, continually getting hotter, will evaporate the oceans and extinguish life on earth. We can expect ice ages to recur. We can expect many mega volcanoes and devastating asteroid impacts. Just as in past extinctions many vulnerable life forms will be lost, but others will survive and evolve just as in the past. However, humans along with many other species may not survive long enough to worry about these things. The immediate danger is human driven global warming that is proceeding at an unprecedented rate. We don’t know how it will end. There could be another calamitous extinction and we could well be casualties. But the earth and life will survive, reset and evolve as in the past.If you got this far I hope you put this well written book on your list. Hazen offers informative discussions of plate tectonics and continent formation. He details theories of the beginning of life. He explains the many ways in which minerals influenced life and in turn life influenced minerals, both working together to shape the environment. He explores the critical role of the abiotic in the ecosystem. We’re all in this together and that includes the minerals."
1,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"It is time for my sorta-yearly scientifical audiobook! Last year, kinda around this time, I was listening to A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing, which was good but quite a ways over my head technically. This time, I shifted the focus a bit closer to home and just focused on Earth, rather than the whole of universal existence. (Listen to me talking as though I plan what I read... Funny! You all know that the books choose me, right?) Anyway, this was really interesting and informative, and at times disturbing and saddening. Still technical, but not quite so mind-bogglingly technical that I feel like I missed big points. I don't know if that's because Hazen does better at explaining than Krauss, or if maybe it's just easier for me to wrap my mind around geology rather than existential physics. But what's funny is that I didn't know that I'd be learning about geological-based origin theory when I picked up this book from Audible. I just like origin stories, and I like science, even if I'm not smart enough to understand a lot of it. Plus I think the cover is pretty. Always an important consideration. So anyway, I did really enjoy this one and I learned quite a lot, both about the earth, as expected, but also about geology - a realm of science that I almost never think about. I'd always kind of thought that geology was boring... If I was a scientist who was going to stare at rocks all day, I'd want to at least see some bones in there or something. But I've been shown that rocks don't have to be boring, they can be the keys to understanding our history. Which maybe isn't quite as cool as finding bones in things, but is still pretty cool. I enjoyed how the book covered a lot of ground (heh, see what I did there?) from multiple different angles, and showed how in many different ways, the geology of the earth is central to this planet being the only one (that we know of) which sustains life. We're shown the patterns that have changed the earth over time - warming and cooling and shifting and crashing around - and how that has brought us to where we are now... and how we are affecting those changes as well. The patterns are bigger than we are - they span millions of years while most of us can barely plan for tomorrow. The earth will carry on once we're gone (for a while - until the sun dies, anyway). It doesn't need us, but we definitely need it. Mass extinctions aren't new to Earth. It just sucks that we might be listed among the participants of the next one. Anyway... I'm glad that I didn't know that this was going to be geology-centric, because I'm afraid that I might've skipped it if I had. So, if that's something you might also think - put it out of your mind. This was interesting and well written and pretty damn fascinating. I highly recommend it. "
2,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3981466-thi-t,5,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Earth history, or Earth's future. My background: I'm a 2nd year master's student in geochemistry. I've been taking geology classes for 5+ years and I've never had the story of Earth explained in such a captivating way. I'm the type of person who doesn't claim to know a subject unless I could describe its processes from the ground up, without using much jargon. That's all you get in Hazen's book. My reading pace and enthusiasm decelerated for a short while once life started popping up around p.230 , which is consistent with my rock-loving, life-ignoring geologist nature. Yet I really enjoyed Hazen's assertion that the geosphere and biosphere are intimately linked. Though I've taken my fair share of mineralogy/petrology classes, I've never heard anyone suggest that minerals were so closely related to the evolution of life. His extensive description of changes during the Boring Billion was also quite new to me, and I have come away with a new appreciation and curiosity about the ""boring"" years of Earth history (much like my fascination with the Middle/""Dark"" Ages in the history of science).This is a great read especially for a geology student, undergrad or graduate. His descriptions of still unanswered questions, proposed hypotheses, findings, etc. are concise and easily understood. The aspiring student who wishes to pursue geology in academia will find several debates that still need further research (e.g. chirality of biomolecules, abiotic methane origins, snowball vs. slushball earth). The last chapter is somber and such sentiments should sound familiar for fans of George Carlin, but it is such an important read and can really change your perspective on the climate change controversy.Readers who enjoyed this book would probably enjoy Knoll's ""Life on a Young Planet"" as well. "
3,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/977414-dr-carl-ludwig-dorsch,4," Well constructed review of consensus earth science by one practicing in the field. Embarrassingly I was halfway through “The Story of Earth” before recalling that I had only recently read Hazen’s “Genesis: The Scientific Quest for Life's Origins,” a volume covering recent experimental science in origins-of-life research, including, or rather emphasizing, Hazen’s own. While in “The Story of Earth” Hazen largely resists the technical (though, appropriately for a practitioner, he can’t resist it altogether, often again reprising his own work) enough is included to illuminate the speculation he is reporting on, and, as a working scientist his technical descriptions are plainly more credible than those found in similar general readership volumes.Hazen, by the way, is one of the authors of recent research suggesting a rather wide scale co-evolution of earth life and the ‘mineral kingdom’ (see, for instance: http://www.nature.com/news/2008/08111...), largely as the result of the “Paleoproterozoic “Great Oxidation Event” (~2.2 to 2.0 Ga [gigaannum]), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to >1% of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events [and] ultimately gave rise to multicellular life,” a topic also touched on, with modesty, in “The Story of Earth.” (Actual “Mineral evolution” paper, quoted above, from ‘American Mineralogist’ at: http://www.geo.umass.edu/petrology/Ha....)"
4,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12245412-kris-sellgren,4,"This was a fun read. The author has a talent for colorful and descriptive language that brings the science to life. I knew the broad sweep of the Earth’s history, so there were no surprises, but I enjoyed learning new details. The author’s biases show at times — he really dislikes Stanley Miller of the famous Miller-Urey experiment — but mostly he presents all the various approaches to understanding the origins of life as worthwhile and complementary. I particularly liked the experiment where someone put the contents of a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite in water and watched all the pre-biotic molecules (amino acids etc) assemble themselves into spheres with a membrane separating “inside” from “outside”. Not a cell but on the way to one. The author thinks that the hardest problem to solve in the origins of life is how chirality arose. Amino acids in meteorites are both right-handed and left-handed, but life on Earth only uses one of these. It was interesting to see a geologist’s perspective on the Sixth Extinction, caused by humans. He feels confident that some microbes will survive the worst we could do (nuclear holocaust) and life will continue and evolve no matter what. He is very philosophical about the extinction of polar bears, gorillas, and tigers (all inevitable, he says) and possibly humans. I can’t feel that level of detachment."
5,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13193102-adam-conn,4,"I never liked geology in school. Learning about rocks and how they formed was a series of exercises in memorization. It's hard to say what made me pick this book up at the library. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I did. Hazen has a way of making a topic I had always found dreadfully boring fascinating, interesting and exciting. My layman's description is the book covers a bit of astronomy, geology, oceanography, meteorology, physics, biology, and even a little history. Not too much of any one, usually never too much at one time, the science and technical details are fit within a readable narrative of the recorded and speculated history of the planet from its formation to its eventual destruction. Hazen provides descriptions of the latest experiments, theories and work being done to learn how the earth became what it is, and where it is headed. I found the part about the discovery of plate tectonics to be especially interesting. I didn't realize it was such a recent and transformative idea in the world of a science. I can't say the entire book was enthralling. There were some parts I found less interesting, or a little too geeky and technical for general reading. But this was a well written, informative and, at times, engrossing book. I am not interested in the subject, or at least didn't consider myself interested in it. But I found this book to be enjoyable and educational to read. I can only imagine how thoroughly enjoyable it might be for someone actually interested in the topic. "
6,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,4,"A very good book on the evolution of our universe, solar system and Earth.  Hazen chronologically walks the reader through 4.5 billion years of our earth's history, explaining the conditions at each stage of our planet's existence. One aspect of this book that was very appealing to me was his frequent references to current work being done by scientists who are searching for answers to geological questions still unknown.  His own theory, which he calls ""Mineral Evolution"", explains how minerals and life on earth co-evolved.  He explains that the majority of minerals existing on our planet could have only arisen due to the existence of living organisms.  Or to be more specific, the oxygen rich atmosphere and rain cycles that living beings created through photosynthesis directly led to the formation of a vast array of minerals.  He states that a rich mineralogical aspect could be used as an indicator when searching for life on other worlds. Highly recommended for those interested in geology and the evolution of our planet."
7,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"From the creation of the universe to the eventual destruction of the planet, Hazen, emphasizing the relationship between geology and biology, sets out the entire history and future of the Earth. There are some boring bits. For example, in writing about the billion years generally considered the most boring in Earth's history (the ""boring billion"") he tries to sell the reader on the idea that these years were actually quite exciting... and fails. But for the most part he succeeds in making all this science both accessible and interesting. And I also appreciated the fact that when there were theories out there that were opposed the the one he preferred, he always gave them a fair shake. Even handed and well reasoned and generally enjoyable: nice book."
8,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,3,"A fairly well-written story of the 4.4 billion-year geologic history of Earth, with a chapter also extrapolating to the future 100 years to 4 billion years. I learned a bit—lots of highlights—but less than I would have liked given the length. Too much was review. I enjoyed Hazen's emphasis on the methods by which scientists have learned the prehistory he relates, and also on the current hot topics, disagreements and open questions. Flaws: Occasionally repetitive and unnecessarily verbose. "
9,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15172375-joseph-whitt,3,"It's difficult to rate a book like this. It's not exactly a book one can ""disagree"" with, at least anyone who is not at worst an amateur geologist or other earth scientist. I enjoyed - that is to say I was interested - in the concepts of a living Earth and a geo-system that is actively and intimately involved in evolution of life. Hazen had me pegged as one of the many people who assume that these systems are relatively independent. I learned some things about plate tectonics that were new to me. The constantly moving inner Earth, something like a very slow lava lamp (actually quite literally!) also drew my attention as did the physical descriptions of our beloved Earth at its various ages. I simply wish I was able to grasp the entirety of his message but I do not think it is really possible in a single narrative, particularly of one with such an epic timeline of 4.5 billion years.Throughout the book, Hazen describes geological facts in terms of a timeline. For this reader, it became increasingly difficult to keep that timeline straight. In the first place, it's a massive timeline on a scale which the entirety of human history is but a tiny speck at the end, indistinguishable and unimportant. Secondly, 530 millions years ago sounds and feels just as remote as 350 million years ago. The numbers are just so large and the pace of reading so fast that it is no small task to process the wheres and whens of all the different ideas Hazen discusses. On that note, Hazen tends to jump to other eons and for a complete novice like me, this become confusing quickly. I effectively disregarded the detail of age and concentrated on the overall issue Hazen was attempting to explain. In this way, the book became easier to read and easier to process while maintaining the essence of Hazen's narration. I'm sure I missed some details on the way, but my sanity is still intact. Even still, I believe Hazen is a compelling and thoughtful writer. Perhaps incongruous with that though, the approach of this book was straightforward and with only a mild touch of creativity. It felt like a more approachable text book for Geology 101. Very informative, but broad in concept and delivery. In this respect, Hazen does well to make geology accessible - and interesting - to the masses.I have rated this 3-stars principally because the subject didn't hold my interest enough. This is just an issue of personal preference. There were definite moments where I was presented ideas that I never heard prior and concepts that were utterly foreign to my preconceptions to the subject. But these moments of surprise, intrigue, and awe were not the majority but were enough to fuel the engine to continue the book until the end. I imagine those more interested in geology, the Earth, or other life/earth science would be more connected to The Story of Earth. As for me, I'm glad I read it but I'm equally glad it's over."
10,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"I thought the book was well written. I know of Darwinian theory, but I have never really heard how they think the non-living earth ""evolved"". I wanted to hear the theories of how scientist think the big bang produced the 118 different elements and how they explain the formation of stars and planets from a singularity. Throughout the book, occasionally the author would mention various scientific experiments in which they'd try to replicate earlier earth environments to test out a hypothesis, this was interesting. I thought it fascinating that studying rocks from the moon, for example, discredited all the theories of how the moon formed up to that point, forcing them to make new theories. Hazen did teach me a thing or two about the realm of chemistry (which is so far beyond my comprehension) and how due to natural laws, if certain elements come together and undergo differing temperatures, change occurs as well as the emergence of novelty. But with that said, there still was plenty that struck me as ""just so"" stories. You'd think if the universe can create itself some gold, then maybe the alcomist were not so misguided in their attempts, but yeah, it is just so easily stated that exploding stars produced all the elements... ok...nice, uh... how? Is there any evidence for this other than they know this just ""had to happen""? How can any of this be verified? It seems a lot of these claims simply can't be tested.Concerning the formation of life from non-living matter, one has to love the anthropomorphic language the author used, for example he was talking about lifeless material having to ""learn"" to reproduce itself... uh...yeah. Despite his attempts to make this plausible, I thought he failed miserably. He didn't even give the slightest acknowledgement to the mind-numbing complexity of the living cell and the unfathomable amount information and how fully working living machines are required to make it all work. This section of the book was kind of like hearing a contractor say if all the building material is heaped on the ground, then it's obvious, that given enough time and tornadoes to mix it all up, it will form itself into the Taj Mahal. Not only this, but it will also learn how reproduce itself, to evolve and adapt to it's environment. For the author, its a no-brainer, merely combining the building blocks, the right environment and enough time, and astronomically complex, information rich, self-reproducing and evolving creatures will pop out from non-living material, just like babies out of a womb. If this isn't self-delusion, I dunno what is.The author did have a good imagination, the book does make for quite the story. It is fun imagining the black moon with molten lava spewing out, rapidly spinning so close to the earth that it filled the night sky. "
11,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15924623-andrew,2,"Woefully esoteric. Hazen recounts the history of Earth from a perspective one would never expect: the perspective of a dedicated and highly knowledgeable mineralogist. Hazen argues that the history of Earth, and of life, are inexorably linked to the history of mineral evolution. The evidence he provides is at times fascinating, and the beginning of the book in which Hazen describes the formation of the first elements and minerals as though it were some sort of cosmic ballet was quite immersive. Unfortunately I found the grand majority of the book--much like the evolution of our precious planet-- incredibly dull. Much of the middle of the book is bloated from long stretches of boring factoids and the occasional wholly unwelcome and rather self-serving scholarly anecdote. I would not recommend this book to the average reader or for someone with merely a passing interest in the history of Earth, which is what I had when I picked this book up. No, this book is a slog, and undoubtedly would be most appreciated by people in the field or with a dedicated interest in the finer points of carbon-dating, oxidation, mineralogy, or geology."
12,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It's a fantastic treatise that argues that minerals and rocks are an intimate part of evolution. Evolution is a fundamental process of the universe, not just in living organisms, but everywhere, at every level. We don't perceive rocks in our notion of evolution but they, just like elements evolving to become compounds and then minerals, have evolved.Rocks are an integral part of life- they came from life and became life."
13,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509692-dave-schey,5,Great and interesting read even if you have limited knowledge of geology. Hazen spends most of the book talking about the lesser-known Pre-Phanerozoic Eon (the first 4 billion years of Earths history). Fascinating read! 
14,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Wonderful, extremely detailed description of Earth's formation and the wonders hiding inside. A bit dry at times, but if you can stand that, great info."
15,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"How interesting could a history of the earth’s geology be? Well this wonderful book is a page turner. Hazen writes well and this book unfolds like a thriller. He narrates the evolution of earth from a black molten orb to the current time. His descriptive language is very evocative and carries you to these distance times, at least as our best and brightest have reconstructed it from the geological record. He steps through subsequent epochs using mineral and fossil evidence to create a fascinating story. We see the rise of life, the evolution of photosynthesis, the accumulation of oxygen, the repeated cycles of glaciations, the drifting of cratons to form continents and supercontinents and on and on. Our earth is dynamic on a LOOOONG term scale and will continue to be so. He ends with an extrapolation of future earth with some strong warnings about human induced climate change and the nature of global tipping points. This is a terrific read for scientists and laymen as well."
16,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33188041-amogh-thakur,5,"Anything less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book.Recommended for anyone with a curious bent of mind, this book is a fabulous read. It probably requires basic school level understanding of chemistry and biology to understand some concepts.The writer has explained the most complex of concepts and ideas in a very simple and lucid manner such that even the layman with basic school level education can understand them.Great read overall. Will probably read again after few months so that the concepts remain in my head forever."
17,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102754625-rob-corrigan,4,"Really fun read if you like physics, chemistry and geology!"
18,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80016449-cameron,4,This never-ending tail of a lonely little world we call home is a glimpse into our Earth's past. while this may not be the most riveting story it is very interesting to see how the Earth has evolved. I would suggest this book only to my most dedicated readers or someone with a long car ride and tons of patience. 
19,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447506-curtis-bozif,4,"Favorite parts of this book include:1. The part about abiogenesis and biogenisis and Hazen's theory that Earth's impressive array of mineral diversity is due to the life that it's supported for the past 3.5 billion years. 2. The part about the Great Oxidation Event/Catastrophe.3. The part about how the moon was formed and how its orbit around Earth used to be much, much closer. I listened to this audiobook while I was reading Alan Weisman's The World Without Us and watching the NOVA series, The Making of North America. A great triad for learning about geology and deep time and contemplating deep futures."
20,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11166290-bob-gustafson,5,"This is an excellent book. The text is true to the title. For those who are unaware, the earth is about 4.5 billion years old, so this is the entire story. It is told in a chronological format, making it easier to follow than ""Planet in a Pebble"".In the beginning, the author tells us that he is a mineralogist, i.e. at the intersection of geology and chemistry, but that the story of earth can only be told and appreciated from a panoramic view including physics, astronomy, biology, and paleontology as well. So the reader should be ready for each of these.I liked reading this book while I had Wikipedia open so that way I could read in more detail about some of the things that Hazen was writing about. If you like notes in the text, you will be disappointed. There aren't any. I didn't miss them. The book could have had a bibliography. It didn't. It still earned five stars.The other aspect of the book that I enjoyed was that there was more than one history going on at the same time. In the effort to tell the story of earth, Hazen also tells the reader how we learned the story. He tells us the historical context in which we learned about plate tectonics, about ice ages, about changing magnetic fields, etc., etc., etc.The reader should bring to the book some knowledge of chemistry, physics, geology and biology. When finished, she will be pleased with what she has learned. "
21,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601562-shawn,5," Wow! This book, written for a popular audience without talk down to them, was informative as well as interesting. Hazen draws on diverse fields such as astronomy, paleontology, and geophysics to paint a history of the planet we call home. His story telling method includes personal anecdotes smoothly transitioning into scientific evidence to bring those who might be venturing into historical geology for the first time into the fold and, eventually, along for the ride.  The only complaint I have is that the lack of illustrations of some of the topics, such as the motion of the protocontinents, would have made this book nearly a required read for any geology course. As it is, any student who had trouble finding a spark of interest in geology would be well advised to read this book to whet their appetite for a deeper understanding.  One section which was especially compelling was the section on the future of Earth. In discussing global climate change and its impact, Hazen correctly draws a distinction between saving the Earth and preserving humanity's future. The evidence he puts forth in a stark and no-nonsense manner would seem to bury any argument that humans have ""nothing to worry about."" This is the first book I have read from Hazen, but it will not be the last."

It is an interesting way to look at the minerals that make up and affect the lifespan of our world.While I have a decent basic grasp of the subjects in the book, it was very interesting to get an update on the current state of knowledge and some of the opposing theories that contest to explain areas that are less well understood."

That said I listened to this book and enjoyed it and feel like I took a way all the main parts. There was A LOT of very detailed chemistry, astronomy, and geology information in it though and there were times I got lost and had to replay sections. Few of the small details will stick with me (though I'll remember some neat new things like Uranus rolls on its side as it orbits). That said it is like a narrative science book with a lot of facts work knowing and interesting enough where I listened to the full 10 hours of it. "

Geology has uncovered so much new information about the formation of the earth and much of it is included in this book, some still theoretical. It was fascinating to see how different factors from many science disciplines interacted. If you are interested in hearing what's new in geology, this is a good place to start."

This book so exceeded my elementary knowledge of science that I re-listened to several sections, more than twice sometimes. Having loved Bryson's, ""A Brief History of Everything"" I thought I was grounded. Nope, a babe in the woods. I learned tons but lost the trail frequently. A great book on the evolution of our planet, too bad this reader needs a run at Geology for Dummies first. Read it ... twice, perhaps but dive in. It's worth it!"

36,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,5,"I really took my time with this book, and by that I mean I abandoned it for 3 months and came back to it when I failed to refresh my book selection on my phone. I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
37,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
38,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
39,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
40,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
41,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
42,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
43,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
44,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "

If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.

I loved the chapters on the early Earth, moon formation, and the last chapter on the future of Earth. I skipped around some in the middle chapters because I didn't care about all the chemistry and the minute details of rock formation. I thought the book would be lighter with more emphasis on what the world was like over time instead of how it was formed."

I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
67,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
68,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
69,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
70,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
71,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
72,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
73,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
74,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "
75,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/556514-jacek,5,One of my favorite books. Beautiful journey through the history of the Earth...I was amazed how many different stages there was in the Earth's history...Another awe was feeling of organic material ubiquity... billions of billions of organic structures - all of them trying to multiply and evolve...Though I do wish the author had more time to work a bit more on the book as some chapters are clearly more difficult while other are much easier than other. If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.
76,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3886253-carolyn-harris,3,"Interesting book, but too bogged down with science for my liking. I loved the chapters on the early Earth, moon formation, and the last chapter on the future of Earth. I skipped around some in the middle chapters because I didn't care about all the chemistry and the minute details of rock formation. I thought the book would be lighter with more emphasis on what the world was like over time instead of how it was formed."
77,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70490648-richard-pierce,5,"You don't have to be a Grad Student in Geology, Chemistry or Paleontology to enjoy this book. Being able to recall what the Periodic Tables are from your High School Chemistry class will definitely help even if it was 60 years ago. This is a very well-written and enjoyable book so long as you are not a creationist. The author makes the most complex ideas understandable. Author also does a good job of explaining how interrelated the fields of science have become. "

I found it well written and fascinating.The author takes the interesting and unique (as far as I know) angle of looking at the interconnections of the evolution of both life and minerals as a tightly couple process.

I'm no scientist, but I was intrigued and managed to follow along with this audio book narrative. What about that very first cell that split and reproduced itself? How did water get on this rock we live on? How did we go from no oxygen in the atmosphere, to enough to sustain life? It's all here, and explained very well."

83,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,3,"Hazen gives a very informative overview of earth's geological history, at least the first few billion years of it. He does, however, get far to bogged down in academic squabbles that most of us don't much care for. Overall, it feels like a book that would have benefited from co-authorship with another writer who's less bogged down in a very specific part of the science. "
84,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15455260-catlea,5,Beautiful and sobering Beautiful in the remarkable way earth's history was decoded.

I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
97,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
98,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
99,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
100,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
101,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
102,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
103,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
104,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "
105,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/556514-jacek,5,One of my favorite books. Beautiful journey through the history of the Earth...I was amazed how many different stages there was in the Earth's history...Another awe was feeling of organic material ubiquity... billions of billions of organic structures - all of them trying to multiply and evolve...Though I do wish the author had more time to work a bit more on the book as some chapters are clearly more difficult while other are much easier than other. If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.

I loved the chapters on the early Earth, moon formation, and the last chapter on the future of Earth. I skipped around some in the middle chapters because I didn't care about all the chemistry and the minute details of rock formation. I thought the book would be lighter with more emphasis on what the world was like over time instead of how it was formed."

Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. .

The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."

The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term.

I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources.

The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."

186,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,5,"I really took my time with this book, and by that I mean I abandoned it for 3 months and came back to it when I failed to refresh my book selection on my phone. I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
187,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
188,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
189,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "

I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "

The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."

216,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,5,"I really took my time with this book, and by that I mean I abandoned it for 3 months and came back to it when I failed to refresh my book selection on my phone. I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
217,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
218,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
219,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
220,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
221,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
222,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
223,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
224,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "
225,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/556514-jacek,5,One of my favorite books. Beautiful journey through the history of the Earth...I was amazed how many different stages there was in the Earth's history...Another awe was feeling of organic material ubiquity... billions of billions of organic structures - all of them trying to multiply and evolve...Though I do wish the author had more time to work a bit more on the book as some chapters are clearly more difficult while other are much easier than other. If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.
226,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3886253-carolyn-harris,3,"Interesting book, but too bogged down with science for my liking. I loved the chapters on the early Earth, moon formation, and the last chapter on the future of Earth. I skipped around some in the middle chapters because I didn't care about all the chemistry and the minute details of rock formation. I thought the book would be lighter with more emphasis on what the world was like over time instead of how it was formed."

I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
247,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
248,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
249,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
250,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
251,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
252,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
253,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
254,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "

If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.

I'm glad that I did circle back to it though because this book has proved valuable in honing my understanding of this world, of the nature of life, and of the rules governing the existence of all on this planet. I'll summarize briefly below. Hazen outlines the history of our planet using an evidence basis and working things out inductively. Much of this is likely old hat for anyone informed on geology and planetary science but it was all news to me. He discusses the formation of earth and what things were like before there was life. Hazen then outlines evidence and reasoning for an understanding of the development of earth such that the formation of complex molecules and life created the biosphere as we know it. That is to say that he explicitly states that the formation of complex molecules was an automatic pre-life chemical process that ended up creating the chemical precursors necessary for the development of rudimentary life, which then further changed the atmospheric and geological composition of the planet by evolving to exploit energy sources like solar radiation and geothermic energy and reuslting in processes like photosynthesis which created an oxygen-rich atmosphere. He states that many of the types of rock that we find are the direct results of similar biological processes, such as planet-wide blumes of rudimentary cellular life, forming a great big heaping slime, which upon extinction was stored geologically as things like limestone. One of his central ideas is the surprise awaiting fields like geology upon discovering that, far from being entirely divorced from life sciences and biological processes, were both integral to those processes and much of their work studied results of those processes. Hazen also paints a picture regarding our expectations for life on other worlds. He states that we have good reason to believe that other planets in our solar system supported similar rudimentary life to ours, based upon similar pools of evidence relating to the current state atmospherically and geologically, and that there is no reason to believe that other complex chemicals elsewhere in the universe will go through similar processes in creating life as a mechanism for more readily converting local energy sources. This is a do-read for people curious about how life began on this planet and are not sufficiently sated by ""abiogenesis"" as a one-word answer. "
277,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"After reading a previous science book written by a journalist, it was a treat to read a book written by an actual scientist again. Just for instance: I never thought about where ore minerals (like iron) come from; I had no idea that without life on Earth they wouldn't exist in that form: the Great Oxidation Event 1.8b years ago caused dissolved iron to oxidize and precipitate out of the seas. Most of the ores and minerals we rely on were laid down as a result of the biosphere's interaction with the atmosphere and oceans. As the author marvels on several occasions, minerals have long been described according to chemical structure and properties, but their origins have traditionally not been discussed.Reading about the fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 4B years is somewhat sobering: like atmospheric oxygen has ranged from 15% to 35%. Despite the long time-spans overall, there have been extremely rapid (a few decades) swings between extremely cold to extremely warm. Like when a period of global glaciation (""snowball Earth"") shut down all photosynthesis with global average temperatures of , and CO2 from volcanoes built up, and at some point the greenhouse effect took over and temperatures soared. So Earth's climate tends to exhibit relative stability until a tipping point is reached. Something to keep in mind.I learned a lot, even though I am well familiar with the broad strokes of current thinking paleontology and the history of the earth-moon system. For all of that the writing didn't seem too technical at all. Maybe I glazed a little bit in the discussion of the valence electrons of the various elements and how they form compounds.. but still. It was all good."
278,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3494440-susan,5,"This is one of the most engaging and enlightening science books I have read in recent years. I love the author's theory and research on the co-evolution of life and minerals. The biosphere and the geosphere are far more integrated than I ever appreciated, but evidently most mineralogists did not pay attention to biology or even paleontology through most of Hazen's career. This book was the first I've encountered to clearly and concisely explain the phases of Earth's development in such a way that I can begin to comprehend its chronology. What I've read before always stuck to scientific names of aeons and eras, to the point where I would be too confused to follow. Perhaps what I loved most is the humbling time scale. Human history is just the tiniest fingernail pairing in the scale of Earth's existence. Yes, we are having an impact on climate and the biosphere that may drive us and many other creatures to extinction, but we will not be able to end all life or even make a permanent mark on this ancient Earth. Earth will go on and planetary change with it. "
279,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76394518-iain-martland,4,"Just a warning that the synopsis and reviews on the back of the book are misleading as to the intended audience. The first few chapters on the creation of the universe and the formation of our solar system are spectacular. The last chapter on theories on the future of Earth are very interesting and explore just how delicate human existence on this planet could be. But the middle portion of this book is very hard going. I did well in science at School but didn’t continue the subject past A-Level (that’s 18 years old for those in the US) and my knowledge felt inadequate for large portions of the book. If you are willing to google topics as they are introduced you will definitely be able to get by, but since this is sold as a ‘popular science’ book I thought it was worth mentioning. Well worth a read if you have any interest in the topic though, and I definitely feel like a got a lot out of it. "
280,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"I cannot state how thoroughly I enjoyed this book. I have a general interest in geology and planetary science and I certainly learnt a lot of new things. Hazen not only explains all of Earth’s history, but also how we have come to know these things. Some of the terminology used probably isn’t for newbies to this topic, but you’d certainly get a sound understanding. My only main disappointment came when Hazen starts discussing the evolution of complex life. When large fungis had started to colonise the land he simply states that insects were also present before vertebrates arrived on the land. I’d have like a little more information on the beginnings of insect evolution. Non the less this is a fantastic read which lots of exceptionally interesting information. "
281,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63360490-george-f-greenwald,5,"The most compelling history of Earth. Beginning with how the planet was formed, how it probably ejected a portion of the mass to create the Moon, and how the inanimate object went through hundreds of changes over its lifetime. The book describes how land masses and oceans formed, how it went through many of its cold and warm cycles, and eventually how Oxygen formed making human and other life forms possible.I found the book to be fascinating reading from many aspects of physics, chemistry, life formation and extinction, and even how the future might probably result in the destruction of the solar system. For anyone interested in more than what is going on just in the present, including global warming, the book is too critical not to be read. I would give the book a superb rating."
282,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40487303-ken,4,"A well written explanation of why earth looks and acts like it does. A high level introduction to our geology on a gloval basis. Without the background of college level chemistr and biochemistry many years ago, a significant portion of the text would have been difficult to understand. Yet, I would recomment the book to all. Not having a basic knowledge of geology, it was fascinating to learn such things as granite is the common rock foundation on earth because it floats, that the moon was once only 55,000 miles from earth with each being a molten ball, that most of earth's menerals would not have formed without oxygenation caused by early plant life, or that ocean level variances of several hundred feet occur regularly in earth's history. . "
283,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"It's an interesting book on how the planet itself has changed over its billions of years of existence. The part I found most interesting came early on when a Mars-sized planet smacked into Earth. I'd heard the theory before, but Hazen does a good job going over the evidence for it. He argues that the rocks of earth itself have changed and evolved with life, as life causes new elements to hit the atmosphere in greater proportions, and that helps cause different minerals to form. Thus for Hazen, the ""boring billion"" years when much of the planet didn't seem to change was actually not at all boring, because so many minerals came into existence.Good book that generally held my interest."
284,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,4,"Interesting read. I learned a lot of new things about the origins of the earth (and moon). Starting at 4.5 billion years ago and moving through 5 or 6 eras I found the changes in the earth's composition fascinating. The ""life"" part is very small and the ""human"" part of that history incredibly small. The book/author sometimes gets bogged down with geology information which was pretty tough sledding for me (and I'm not sure needed for a book aimed at my type of audience). Some schematics would have been helpful for a visual person like me. Still a great read. I particularly enjoyed the look ahead - scenarios for the future- long term and short term. Definitely worth the need. "
285,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/556514-jacek,5,One of my favorite books. Beautiful journey through the history of the Earth...I was amazed how many different stages there was in the Earth's history...Another awe was feeling of organic material ubiquity... billions of billions of organic structures - all of them trying to multiply and evolve...Though I do wish the author had more time to work a bit more on the book as some chapters are clearly more difficult while other are much easier than other. If you find it too difficult - do not give up - there are easier chapters further.
286,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3886253-carolyn-harris,3,"Interesting book, but too bogged down with science for my liking. I loved the chapters on the early Earth, moon formation, and the last chapter on the future of Earth. I skipped around some in the middle chapters because I didn't care about all the chemistry and the minute details of rock formation. I thought the book would be lighter with more emphasis on what the world was like over time instead of how it was formed."
287,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70490648-richard-pierce,5,"You don't have to be a Grad Student in Geology, Chemistry or Paleontology to enjoy this book. Being able to recall what the Periodic Tables are from your High School Chemistry class will definitely help even if it was 60 years ago. This is a very well-written and enjoyable book so long as you are not a creationist. The author makes the most complex ideas understandable. Author also does a good job of explaining how interrelated the fields of science have become. "
288,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17383962-ben,5,"If you like Earth Sciences, and geology in particular, you will love this book. I found it well written and fascinating.The author takes the interesting and unique (as far as I know) angle of looking at the interconnections of the evolution of both life and minerals as a tightly couple process. Minerals provided a scaffold for life and life provided for the creation of many new mineral types. "
289,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983859-lynne,4,"This book digs right into how the earth was made at a very granular level. I'm no scientist, but I was intrigued and managed to follow along with this audio book narrative. What about that very first cell that split and reproduced itself? How did water get on this rock we live on? How did we go from no oxygen in the atmosphere, to enough to sustain life? It's all here, and explained very well."
290,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,4,A very nice overview over the history of our planet. It is rather detailed in places and I wish the author would have used graphics and/or tables (there are none) to present information. But overall a very nice book which I can recommend to the interested lay person as well as to science undergraduate students. 
291,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39390256-rebekah-byson,5,"This is a fascinating book for anyone interested in the geology, chemistry, and biology of our planet. This Earth has been changing and evolving in dramatic ways long before the first cell discovered the trick of life, and will continue to change and evolve long after humans are a distant memory in the rocks."
292,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,5,"Not condescending pop-science, which may mean overly dense for those only interested in Discovery Channel level reading. There's a really fantastic 25 hour lecture that goes well beyond what he covers in this book available through The Great Courses, that I highly recommend listening to if you enjoyed this book as much as I did. "
293,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,3,"Hazen gives a very informative overview of earth's geological history, at least the first few billion years of it. He does, however, get far to bogged down in academic squabbles that most of us don't much care for. Overall, it feels like a book that would have benefited from co-authorship with another writer who's less bogged down in a very specific part of the science. "
294,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15455260-catlea,5,Beautiful and sobering Beautiful in the remarkable way earth's history was decoded. Sobering because if we don't change our ways the millions of years it takes for a major change to happen will probably happen within the lifetime of our great grand children or maybe even earlier .
295,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24642223-joska-pista,5,"I loved this book. It is how geology should be thought. Reveals step by step how the Earth formed and evolved through physical processes. I think He raised an extremely important point, that the evolution of the geology of the Earth was strongly influence by the evolution of the biosphere (and the other way around)."
296,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76284003-lauren-farris,5,I think everyone should read this book for a better understanding of how the world works and what our actions may cause. This book is written in such a way that it is easy to understand and thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking. 
297,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39040525-dave-walker,5,Excellent book. Very well-organized and consistently interesting. Hazen's genuine fascination with the subject matter is comes through on every page. I plan on using this to significantly improve the origins unit in my high school geobiology course.
298,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27431544-mr,5,I really liked this book and I find it very interesting and useful. I definitely reread it once again and dig something more about this subject. I can recommend it to anyone who wants to find something new and solid about the planet Earth; it’s past and future secrets 
299,0670023558,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67672689-tad-sheldon,5,"A lot happened in the past 4.5 billion yearsEven if you’re not a scientist or geeky nerd, this is a great read. Many fascinating events happened in the formation of our planet in the 4.5 billion year history. This is the best synopsis of what happened I’ve read. "
