Alan Turing
 and his involvement with cracking the Enigma code during WWII (

The Imitation Game

). However, if you are interested exclusively (or even primarily) in the cryptanalytic exploits of Turing et al. at 
Bletchley Park
 then this is probably not — repeat 
not
 the Turing book for you. While 

Andrew Hodges

 thoroughly covers Turing's activities during the Second World War, this is just one piece of the whole. As one might expect of a book with an introduction by 

Douglas Hofstadter,

 it is an examination of both function and form. Alan's experiences were what they were because of who he was, and, in turn, these experiences made him into the man, the enigma he became.

The Young Turing MachineAndrew Hodges, and Henrik Olesen, the artist behind 
""Some Illustrations to the Life of Alan Turing,""
 both depict the young Alan Turing as a child inquisitive, and bright beyond his years. Alan, even in his earliest years, exhibited what Hodges refers to as a ""desert island"" mentality. If Alan had a problem, he relied on his own ingenuity to find an answer (e.g. inventing a machine to count gear revolutions and make adjustments as needed for his broken bicycle chain). 

The young genius mind, however, outside of a vacuum, does not necessarily coalesce easily with the world around it. This was certainly true of Alan's early experiences in the 
English public school
 environment.* Alan was what some might refer to as ""extremely pick-on-able."" Thus, when he received a copy of Edwin Tenney Brewster's 

Natural Wonders Every Child Should Know

 on behalf of an unnamed benefactor in 1922, Alan was undoubtedly relieved to be able to escape into a world of science, numbers and natural order. Brewster portrayed the human body as a machine; one with duties, tasks, functions, and, perhaps more importantly, one that could be understood through the faculties of reason. Obedience to Authority & The Imitation GameIn 1926, at the age of 13, Alan (left, below) was sent to the 
Sherborne School
. With an emphasis good citizenship, and the individual's duty to fit into the system of their small society for the greater good (none of which included becoming a ""man of science), Sherborne was not a good fit for Alan. 

However, things began to turn around for Alan in 1928, when he met 
Christopher Morcom.
 Morcom, one year ahead of Alan at Sherburn and a member of a different ""house,"" shared Alan's passion for science, maths, and exploration of the natural world. Unlike Alan, however, Morcom was able to integrate these interests with scholastic success.

The letters between Alan and Christopher during vacations from Sherborne are filled with an excited energy that comes with having someone with whom to share new discoveries. Christopher was both Alan's mentor and, as portrayed by Hodges, his first love. It's not clear whether this intimacy between the two was physical in nature, but the magnitude of Christopher's place in Alan's heart was made acutely and painfully clear when Christopher died suddenly of bovine tuberculosis in 1930.

The letters between Christopher Morcom's mother and Alan (a correspondence that continued for many years) reflect their shared grief in losing Christopher. The experience changed Alan in many ways, including a renewed dedication to honoring Christopher's memory by pursuing the interests they had shared (which, despite their youth, had included quantum physics, and Einstein's 

Relativity: The Special and the General Theory

). An Ordinary English Homosexual Atheist MathematicianThough, unlike Christopher, Alan did not win a scholarship to his first choice, Trinity, he was admitted and matriculated to 
King's College, Cambridge
 in 1931. Though Alan remained secluded at King's, he was well-suited to its norms. In addition to the academic caliber of his professors and classmates, it was a socially and politically liberal environment; and it was in this context, that Alan became somewhat matter-of-factly open in his homosexuality. Not knowing much about Cambridge (or really any university) in the 1940s, I was not clear as to whether Hodges' references to the life of an ""ordinary english homosexual..."" were made in jest. However, though Hodges is clear that this was not an easy life, it seems that it was much easier in the context of King's College. Decidability, Computability & the EntscheidungsproblemIt is because of my own descriptive shortcomings that I won't be saying much about the content of the foundational problems (and paradoxes) in math and logic being asked and addressed by Turing and his contemporaries in the 1920s and 1930s. Suffice it to say that if you're operating under the impression that any system of mathematical logic can be complete, consistent and decidable, you might want to take a gander at some of 

Kurt Gödel's

 early work, and Turing's 

On Computable Numbers

 (though some might direct you toward the papers of 
Alonzo Church
). Before you say, ‘well who cares?’ Let it be known that the very notion of ""computability"" (in a time when what was meant by ""computer"" is akin to what we think of as a ""writer"" - one doing the writing/one doing the computing) was new. Furthermore, this was the point at which Turing made a huge leap in the conceptual connection between 
abstract symbols and the physical world. 
  Like Schrödinger's cat, the 
Universal Turing Machine
 was a thought experiment, the elegance of which lies in its simplicity. Turing's conception (based on the idea of a typewriter) is that there is a machine that has a 
tape
, which is divided into 
squares
. Each square can bear a 
symbol.
 At a any given moment, one square is ""in the machine,"" this is the 
scanned square,
 and it bears the
 scanned symbol. 


Doesn't sound like much, I know, but here's the thing: the 
state
 of the machine (with its finite table of actions) can be determined by a singly expression using the symbols (which can be limited to two)...and there's 
recursion.
 It makes more sense if you read it from the experts! To Oz and BackIt's the mid-1930s at this point, and 
Princeton
 is a pretty happening place. Turing, offered a fellowship there, crossed the pond to work with 
John von Neumann
 (who Hodges likens to the Wizard of Oz). Things just didn't work out as planned. Princeton was the height of wealth and aristocratic excess from Turing's point of view, and Turing was proving again the difference between having brilliant ideas and impressing them on the world. However, Turing did have a good time at Princeton when taking part in ""treasure hunts"" consisting of series of encrypted clues. So, when Turing turned down a position at Princeton, and went back to Cambridge in 1938, his experiences stateside came in handy. The Enigma & Bletchley ParkPrior to Britain's declaration of war, Alan Turing was (surprisingly) the first and only mathematician recruited to work at the super secret 
Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)
, and later moved to the cryptanalytic HQ at 
Bletchley Park
. Alan, who had long dreamed of a chess-playing machine, suddenly had a practical problem for his obsession. 

“Before the war my work was in logic and my hobby was cryptanalysis, and now it is the other way round.”

 How so? Well, von Neumann's theory of 
‘minimax’
 strategies (the application of probabilities to any game between two players such that one chooses the “least bad” option) — one of making decisions in the absence of perfect information, had direct applications in strategic combat. And, of course there was decryption of Enigma messages to be done. Alan's ability (and desire) to bridge the gap between mathematics and engineering was, for the first time, seen by others as an asset. Turing's thought experiments were being translated into actual electronic machinery—
the Bombe 
(below), and 
the Colossus
. 

To be clear, it was the Bombe that was used to crack the Enigma. However, the Colossus was the first computer that approached Turing's conception of ""universality"" in that it was 
programmable
. Many of those working at Bletchley were 
Wrens
 (seen below with the Colossus), members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. For Turing this was his first contact with women, including 
Joan Clarke
. The two were briefly engaged, but this was broken off in 1941 when Turing informed Clarke of his homosexuality.

The Heart in ExileTuring had been afforded more freedom during the war than he, perhaps, realized at the time. At the 
National Physical Laboratory
 (NPL) Turing completed the design for an 
Automatic Computing Engine 
(ACE), but in the face of bureaucracy and departmental divisiveness, he had almost no control over its engineering and construction. 

 

“Alan Turing might be Valiant-for-Truth, but even he had been led into the work of deception by science, and by sex into lying to the police.”

 Outside of the cloistered world of Cambridge, England was not exactly gay-friendly (didn't Oscar Wilde get hard labor for that?). In ""exile"" in Manchester, our ordinary English homosexual atheist, when burgled by the friends of a young man he brought home, reported the larceny to the police. However, by engaging in such “sexual perversion,” Turing had placed himself outside of the protection of the law. Turing was sentenced not to prison, but 
chemical castration
 by estrogen injections. America was no better (just ask Lou Reed—his parents sent him for electroshock therapy, and that was for bisexuality). Having decided that homosexuals presented a “security risk,” Turing was banned from the United States as a whole. In a twisted, endless loop, intolerance for homosexuality put any homosexual at risk for blackmail, which, in turn, made homosexuals a security risk, thereby increasing the intolerance with which we began. On June 8th, 1954 Alan Turing was found dead in his home, lying in his bed. The identified the cause as 
cyanide poisoning,
 and the post-mortem inquest easily ruled it a suicide. In his house they found a jar of potassium cyanide, and a jam jar of cyanide solution. Next to his bed was a half-eaten apple. 

____________________________________________* For those of you who, like myself, live west of the Atlantic, ""public school"" in Britain is pretty much the opposite of what it means here (basically, it's the equivalent of the American private/boarding school...although most of us don't spend 15 years there)."
1,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"Let me introduce you to Alan. He is a quiet and shy man, but one who mainly gets along with his colleagues. He is determined to tackle large questions and finds that his understanding of mathematics and logic can be applied to aspects of the universe around him, especially in areas that people would deem too messy and without any logic. He is a great proponent of going back to first principles when approaching problems also.This book has been on my radar for years now. I found it after one of those tipping points where you finally hit the nth reference to a person or idea and you find your ignorance about it embarrassing. By the way I find that these instances only increase with the more you act upon them. Ignorance really is bliss. Anyway, along comes the film starring Sherlock himself and I found myself highly entertained by the story and wanting to know more. So it was time to tackle this volume and I chose to tackle it by audiobook.Firstly I want to cover the book and it's difference to the movie, because looking at the words on the print cover, ""The Book That Inspired the Film 'The Imitation Game'"", it leads you to a sense that a biopic from a biography should be fairly accurate. It seems that the movie took a lot of liberties and while there were not many huge outright lies, there were plenty of distortions, simplifications and exaggerations. There is a little part of me that is offended, but there is another larger part of me that is not surprised. Alan Turing was not a stereotypical genius nerd in a world that did not appreciate him. He did have a huge battle to overcome adversity due to his work being outlandish and misunderstood. It seems like Hollywood latches onto the 'Beautiful Mind' + Sheldon Cooper cookie cutter a little too much. I feel that I should also say that I did enjoy the movie. As far as movies go it was entertaining and also a bit educational. But I guess going into this book I expected a bit more continuity. Cumberbatch's Turing is not Hodge's biography Turing.Hodge's biography offers a traditional chronological look at Turing's life, from a short section on his lineage to his cremation on the last page. But there is a lot more in here than what you would bargain for. Turing's work and the work leading up it is is explained in great detail. Using the term 'in depth' may be a gross under- exaggeration. There is also a large section focused upon the laws concerning 'perversion' at the time, which Turing was convicted for. If you were to remove the sections concerning math, engineering and law you'll find a book that weighs only a small percentage of the original. I guess what I am trying to say is that this book is not for the layman. I can only imagine that there will be a lot of copies of this book abandoned on planes, trains and bookshelves because a fan of the movie picked this book up wanting to know more, just like I did. The large sections on mathematical logic I did follow the gist of somewhat, helped along by my greater understanding of maths than the average person. Large sections of this book would only be completely understandable by people with degrees in mathematics. I chose more mathematics subjects in my science degree than the norm, so I have some sense of what is going on in these passages. I pity anyone trying to make it through without some knowledge of this type of maths. If you are a person who hates 'info-dumps' you are going to loathe this book.But on the positive side, this was the right book at the right time for the right person. I have often found that there is no better way to learn about a person than to find the highest rated biography of that person on Goodreads that is at least 500 pages long. I have been stung with too many shorter biographies that leave me unsatisfied and finding out more information on the person's Wikipedia page. I wanted to know more about Turing and my god I found out a whole lot more.Of course it's not all about volume. Both the writer and narrator kept me entertained for just over 30 hours. The writer was sympathetic to his subject and yet portrayed his great failings also. I really do feel that I met a person who I can call a hero (I hate that word and I am sure that there is a far greater compliment). Turing had great determination, a high regard for the truth in his work and personal life, and a scientific approach to everything he undertook. He may be known as being a mathematician, but he was an even greater scientist who straddled fields in a time when fields were clearly defined. He often found that there was no perfect audience for his papers and that some fields would only appreciate some aspects, while other parts would not be understood at all. He was converging the sciences with mathematics.So despite all the negatives that I noted earlier, for me not only a book to be treasured, but an introduction to a man that is greatly misunderstood and hugely under-appreciated. I want a portrait of him up on my wall alongside my Darwin portrait. I am going to get my hands on some of his writing and try to get my head around more of the maths."
2,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25561549-nick-pageant,4,"This was a fascinating book. I'm not really recommending it because I thought it was overly complicated and I'm not sure that a lot of people will want to spend half of their reading time on Wikipedia the way I did. I only understood about a quarter of the many, many mathematical concepts that were discussed, at exhausting length, in the book. Still, I'm glad to know more about the man who contributed so much to computer science. He had a fascinating, tragic life. Great book, but be prepared for some headaches."
3,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,5,"I loved this book. I was almost afraid to read it after others said how difficult it was to understand the math sections, but I found those to be fascinating. If math had been taught this way in my schools, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I even read some of the maths bits to my husband!As to Turing's life, I very much enjoyed reading about that, too. I wish I had known him. The way his mind works just took my breath away. I found myself going back over paragraphs, just to make certain I would always remember his ideas, and the way he expressed them.The book covers his entire life ... birth to death ... not just the code breaking days of WWII. Not only is he considered a pioneer of computer science, and artificial intelligence, but he dabbled in physics, quantum mechanics, biology, chemistry, and neurology, too. In 1952, his work on morphogenesis became a completely new field of mathematical biology.I can certainly relate to his personality quirks. I seem to have quite a few of the same ones. Nice to know I'm in such good company. Of course, he didn't see them as 'quirks', and neither do I.As to his death, well, there has always been two schools of thought about what really happened. Either way, it was just tragic to lose his great mind, and honest heart.The amount of research the author conducted was amazing. He really worked hard to bring so many resources together for our enjoyment. Andrew wrote, ""If this book is truly a biography - a writing of life, not a collection of facts - then it is because people have been prepared to allow that interference, and to entrust me with words and ideas that still have living force."" (675)Some may find the math bits too dreary, or feel the book is too long, but I am not one of them. It changed my way of looking at certain things. It touched me on a intellectual level, and an emotional one. As I said, I loved it. If you're not 'into' math, you can skim those parts, and still enjoy the rest of Alan's interesting life.5 Stars = It made a significant impact on my heart, and/or mind. It moved me. I won't forget it."
4,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"To read this is to feel humbled, not just by Alan Turing’s brilliant mind, but also by the years of dedicated work that Andrew Hodges put into this biography. At 700-plus pages, including a massive number of footnotes and references which are themselves a fund of fascinating information, it is dense going however, and probably not for everyone, although I found it totally absorbing**. Here finally (well, not really “finally” as it was written in 1983) was someone who could explain Turing’s universal machine and his theory of computable numbers. (Not that I'm sure I understood it, but Hodges’ explanations are lucid – unlike Dyson’s muddled and waffly  Turing’s Cathedral that I once mistakenly thought was this book.) Turing was a strange, contradictory character, a shy and bumbling academic but at the same time quite unlike the academic stereotype: as a mathematician, he was so isolated from his peers that he would often formulate “new” theorems unaware that they had already been discovered; but as a result, his methods were idiosyncratic and unconventional, and often led to truly new insights. His expertise covered a huge range –everything he did had to have some practical application, yet he was the most impractical and disorganized person himself. His prime fascination was the brain - to make a mechanical model of its logical functions, and the question of whether machines could be made to think. To this end he proposed the criterion of the “imitation game”, where if one could not tell whether responses to questions were from a human or a (hidden) machine, one should consider the machine as behaving like a human. To be capable of “thinking”, however, the machine would also have to learn, independently of its programs, and Turing formulated what he considered appropriate learning schemes. But here’s the thing – he did not seem to consider the essential need of humans to communicate with each other and interact with their environment as significant to learning and development; “I think of people as pink-coloured sense data”, he said supposedly in jest, but I thought that there was a significant truth there. It all makes me wonder if Turing was not somewhere on the autistic spectrum. Although this is not something that Hodges speculates about, Turing did indeed feel his own life was something of a imitation game.He was most famous of course for his brilliant work at Bletchley during WW2 in cracking the Enigma codes, and Hodges places him very well at the centre of the decryption effort – but at the same time on the periphery, surprisingly, of the actual development of the Colossus which was the actual precursor of the computer. (This was because computers as such didn’t interest him at all; it was getting them to “think” that was the challenge). After WW2, he was involved with two projects, one was the paper design for the ACE computer, the other in programming the first actual computer (at Manchester, some time before the more famous ENIAC was completed in the US). His involvement wasn’t exactly peripheral, but he gradually lost interest in it as its limitations became apparent for the cybernetic research he wanted to perform. Turing was also a homosexual at a time when that was considered an unspeakable depravity and at best an illness. That certainly contributed to the isolation he felt for most of his life, although he wasn’t at all reticent about his orientation either – in that he was a man well before his time. It’s commonly thought that he committed suicide following a conviction for “indecent” activities, but Hodges makes it clear that the two events weren’t connected, as he had put that episode well behind him two years earlier. What Hodges does very well, in an extended analysis, is place Turing’s death in the context of Britain’s panic over blackmail, homosexuals and spies in the secret services. This was around 1953-4 when the atomic bomb was being developed, and Burgess, McLean and others had defected with both British and US secrets. Hodges doesn’t speculate on whether there was any actual government approach to Turing in that context, but it would have been clear to him that he would have been considered an even greater risk, as during the war he had been privy to the innermost secrets of both countries concerning Enigma - and compared to the atomic program (which at least was known to exist), that remained absolutely secret and unmentionable for another 20 years. So it’s likely that Turing recognized the hopeless position he was trapped in, with nobody to turn to for advice or help.I’m not summarizing this very well, but Hodges does an impassioned and admirable job. A couple of things, however, that I would knock this bio for: first, his tendency not to put rather peripheral events in context (incidents in WW2 that didn’t relate directly to Bletchley or Turing, for example). This is all a bit surprising as Hodges is not some historian assuming a bit too much inside knowledge from his audience, but a physicist and mathematician much like Turing himself. And, I have to mention Hodges’ rather outlandish overuse of allusion and metaphor, mostly from The Wizard of Oz  and  Alice in Wonderland . They can be quite obscure, as in: “Half desired, half dreaded, was the reappearance of the Monstrous Crow, currently flapping ambiguously on the other side of the Atlantic.”  or: “Yet in reaching the niente of his Sinfonia Antartica, he kept as close to his vision as the exigencies of the world allowed.”  (yes, that’s Vaughn Williams, but I’m not a lot wiser) and: “more the ITMA professor than eminent authority”  ... well, if it hadn’t been for my mother telling me about It’s That Man Again, the wartime radio program that inspired the Goon Show, I would not have had a clue what that meant. (She could do mean renderings of ITMA catch-phrases like “... he’s fallen in the waar-tah!”, by the way!)But this is really minor carping about style. And I should also say that it’s not necessary to understand any mathematics at all to read and enjoy this book; you can simply skip those details and be totally absorbed - for a very long time!_________** though do NOT read this on an e-book if you are at all like me and obsessively read every note and reference!

6,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32757587-holly-dunn,3,"That's certainly cleared up a lot of the questions I had following the film. It concerns me that Cumberbatch's Turing seemed to stray dramatically from biographical evidence. The film paints him in a dangerously stereotypical way, as the lone genius, unable to work well with others and with little care for his fellow humans. It would seem the Turing was a well-liked person, albeit one who didn't care very much what people thought of him, especially concerning his sexuality. If you saw and enjoyed the film I'd definitely recommend this book. It is a long read though, and does have a tendency to go into more technical detail that I personally found necessary. That said, I'm not exactly mathematically inclined, and these passages may be of great interest to those who understand it. There are a lot of moral and ethical questions about the powers that machines ought to have and their ability to do complex, seemingly human things such as playing chess. Hodges wrote this pre-Internet and desktop computer, so the reader has to fill in some blanks as to where Turing's work eventually led. Towards the end there is quite a bit about the attitudes towards homosexuality, especially in the post-war period, which are both absurd and incomprehensible from a twenty first century liberal viewpoint. Although we still have a long way to go, it's certainly interesting to see how much attitudes have changed. For me the human story was what kept me reading. It's a heart breaking one, with many parallels to that of Oscar Wilde, so be prepared for that. I also think that it's a story that needs to be told and shared, particularly considering that the film, while well made and emotionally charged, changes many of the facts. "
7,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"[Bettie's BooksThe shelving, status updates and star rating constitute how I felt about this book. (hide spoiler)]"
8,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983600-michael,5,"I watched The Imitation Game last week and I was left in awe, and slightly ashamed of myself for not knowing the contribution of Alan Turing to the war efforts and the advent of the computer age. After the film i bought this book and a few others in order to get to know more about the brilliant man and the code-breaking that went on during WW2. This is an extremely well-written and detailed book, and while a little heavy of the maths side there is nothing not to be expected from a biography about a genius mathematician. "
9,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.5) Quite a thorough biography, I prefer the Bletchley Park period, but quite complete picture of his lifeI only have a couple of complaints. The book is quite lengthy. I feel that some digressions into the politics at his boarding school, for example, weren't worth diving into to explain the effect it had on his presence there. Hodges also employs this extended mixed metaphor intertwining Alice in Wonderland (apropos), Wizard of Oz (less so), among others. Not sure it helped to continue referring to the Red and White Queens etc.But apart from that, this was a great read. Very full picture of Turing's life, public and private (and it was mostly private), from troubles as a schoolboy, his sexuality, his codebreaking during WWII, groundbreaking work toward modern computing, and his eventual academic fading, conviction for 'indecency' and sudden suicide.Few minor bugs, not really worth noting, though surprised they haven't been removed in subsequent editions (book was published in the eighties, right?)"
10,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,4,"Very detailed and well researched biography. Also big part is devoted to the details of specific maths projects Turing was involved in different periods of his life. The historic period background is well set out, especially in respect of gay rights or total lack of it. Only for me Alan Turing's character and motivation still remained almost total Enigma after emerging from this big book. May be it is simply impossible to ""crack"" his rich personality."
11,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/404169-traci-haley,4,"This biography was a struggle to get through. I picked it up in audiobook form in anticipation of The Imitation Game hitting theaters this fall. I didn't immediately realise how long and thorough it would be, though I knew I was venturing into a topic I knew very little about.Here's the thing -- the parts of this biography that deal with Alan Turing's personal life are EXTREMELY interesting and well researched. I loved how detailed they were and found it a fascinating portrait of a man I knew very little about. But a great deal of this biography also delved into detailed descriptions of Alan Turing's experiments and inventions, of which I understood almost nothing. I found myself glazing over for big chunks of the book while the author described the different types of codebreaking techniques. I know they were absolutely relevant, but they got so technical that someone like me, with very little ability in math or computer sciences, couldn't make heads nor tails of what was being talked about.That being said, the story of Alan Turing's life was interesting enough that I kept going through all 30+ hours of the audiobook and I *really* enjoyed the parts that I could understand. The last 3 hours of the audiobook were, in particular, heartbreaking to listen to. The way Turing was treated and the way he ended his life was a terrible, terrible tragedy. It's only a small comfort that we've made tiny strides in gay and lesbian rights -- though the fact that that topic is still a hot debate is shameful.So despite my boredom through some of this biography, I have to rate it highly because it was incredibly well-written when it came to getting a portrait of Turing's life. I am really looking forward to seeing The Imitation Game and watching this incredible life take form on the big screen."
12,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,4,"Alan Turing was a mathematician. I have a degree in mathematics. Alan Turing ran marathons. I have run three marathons. Alan Turing lived in and around Wilmslow. I grew up in Poynton, just a handful of miles from Wilmslow. Can you see where I am going with this? HOWEVER, I used my mathematics to write computer programs (and deserted that after a few years) whereas Alan Turing invented computers and computer programming. I finished my marathons in the middle of the pack whereas Alan Turing was up the front, almost appearing at the Olympic Games at one stage. There is no blue plaque in Poynton with my name on it. In short Alan Turing was a genius and I am not.I read this book partly motivated by a desire to learn more about Turing to help me understand more of Will Eaves’ book Murmur, but also because Turing has long been a hero of mine so it was a perfect opportunity to find out more. I discovered that I had known more about Turing’s life than I had thought, but less about his work. This book covers both in detail.This is a difficult book to read from a 2018 perspective. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, we take so much for granted today in the world of computing. Most of us casually carry around in our pockets more computing power than was available to the Apollo astronauts as they travelled to the moon and back and we rely on the Internet more than we probably care to admit. It is therefore sometimes hard to imagine a world in which there was not a single computer until Alan Turing invented them. The technical details of Turing’s work that are discussed are not easy to understand. I found myself scouring my brain for remnants of my maths degree and, mostly, failing to find anything helpful. The discussions of pure mathematics, logic and cryptography are complex. You have been warned!The second reason this is a difficult book to read relates to another fundamental difference between me and Alan Turing. I am heterosexual and he was homosexual. Reading from a 2018 perspective, a person’s sexual orientation would not be a big deal, but in Turing’s life time it was: if a man was caught putting his homosexual desires into practice, he was breaking the law and would be punished. As is well known, this is exactly what happened to Turing. Reading the homophobic attitudes of society and of several individuals is very uncomfortable. It is unpleasant to be reminded that my country was once like that.The book takes us from Turing’s ancestry all the way through to his death (it is still not 100% clear whether it was suicide or a careless accident). It is over 700 pages long. And yet the man himself manages to remain something of an enigma (deliberate pun).With so few messages from the unseen mind to work on, his inner code remains unbroken. According to his imitation principle, it is quite meaningless to speculate upon his unspoken thoughts. Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen. But Alan Turing could not possess the philosopher’s detachment from life. It was, as the computer might put it, the unspeakable that left him speechless.Turing was undoubtedly a genius. And his work was of major significance. The Wikipedia page for him includes the phrase…but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives. Not only did he contribute in a major way to the war effort, but he also is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.With the caveat that many pages of this book are difficult to read because of their mathematical nature, this is required reading for anyone who wants to try to understand one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century."

Good stories can tell themselves so why does Hodges have to butt in all the time with his clumsy attempts to link everything in Alan's life to childhood stories and experiences? And Turing's homosexuality, his cruel treatment by the authorities and his eventual suicide speak for themselves; they don't need page after page of Gay Lib exegesis. Less would have been more.Having got my irritation out of the way - and I was at times very irritated reading this book - I take my hat off to Hodges when it comes to explaining the mathematics and other technical stuff.

Always awkward; always shy in social situations, he grew to be ""a man with a quite powerful build, yet with with the movements of an ' undergraduate' or a 'boy', without an attractive face.A scholarship boy to a ""public (i.e., private) school"", Turing suffered the humiliations familiar (since Arnold's day) to any boy who was a loner and terrible at team sports. He hero worshiped (and more) a classmate who encouraged him to study for entrance to Cambridge; Turing, fatefully as it turned out, was admitted to Kings College, Cambridge -- his school chum having died of TB in the interim. A degree followed, where Turing produced his only real scholarly paper, ""On Computable Numbers"", where he became the first person to imagine a computer. Alan was rewarded by a Kings Fellowship and a one-year Fellowship at Princeton (amidst the great and the greater, yet, on the whole, Alan was too shy to interact with Einstein, or any of the others -- neither public school, nor Cambridge nor Princeton deflected Alan from being ""a confirmed solitary.""How much this has to do with being a homosexual is unknown--Turing was remarkably frank about disclosing that fact to his friends. In the end, it proved his undoing.In any event, the war intervened, and Alan was spirited to Bletchley Park. Although Alan had no talent for management or personnel (nor the inclination to spend any precious time on either), he did, singularly, have the ability to see the big picture when it came to the Nazi's toughest code, the Naval Enigma. That required a limited sub-set of a Universal Turing machine (capable of understanding all instructions it read), but Turing was better than anyone else. And when he thought his department wasn't getting sufficient resources, he wrote to Churchill himself to clear the blockage. So Britain wins the war--but loses the peace. The economy is in terrible shape for almost a decade; the Empire is dismembered; and Britain becomes the junior partner in the ""special relationship"" with America. Alan meanwhile, chose one of three government posts offered to build this ""electronic brain"" he promises. But he chooses poorly, and none of the three really see that it is both a mathematical as well as an engineering challenge--whereas Alan had been working with actual machinery since Bletchley Park days, and knew the two had to be combined. But his social awkwardness prevents him from making the point, and little progress is made.Alan kept to his principles throughout his life, and he became especially open about his homosexuality after the war. So much so that, when he was burglarized by the friend of a boy he'd picked up, he called the police, not realizing that as a ""sex criminal"", he was outside the law himself. The burglary was of little interest to the police, but a sex criminal with secrets was. Burgess and MacLean -- also from Kings College, and also homosexuals -- just had defected, astonishing the Brits, who had assumed the ""old school tie"" was a sufficient security check. So Turing was convicted of the unspeakable crime, and sentenced not to jail but to chemical castration via estrogen treatments. Which suppressed libido, and made him grow breasts. But Truing's treatment was a year's complete--when he committed suicide by eating a cyanide-poisoned apple at his home. Why then, his friends wondered--""his death came as a shock to those who knew him. . . The trial was two years in the past, the hormone treatments had ended a year before, and he seemed to have risen above it all.""There is no proof, but the reason is either Turing understood, or the British MI6 told him, that he could never work on important government projects anymore. ""[T]here was a solid logic to the mind of security, one that could not be expected to take an interest in notions of freedom of development. He had no right to such things, as he would be first to admit. . . [W]hen it came to questions that mattered, there was no doubt he had placedhimself under military law."" Without access to the latest information about computers, without contact with his American peers, and with probable termination of his government contracts, Alan Turing was to be placed in a position where his mind was not free to do the work he wanted. Writing to Churchill wasn't going to help this time--so suicide seemed the sole rational alternative.Hodges's book is a bit long, but likely is to be considered the definitive psychological treatment of the subject, with sufficient math to keep folks such as me interested."

I like biographies in general, but this one touched a special spot. You cannot but feel awed at the greatness of the personality that is being painted, intimidated by his genius, and infuriated at the obviously horrible treatment he received in return for saving the democratic world! Perhaps no other biography has elicited such a widely varying set of emotions such as this one and poingnantly remind us that we are just pinpoints of transient consciousness adrift in a sea of emotion.Incidentally, as a practising Buddhist, I am sometimes asked in social circles about Buddhism's position on homosexuality. And to those who understand, I tend to say that Alan Turing would have been a much happier and more productive person had he been born a Buddhist in a Buddhist culture. I wish Hodges will write a biography of another great mathematician of whom I have come to know recently, and admire, namely, G. H. Hardy. If so, I'll be the first to buy that book.If you like this book, I highly recommend you watch the British film ""Breaking the code"", in which Derek Jacobi plays Turing. I also can't wait to see the new version of it come out (apparently Leonardo Di Caprio is tipped to play Turing in it)."

Winston Churchill said WW2 would not have been won except for Turing's invention of the Enigma, a code breaking machine. His work is credited as leading to the modern personal computer. I read this in preparation for the upcoming movie The Imitation Game, and also managed to find and watch an earlier movie, Breaking the Code starring Derek Jacobi as Alan Turing, online. Turing has not been as well known as he should have been, due to the secretiveness of his work and his homosexuality which was a crime in Britain in the 1950's. The circumstances leading to his death are very tragic. The book was very heavy on cyber-cryptology and physics, and I struggled with much of it. Turing, himself, was an enigma and with a brilliant,fascinating mind. The author deserves a lot of credit for the research, but I found that for the person not versed in mathematics and physics, like myself, much of it lacked readability."
20,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim,4,"Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges is an enigma in its own right. Its subject, the British mathematical genius who contributed to the cryptanalysis of the Nazi enigma code and to the beginnings of the computer, was not an easy subject. He was a homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were considered a crime. He was a largely unhappy loner. And he was a powerful intellectual.Hodges adopts three approaches to his biography. First, he gives the facts of Turing's life as much as it was possible, for a person who largely lacked the ability to analyze his own life. Secondly -- and this takes up the majority of the book -- he follows Turing's ideas in computing and science in general. (At times, Alan Turing seems a history of Britain's contribution to the development of computing.) Finally, after Turing's suicide in 1954, he provides a long polemic about the role of gays in science in a world that was paranoiac about the Cold War and various spy scandals. Admittedly, I skipped quickly through much of the mathematical discussion, and also through the polemic coda. What held me was the character of Turing himself, his abortive attempts to break out of his loneliness -- all the while shortening the Second World War by his brilliant contributions to cryptanalysis using computer prototypes. Perhaps it is possible to write a better book about Turing, but among all the other stuff, I think Hodges did a respectable job. As a computer professional, I recognize in Alan Turing one of the great minds in at the start of my field."

I felt that I should try my best to read it before 2016 was out, so I squeezed it into my November reading.As far as biographies go, Alan Turing: The Enigma is incredibly long, running to 679 pages excluding the notes and index. The whole was not as well written as I was expecting, and it did not feel very consistent in places. The intricate mathematical details placed here and there did not always seem necessary, and it read almost like a Further Maths textbook at times. It is quite a difficult book to categorise, and it is by no means a straightforward biography, nor a critique of Turing's work. It occupies a strange middleground, which consequently means that it does not sit quite right with the reader.Turing was undoubtedly a fantastically bright man, but I thought that the telling of his story would be more compelling than it turned out to be. I do not feel as though I've learnt much more about him from this volume, sadly; Hodges' account is undoubtedly well-researched, but it is also rather disappointing."

In a man of his type, one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next.
- JAK Ferns, Turing's coronerThere have been two big films about Turing (three if you count the uselessly fictionalised Enigma (2001)). All of them are more or less dishonestly melodramatic; for instance they depict Turing's relationship with his dead love Christopher as the driver of his work on machine intelligence. And more generally they depict him as tragic. But he wasn't tragic: we were. In the 1950s we attacked a superlatively profound person, because we were certain it was the right thing to do.Hodges, whose book began the great public rehabilitation of Turing and served as the source for the films, bears no blame for this: it's one of the best biographies I've ever read (better even than Kanigel on Ramanujan and Issacson on Einstein).Begin with his achievements:

   1935: Mathematical statistics: An independent proof of the Central Limit Theorem. 
  
   1935: Group theory: An extension to a theorem of von Neumann's. 
  
   1936: Mathematical logic: One of the all-time great papers, an answer to Hilbert's halting problem and an elaboration of the incompleteness of all mathematics, and the formal statement of a single machine that can perform all computable work. 
  
   1936: Computability theory: Same paper. Creator thereof. 
  
   1936: Automata theory: Same paper. Creator thereof. 
  
   1936: Computer engineering: Same paper. Inventor of the stored-program concept, used in all computers since 1950. 
  
   1937: Group theory: Proof that general continuous groups cannot be approximated by finite groups. 
  
   1938: Mathematical logic: Invention of ordinal logics, an attempt to handle incompleteness. 
  
   1938: Analytic number theory: Algorithm (""Turing's method"") for calculating values of the zeta-function. 
  
   1938: Computer engineering and Mathematical methodology: Design of an analogue machine to approximate the zeroes of the zeta function. 
  
   1939: Cryptanalysis: developed most of the logical methods used against Nazi Germany's naval cipher, Enigma. Including a new sort of indirect frequency analysis, ""simultaneous scanning"", search trees, an independent invention of Shannon's information entropy (as ""Weight of evidence"")... 
  


   1940: Mechanical engineering: redesigned the Polish Bomba to handle the exponential explosion in the Enigma's state space. 
  
   1941: Statistics: independent invention of sequential analysis, for ""Banburismus"". 
  
   1940: Bayesian inference: independent reinvention of Bayes factors and the first approximation of what we would now call empirical Bayes estimation. IJ Good quite rightly calls Bayes factors, ""Bayes-Turing factors"". (Though it should be Laplace-Turing factors.) 
  
   1942: Cryptanalysis: A hand-method for cracking the Lorenz cipher, ""Turingery"". 
  
   1944: Crytography, audio engineering and electrical engineering: Design, proof and much of the construction of ""Delilah"", an electronic speech encipherment device. 
  
   1945-6: Algorithmics: The discovery of the stack. A neglected but vast accomplishment. (Zuse had already implemented subroutines by then.) 
  
   1945-6: Computer engineering: Design of the Automatic Computing Engine, the first complete design of a stored-program computer, including circuit diagrams, instruction set and cost estimate. (von Neumann's is incomplete.) 
   1948: Computer music: The first computer music. Turing's handbook for the Mark I had a section on using it to produce notes, and they gave a demo for radio in 1951, also a first. Not really a synth (not real-time) and not real electronic music (produced by moving parts). 
  
   1948: Linear algebra: Better ways of solving linear systems and inverting matrices. 
  
   1949: Group theory: Proof that the 'word problem' is insoluable for cancellation semigroups. Computability mainstream in mathematics by then. 
  
   1949: Formal verification: Paper on proving that computer programs will behave. 
  


   1950: Philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence: His famous one, ""Computing machinery and intelligence"" is one of the top 100 set texts in philosophy, but Computable Numbers is deeper, outlining how computability places limits on what the brain can do, and how difficult it will be to redo. He sees machine learning coming very clearly. 
  
   1951: Group theory: Another big result in the word problem for groups. (unpublished) 
   1951: Chess engine: Published the first algorithm to play a full game of chess automatically. 
  
   1952: Mathematical biology: a profound chemical theory of how life grows, now a textbook model of morphogenesis. 
  
   1952: Number theory: Numerical evidence (computed on the Manchester Baby) for thousands of values of the zeta-function. 
  
   1952: Pattern formation: Construction of the ""Swift-Hohenberg"" equation, 23 years before them.  
  

Copeland estimates that breaking U-boat Enigma saved 14 million lives, a large fraction of which we can lay at Turing's feet. This puts him in the top 50 life-savers ever. But what is most amazing (and endearing) is just how unsophisticated he was. 
 As at school, trivial examples of ‘eccentricity’ circulated in Bletchley circles. Near the beginning of June he would suffer from hay fever, which blinded him as he cycled to work, so he would use a gas mask to keep the pollen out, regardless of how he looked. The bicycle itself was unique, since it required the counting of revolutions until a certain bent spoke touched a certain link (rather like a cipher machine), when action would have to be taken to prevent the chain coming off. Alan had been delighted at having, as it were, deciphered the fault in the mechanism, which meant that he saved himself weeks of waiting for repairs, at a time when the bicycle had again become what it was when invented – the means of freedom. It also meant that no one else could ride it. He made a more explicit defence of his tea-mug (again irreplaceable, in wartime conditions) by attaching it with a combination lock to a Hut 8 radiator pipe. But it was picked, to tease him. Trousers held up by string, pyjama jacket under his sports coat – the stories, whether true or not, went the rounds. And now that he was in a position of authority, the nervousness of his manner was more open to comment. There was his voice, liable to stall in mid-sentence with a tense, high-pitched ‘Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah’ while he fished, his brain almost visibly labouring away, for the right expression, meanwhile preventing interruption. The word, when it came, might be an unexpected one, a homely analogy, slang expression, pun or wild scheme or rude suggestion accompanied with his machine-like laugh; bold but not with the coarseness of one who had seen it all and been disillusioned, but with the sharpness of one seeing it through strangely fresh eyes. ‘Schoolboyish’ was the only word they had for it. Once a personnel form came round the Huts, and some joker filled in for him, ‘Turing A.M. Age 21’, but others, including Joan, said it should be ‘Age 16’... It was demeaning, but the repetition of superficial anecdotes about his usually quite sensible solutions to life’s small challenges served the useful purpose of deflecting attention away from the more dangerous and difficult questions about what an Alan Turing might think about the world in which he lived. English ‘eccentricity’ served as a safety valve for those who doubted the general rules of society. More sensitive people at Bletchley were aware of layers of introspection and subtlety of manner that lay beneath the occasional funny stories. But perhaps he himself welcomed the chortling over his habits, which created a line of defence for himself, without a loss of integrity. 
We have words for this now (""nerd"", ""wonk"", ""aspie""), and massive institutions, and even social movements, but at the time he had to make do with ""don"", and hide inside academia. Again: the problem wasn't him, it was us. He gets called a mathematician most often, I suppose because people don't want to be anachronistic. But scroll up: his most famous work is as a logician and a systems architect, and much of the rest is statistics and algorithmics and cognitive science. He was falling between several chairs, until computer science caught up with him:
a pure mathematician worked in a symbolic world and not with things. The machine seemed to be a contradiction... For Alan Turing personally, the machine was a symptom of something that could not be answered by mathematics alone. He was working within the central problems of classical number theory, and making a contribution to it, but this was not enough. The Turing machine, and the ordinal logics, formalising the workings of the mind; Wittgenstein’s enquiries; the electric multiplier and now this concatenation of gear wheels – they all spoke of making some connection between the abstract and the physical. It was not science, not ‘applied mathematics’, but a sort of applied logic, something that had no name. 
The philosopher-engineer. One of several moments in Hodge's book that left me dumbstruck is Turing arguing with Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. (In the spring of 1939 they were both teaching courses at Cambridge called that!) Bit awkward, and in my view Alan goes easy on Ludwig. But you still couldn't make it up.The government employed Turing for 9 years, paying him about £6000 over the duration (£150k in today's money). In that time he produced 3 gigantically advanced systems (most of the Hut 8 system, the Delilah and the ACE design), about 10 or 20 years ahead of their time. Hodges sees this as a triumph of managerial socialism. Now, breaking naval enigma for £6k is an unbelievable deal (the savings from undestroyed shipping and cargo would be in the billions). But the government suppressed Delilah and totally screwed up the ACE project. So I'm not sure if we can cheer too much. Keynes says somewhere that
The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.
This is true of Enigma, I suppose. But instructive failures are only helpful if they occur in public. (As at least the ACE report was.)The most annoying part of the films making up emotionally powerful unifying themes for Turing is that they are already there. (But to grasp them, you'd have to actually display what was most wonderful and important about him, his technical work, and there goes the box office.) Anyway, here's one that made me cry:
In an end-of-term sing-song [at Sherborne, when Turing was 12], the following couplet described him: Turing’s fond of the football fieldFor geometric problems the touch-lines yield... another verse had him ‘watching the daisies grow’ during hockey... although intended as a joke against his dreamy passivity, there might have been a truth in the observation.[20 years later] ...One day he and Joan were lying on the Bletchley lawn looking at the daisies... Alan produced a fir cone from his pocket, on which the Fibonacci numbers could be traced rather clearly, but the same idea could also be taken to apply to the florets of the daisy flower.[30 years later] ...he was trying out on the computer the solution of the very difficult differential equations that arose when [one] followed the chemical theory of [plant] morphogenesis beyond the moment of budding... it also required some rather sophisticated applied mathematics, which involved the use of ‘operators’ rather as in quantum mechanics. Numerical analysis was also important... In this it was like a private atomic bomb, the computer in both cases following the development of interacting fluid waves....he also developed a purely descriptive theory of leaf-arrangement... using matrices to represent the winding of spirals of leaves or seeds round a stem or flower-head... The intention was that ultimately these two approaches would join up when he found a system of equations that would generate the Fibonacci patterns expressed by his matrices....Such observations reflected an insight gained from... [a program called] ‘Outline of Development of the Daisy’. He had quite literally been ‘watching the daisies grow’... on his universal machine.

27,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15175190-nicholas-spies,4,"I found Alan Turing the enigma by Andrew Hoges quite interesting and maddening. Interesting because of the genius and achievements of Turning, which are described in some detail (much to the author's credit) but maddening because of the sociopolitical asides about Turing's homosexuality (which was illegal in the UK during his lifetime), not just as they relate to Turing himself but to further an agenda of the author that detracts from Turing's story. I say this despite the evidence that homophobia drove Turning to commit suicide, because the author's preoccupation with gay rights is sadly far out of proportion to what Turing deserved, and largely beside the point as well.What follows is largely personal opinion about the Turing Test, which I feel has created a rather trivialized notion of what constitutes computer intelligence.In a famous article for the magazine Mind circa 1950, Turning proposed what has ever since been called the Turing Test, to determine when or whether the point has been reached that a computer could be considered 'intelligent'. In a Gedankenexperiment a computer and a reasonably knowledgeable person are placed in separated rooms, but are allowed to communicate to one another via teletype. Turing reasoned that if the human (or the majority of a series of humans) could not determine whether the computer was merely a machine or was a human, then it would be reasonable to call that computer 'intelligent'. Another way of putting this is this: If a computer could plausibly field any series of questions put to it by a human, such that the human has no reason to believe that his or her counterpart was a machine, than the machine could be considered 'intelligent'. I shall return to this later.Turing's brilliant work in the 1930s (some in conjunction with Alonzo Church) and, in particular, his invention of Turing Machines, a conceptual machine that he proved would be capable of performing any calculation that any computer could do established that computing machines were indeed mathematically viable. And, indeed, a Turing Machine can be used to determine whether some problems are computable at all, or would take an inordinate amount of time to solve, and whether the computation process ever ends (the last is called ""The Halting Problem"").This conceptual machine consisted simply of a paper tape of infinite length to the left and right of a read/print head. Using a character set of only two or three symbols (e.g. space, 0 and 1) the read/print head could, much like a typewriter, be advanced or moved back a space at a time, could optionally print a character, but, unlike a typewrite, could also read the character under it or erase or replace it.The way a Turing Machine is programmed is with a ""state table"". A state table can be expressed by a table or graph, which, mathematically speaking, consists of nodes and directed edges. In English, a node is drawn as a circle, perhaps identified with a label (e.g. A,B,..,etc) and represents a ""state"" (used in the sense of ""a state of action""). Directed edges are simply lines terminated by arrows that indicate their direction. The edges point to and connect different nodes or arch back to connect a node to itself.Each node represents an action taken by the head, and each node represents what state to move to when a space or 0 or 1 are encountered by the read/print head. [This is the simplest explanation of what are in fact a whole family of state machines with still more functions.]It is nearly impossible to conceive that any algorithmic computation done by a computer can be done by a Turing Machine, but I believe that this is undisputed (possibly excepting computations that might be done on a quantum computing machine).The other basis for Turing's well-deserved fame is that he was the principle designer of the ""Blechley Bombe"", aided by many others, which famously broke the Enigma code of the Luftwaffe, which gave such an edge to the RAF in the Battle of Briton it might be said to have been critical to the outcome of World War II. However, this was a tightly held secret until until many years after the War, and lead to many revisions of the history of WWII, not to mention augmenting Turing's reputation.Although many take the Turing Test as the gold standard for determining whether a computer is 'intelligent', I feel it is a flawed argument. I feel that the output of a computer (such as Deep Blue defeating Gary Kasparov or IBM's successful assault on the quiz show Jeopardy) although perhaps wondrous or exciting, proves nothing about it's intelligence. I feel that a valid version of the Turning Test would be if humans could not determine whether or not a computer is a machine or person, but only if the computer programmed itself by its own volition>. Only then could it be truthfully said that the computer was equal to human intelligence."
28,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,4,"This comprehensive biography is certainly detailed. It is, perhaps, the most thorough biography I've read. This allows a great insight into the character and intelligence of Turing, but it did quickly become unnecessarily dense in parts, and felt like it was veering off at a tangent by placing Turing's academic work in a wider context than was really necessary. I don't think the book needed to explain some of the mathematical concepts in quite the detail it did, nor did it need to explain in fine detail the sequelae of those concepts as discovered by others.I was also a little uncomfortable with the degree of subjectiveness in this description of his life. Clearly, it is impossible for any biography to be written from a totally objective stand-point, but it is clear that Hodges stands in awe of Turing, and constantly tries to explain and justify anything that could be seen as a fault in him. There were times when motives and opinions seemed to have been assigned to Turing's actions without a clear explanation given as to how Hodges had derived these, which made me question their veracity. I'm also awed of Turing and think he's a giant of our age, but even I found the warmth, bordering on sycophancy, of this book a little overbearing. I think the point would have actually been made more strongly had the reader been left to draw their own conclusions from a more objective description of the events.I was disappointed with some of the omissions of this book. Turing was clearly a man with a strong sense of morality and ethics, and yet cryptography - perhaps his best-known skill - has inherent within it the ethical complexity of choosing when to act on intelligence, and when to ignore it and effectively sacrifice people in order to maintain the illusion that the code has not been broken. This, to me, is one of the most profoundly interesting parts of the work completed at Bletchley, and of cryptography, yet this is given relatively short shrift in this biography. I feel sure that Turing would have reflected on this point, and probably had interesting things to say about it, so it seems a shame that they aren't discussed here. Perhaps this reflects a wider criticism of the book - it's difficult at times to pick out Turing's character amongst the reams of detailed mathematical and computational theory. That said, I think the story and an impression of the character of Turing does manage to shine through over the course of the book as a whole, even if it is hard-going in parts."
29,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,4,"In the mid-1940s, America worked on ENIAC while in Britain Turing worked on his own ""universal Turing machine"" and had been since at least 1936. Turing insisted the software was the main thing, the most important area of development, but in America the main focus was on building bigger hardware. Yes, programming was the most important part of what the future held for technological progress, but the world decides to ""deprogram"" Turing when a court finds him guilty of homosexual acts: instead of prison, Turing chooses chemical treatments for himself so that he can keep working, keep contributing. (Cambridge University stood behind Turing, they knew they had a genius on their hands.) But Turing sees the future and he knows that the government could continue to bring cases against him, as there was a rise in Britain to completely eliminate this ""social problem"". (The world simply didn't learn a thing from Hitler!) Thus, Turing ends his own life, ironically with a poisoned apple. There are many big ideas here: how math and science and quantum physics impacted Turing, and how Turing used these elements to advance his own knowledge. There are some challenging passages, and some seem to digress from the actual story. It's as if Hodges refused to eliminate any elements of his exhaustive research, in effect ""strutting his stuff"". And I particularly did not like the author referring to Turing as the Dorothy character from The Wizard of Oz. ""Dorothy"" is a derogatory term within some gay communities, as in, ""Come on Dorothy, get away from the mirror."" This Wizard/Dorothy metaphor (used at least twice by the author) is senseless. So I give Alan Turing himself five stars: his genius certainly saved many lives during WW2, and never once during his trials did he mention what he had done for Britain: this is a man who keeps his promises, he'd vowed never to talk of his decryption work. But three stars to the author, whose digressive passages did not add anything to the book and his metaphors (Dorothy, as mentioned above, plus continual ""White Queen/Red Queen, etc.) were pointless and distracting. The author seems to forget at times that this is Turing's story, not Hodges'. Thus, my four-star rating. A good editor could have whittled away at least 100 pages from the edition I read with 679 pages. I enjoyed this, but I won't read it again, and even though the movie has some historical inaccuracies, I think for most people the movie is a fine and heroic rendering of Turing. "
30,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"This biography of Turing, that eventually spawned the recent biopic The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch, is a solid read and in some ways better than the movie.The book focuses on more than just Turing's contributions around cracking the Enigma Code which is interesting in and of itself. As discussed in the book Turing made major contributions in bringing about the computer revolution, is called by some the father of modern computing, and played a vital role in advancing the theory of artificial intelligence which is what he was working on when he died in 1954. The book does not shy away from his homosexuality. However the homosexual acts that led to his downfall are only 15% of the book. I think the movie, perhaps justifiably, over-emphasized the homosexual events but at the same time the movie did Turing a disservice by creating the impression that Turing was autistic, lacked humor and any emotional maturity. From reading the book this view appears to be fabricated or at least significantly embellished. There are enough letters from Turing's own writings and sources quoted in the book that speak to the contrary. I think the book also does a good job describing in tech speak many of Turing's mathematical insights and breakthroughs, mostly in layman's terms. With that said the writing in this bio is a little choppy at times. In closing it is difficult to think of a 20th century scientist or mathematician who contributed more to the world than Alam Turing and that includes Einstein. For that reason alone this book is a must read."
31,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,3,"Alan Turing has always been a fun historical figure. The Turing Test and Turing Machines are both tributes to his unending contribution to the world of science fiction. I mean science and mathematics. The real stuff, not books about robots at all. But he was, apparently, a great deal more than that. He was instrumental in decoding Enigma messages during WWII. He was a grumpy puppy who didn't socialize well. He was a gay man alienated from society by early twentieth century mores. He helped build one of Britain's first computers. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire. He was prosecuted as a sex criminal and dosed with hormones that made him grow breasts. He killed himself with a poison apple. Hodges does a brilliant job of exploring Turing for the man that he was as well as his many accomplishments. It was a beautiful book. "
32,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17865629-mary-whisner,4,"Fascinating but overly detailed in stretches. Sometimes I just don't care that Turing had a meeting with so-and-so about a particular project. But, that said, there really were a lot of interesting themes: math, philosophy, technology, war, homosexuality.The author uses many literary allusions, sometimes to excess. There are a lot of Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking-Glass references (science and Jabberwocky, the Cold War and the Red Queen). Also references to George Bernard Shaw's Back to Methuselah and some E.M. Forster and George Orwell and Oscar Wilde and even a little John Stuart Mill. It kept me on my toes, except when it went over my head. I liked it a lot. I think I might have liked it at least as much and maybe more if it had been about a third shorter."

35,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,3,"I am really glad I read this book. I read it for the story of the person - the biography. The writing was well done. It is hard to write a story that contains a lot of technical detail. This was managed quite well. My problem was that I couldn't relate to the technical stuff in audio form. I have resigned myself to the fact that for me, technical stuff has to be presented in a visual form. I simply can't handle techical material in audio form while commuting to work. Also, I don't really have the background for understanding all the detail. However, it was rather clearly presented and I could follow along. I confess that I rather zoned out some of those parts and therefore gave a lower rating. Knowing that I was completely mesmerised by the Ramanujan story in ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"", which I read in print, I might well give this a higher rating if I had read an ebook or paperback.All in all, it was nice to get an in-depth peek at this person before I see what Hollywood makes of him in ""The Imitation Game"". I already have my suspicions of how the film will be lacking. It might well be a good film, but won't be able to convey the details about his upbringing, the times he lived in, and so on, and which shaped him in so many ways, for better and for worse. I do wonder how Alan Turing would have turned out if he had been born in 1962 instead of 1912. He seemed to have been very much his own person despite the way society was constructed in his day. Today, that independence might have been given much more support, and of course, his lifestyle would have been supported. How would he have developed and would he have lived a much longer life?I am about to write something that I do not think is a spoiler. This is a biography, and if you are at all curious about the book, you should know a bit about his death.As I read about his death, I thought the author was leaning toward accidental death. He even seemed to build a case for an accident. Then he goes the other way and indicates all the ways in which there was no support for Alan in the world in which he lived. Before reading this book, I only knew that he had committed suicide. Period. However, I am left in a bit of confusion. I now have the impression that an accident seems to be the most logical conclusion. True, conditions for living as a homosexual in his day were close to impossible, but they didn't appear to be causing him to think of killing himself from the tales given here. All along, I get the impression of an inquisitive mind who explores in all directions quite eagerly. He could have easily gotten careless and had an accident. A suicide is tragic. An accidental death is also tragic. This was obviously a great mind who achieved great things in his lifetime. I am glad I got a little glimpse into it through this one author's interpretation.A recent newspaper article gives me the impression a new biography is coming out soon. I remember hearing about it because that author said that the idea of Turing having autism is hogwash. Well, this author gave me the strong impression that Turing could have had Asperger's. And so what. It's neither here nor there, but it does clarify his behaviour in some social settings. That's all. It's nothing to be ashamed of, but the article (I cannot remember where I saw it) indicated that this other author felt negative about the idea.I can see that this is a rambling review, but hey, it's a biography. I can share my reactions to the book in a rambling way if I want to! :)"
36,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73677090-h-vinh,3,"If one arouses interest in reading this book by simply from the blockbuster movie The Imitation Game(2014) then I must warn to lower your expectation. This book is an intensive bibliography of the so-called godfather of the modern computer, who set the foundation in materializing the idea of a universal machine that can automate any task, rather than only mathematical operations such as multiplication and addition, into a physical entity. It shows what makes him a great person is his dedication to achieve this dream, since it surely does take a lot of effort for a mathematician to step out of his comfort zone, into the world of engineering.As the old saying: ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"", Alan Turing's work takes over from the previous laborious discovery of his colleagues, and levers it to a new abstract idea. Its impact lies on the idea of representing any problem in binary format, and hence so long as one can transform an instruction in this form, the computer can automate it at ease. Furthermore, his experience at Bletchley Park familiarises him with Electrical Engineering and powers him to readily attack the biggest challenge himself.The book contains all the required materials to make a big hit: Alan's inner struggle in dealing with his homosexuality throughout letters to his mom and friends; the ingenious idea in capturing the fatal weakness of the Enigma; or his suicidal thought of lacking recognition from the Computable Number work, etc. However, what was shown in the movie is sole accounts for 1/3 or 1/4 of the content of the book. The author does not frame it to be a masterpiece that one day to be made to the cinema, instead, he wants to give Alan the full credits for all his works as it should be. Sadly, for a common reader to fully appreciate the book, he must has a substantial knowledge in three aspects: Mathematics, Electrical Engineering and History (not to mention Computer Science). This is a massive trade-off for the reader.At the time this review is written, I'm reading halfway through the Chapter 6/8 - Mercury Delayed, and decides that this book is not for me. I may attempt to reread it in the future, but that's not gonna happen in anytime soon."
37,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"This is the book upon which the movie ""The Imitation Game"" was based. It is a detailed biography of Alan Turing. Turing's story is well known from histories of his role in code breaking in WW2 as well as in histories of computers and technology, most recently in Walter Isaacson's new book. I wanted to read the book because the movie struck me as presenting a simplified and even distorted view of Turing's life. I can understand the choices the director made and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I am glad they made the movie and a thorough discussion of Turing's accomplishments would not have a place in a movie that could reach a mass audience.Hodges has written an excellent book. It really helps that he is fascinated by the technical details of Turing's work and is skilled at explaining them. (If you don't believe me, trying reading some of his papers and consider what the movie version would look like.) Much in the book does not make it into the movie, however. For example, while he was arrested and convicted of homosexuality in 1952, little of the details of his secrets are even alluded to in the movie. In a sense, this bio reminds me of ""A Beautiful Mind"", the bio of John Nash. Both books were excellent and both were made into movies that presented different view of their subjects than were to be found in the original books.Turing's contributions to breaking the Enigma codes in WW2 would qualify him for greatness had he done nothing else. But Turning was also one of the intellectual fathers of modern computing and played a major role in the development of the computer in Britain following the war. Issues related to the ""Turing Test"" and to ""Turing Machines"" are still discussed across college compuses and in technology parks. And all this was done before he turned 40. Hodges books is not the only popular book to consider Turing's life, but it is an effective biography that does a fine job at presenting a complex life."

I expected the usual: quick facts about Turing, the main events surrounding his life, a tiny bit about his work (he was a mathematician, after all, so I was prepared for hand-waving and simplifications) and maybe a short analysis of his legacy.What I found, instead, was a highly detailed analysis of the man, putting everything in its proper historical context, giving gossip, and answering every single possible question I had or could have had. The solving of the Enigma Machine was carefully explained, starting from the advances of the Polish cryptographers, the dead ends they found and the breakthroughs they managed, and without sacrificing much rigour. Of course, this wealth of information can be too much at some points: personally, I found myself drowning in it during the development of the first computers. However, this was mainly because the topic at hand wasn’t really my cup of tea. Some other reader could’ve felt the same when the author treats, for example, the view of homosexuality in the scientific community at the time, or the details surrounding Turing’s thesis, while those very details were what made the biography outstanding to my eyes. Because of this, even though some parts were a bit too much for me, I am very thankful for their existence.But, of course, the book isn’t just facts. Alan Turing was a brilliant figure, whose whole personality and character, as well as the many aspects of his life that couldn’t be considered but adventures, capture the reader in an unexpected way. I was surprised upon finding myself crying over a biography.In summary, it is a very complete book: thrilling, informative, emotional, strong. Every reader could find something for themself in it, as long as they keep in mind that it is not really a light read"

They wanted to make a movie for smart people, treating the audience as intelligent people. December 2014, original commentsA long book about a scientific mind, a math genius who helped save the world from the thugs and bullies of World War II. Intriguing detail about code-cracking in the early forties, the most exciting part of the book. Turing died in the fifties. In the sixties, 2001: A Space Odyssey based HAL on Turing's ideas. Thirty-two pages of notes. Three and a half stars.This is another backstory to the period, which joins other recent book-to-film translations, including The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History.Good film. Cracking the Enigma code of Germany cut the war by two years and saved fourteen million lives. Churchill regarded Turing as making the greatest single contribution to winning the war. … But seeing the film before reading the book took the risk of learning the story as a two-hour cinema rather than as the proper written tale that stretched out seven hundred pages for the correct details, nuance and perspective."
40,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9734064-smith,2,"Details of Turing's life and his mathematical reasoning were interesting and the author did a nice job laying out the details (perhaps could've used more diagrams later on, but generally quite good). Unlike some biographies, it feels like significant effort was applied to form and writing style. Unfortunately, this is to the book's detriment-- the author would have done better to just be direct. I would've found enough depth and interest in the subject itself without having to wade through a thicket of metaphors and far-flung allusions. It would be one thing if the recurring imagery (Red Queen, White Queen, Dorothy) coalesced into some kind of meaningful theme, but often it feels that the author is throwing them in at random to spice things up. The effect is pedantic and needlessly confusing. Moreover, the last chapter is kind of a mess-- without the chronological structure of Turing's life on which to base the narrative, the story flaps around, cycling between weak suggestions of motive for Turing's death, the fate of the pertinent computers, future treatment of homosexual people in British society, and back again.For those faults I found Alan Turing: The Enigma to be a merely 'okay' read. However, I understand that writing is not the focus of most biographies. Credit where credit is due, Hodges does justice to both math and man, and beneath the thicket lies a story that is both comprehensive and interesting."

Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't even finish this book; which doesn't happen often for me. This is one of those few times where the movie is FAR better than the book. I heard there is an abridged version; maybe I should have tried reading that book instead.This book was not about Alan Turing's life. This book was about dissecting the education and learning and accomplishments of Alan Turing. The first 120 pages I dutifully read every word, though I kept getting lost during the math and science break-downs. Then I started skimming; trying to pick up on the parts of the book that focused on him as a person and what his life was like. But the author wove Alan's work so tightly into the story that it became impossible to separate the two. I made it about half way through the story and gave up when I realized I was flipping pages instead of reading pages. I found very little about Alan as a person in this story which is ultimately the reason I gave up.I'll have to do a little research and find a better author that captures Alan's life in a way I can understand and read.

World war 2, math, Benedict Cumberbatch, AND it was based on a true story? My favourites. I ordered the book almost immediately after I got back from the theatre. While the movie focused on his work at Bletchley park during the war (which was definitely awesome), I didn't realize how important his other work was. In fact, as someone reasonably familiar with both WW2 and computers, I'd never even heard of him. His ideas were well beyond his time. While other people during that time period were trying to build machines to do calculations and and solve practical problems, Alan Turing wanted a machine that could think. His work is the basis of most modern computers as well as artificial intelligence. I loved that the book included many of his eccentricities, such as wearing a gas mask while bike riding during certain times of the year because he had allergies. Some of the math and physics was a bit over my head, but overall it was well explained. An interesting book about an even more interesting man."

Don't pick it up expecting true insight into its subject - although the biographer himself admits a lot of source material has been lost or destroyed over the years, especially Turing's personal papers mentioning his personal life - as it dwells upon his scientific accomplishments. That's all well and good if you were reading a text for a uni course on crypto graphics or early computer studies, but when you want to read about the person you will be disappointed. Much of the last year of Turing's life is glossed over in one sentence, ""a year later, he was dead"". What? There is nothing to tell us about that year? We race ahead to the suicide, and after many many dry pages of theory interspersed with one about Turing the man, I cannot help but feel flummoxed."

Four years he famously designed the 'bombe' machine which enabled his Hut 8 at Bletchley Park to break the German Naval Enigma and turn the Battle of the Atlantic in favour of the Allies. Turing had poor management and political skills and after 1943 found himself somewhat thwarted in development of computing but by 1946 he had effectively designed the first computer programming. He committed suicide in 1954, two years after a gross indecency conviction for admitted homosexual activity. A great but ultimately sad book."
53,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4927816-clare,4,"I listened to the audiobook of the book. It had been recommended repeatedly in interviews about the forthcoming movie ""The Imitation Game"" about Alan Turing, and I thought I'd give it a try. I usually try to read the book before significant films I'm really looking forward to--particularly when they're about people that I greatly admire.I've admired Mr Turing from around the same time I read about who Admiral Grace Hopper was. Both were minorities who made exceptional contributions to what we now call the computer-a female and a homosexual in a time when male heterosexuals ruled the workforce. They both seemed like people that not enough people knew the names of. We hear the names ""Newton"" and ""Edison"" and...heck, even ""Bill Gates"" and ""Steve Jobs"" but back before computers were a ""thing"" there was Alan Turing who had the idea of creating a ""Universal machine"" that could do any job--all you would have to do would be to change the information fed into its memory. And Grace Hopper who created computer programming which has progressed into software and now...apps.So-- the book..was written by a mathematician about a mathematician...and he chose to tell Alan Turing's life almost entirely in terms of what his intellectual life was at the time. I became exceptionally glad I was listening to an audiobook because I could just let my eyes glaze over during long bits of recitation of how he wrote papers on ......blah and blah...because I had no idea what that meant, honestly...and just wait until I hit on areas I did understand. There are bits of the book where the author describes papers and ideas that Alan Turing had that were astoundingly prescient about what computers would be like in the future- about them being smaller, portable, able to process much more quickly-- and even--as he famously wrote about in his paper ""The Imitation Game""--being able to mimic human behaviour well enough to be mistaken as human. I found the *man*, Alan Turing, fascinating. I really would like to read a book about him that delves more into how he thought--that doesn't just express those thoughts in formulae. (It wasn't that extreme but the writing felt uncomfortably similar to writing in scientific journals at times and it was *not*. ) I think this book would have been better served if it had been published with much of the more technical writing as appendices, wherein the author could write up a summary of what essentially happened--in ENGLISH for non-Mathematicians-and then those who ARE Mathematicians (or Computer Science professionals, or whatever other technical field might want the nitty-gritty details) could go to the appendices to read those details at length. I do understand that the author would feel it necessary to make these details available for those who are professionals, but if he had done it in the way I've suggested, it would have allowed those of us who have come to the work merely to learn about the man--what was his background, what did he do, what was done to him, etc...? --then those persons would also be served. Perhaps you might consider this in a future edition.Like other commenters... I don't really know how to mark this. I don't really want to mark it down because it's exceptionally well researched, and there are miles and miles of technical data spelled out in the work--the book *is* very complete. However, it is also a very difficult read because of this. If I had been reading this rather than listening to an audiobook I do not think I would have finished it. I'm going with a 4 for completeness. If I was marking how readable this book was, I'd be somewhere around a 2.Recommendation- a great book on Alan Turing IF you are a Mathematician, or you have an in-depth interest in Alan Turing's papers, the politics behind every move he made as a Professor, etc. (Sometimes less is more.)I've not seen it yet, because it's not out in the US until Nov 28th, but... I'd recommend you go see the film- ""The Imitation Game"". It looks like it's going to be fantastic and the book just put me to sleep!"

Starting the story with his parents, the books then tells the story of his childhood until his death from poison which was officially deemed a suicide.The amount of detail on Turing's life covered in the book is enormous. During his childhood in public school, the book shows Turing to be an unusual boy, with a thirst for knowledge in both science and mathematics; and also developing an unusual relationship with Christopher Morcom. But it was to end in tragedy with the early death of Morcom.Deciding between science and maths he decides to major in mathematics in Kings College. It is there that he writes his famous paper that was to feature the Turing Machine and its use in the 'Entscheidungsproblem', showing that it was not possible for a machine to determine whether a problem was solvable or not in a less than infinite time. It was not recognised at the time for the groundbreaking paper that it was in computers.The book then covers his time at Princeton before his return to Britain at the start of World War II. It was here that his work in mathematics is recognised as important for helping to break the various encryption methods being used by the Germans, primarily the Enigma in its various forms. Turing concentrates mainly on the naval Enigma, and the book here gives an overall view of the efforts of many people at Bletchley Park to break the German's encryption, with the help of machines (like the Bombe) that Turing helps to create.After the war, the book looks at Turing's efforts to create a computer based on the ideas he had developed earlier for the Turing machine. He designs the ACE, with ideas that many computer engineers would be familiar with nowadays, but would be considered ground-breaking at the time. But bureaucracy and Turing' lack of 'people skills' would see the project delayed and ultimately trimmed back from his initial vision.In the 1950s, the book looks as his ideas and opinions about computer intelligence and how computers would be used in the future. And it is here that trouble develops. The book mentions his various homosexual relationships throughout the 1930 and 1940s but it would a relationship with a man whom he suspects to have robbed him that would cause the police to investigate him and then charge him for the crime of homosexuality. The tale then ends with his death, officially a suicide.Written in the 1980s, the book thoroughly covers Turing's life, with plenty of footnotes and references. Some knowledge of computer science, computer engineering and mathematics is also needed to grasp and appreciate just how advanced Turing's ideas were at the time when computers as we know it were just being created and were still huge machines limited to research and large companies."
55,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"A biography of Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician and one of the inventors of computer science (together with people like Von Neumann and Shannon) with his ""Turing Machine"", which always fascinated me. Andrew Hodges does a great job in discussing the science behind all of this, and while keeping the story going, doesn't dumb down things like Gödel's theorem or the Entscheidungsproblem too much.Turing was also one of the key people in the British WWII effort to crack the various German encrypion systems, such as the famous Enigma machine. They succeeded in doing that, and played an important role in the allied victory over the Axis power -- or at least allowing England to not crumble under the U-boat attacks.There's a third side to the story - Turing was a gay man in a time where that quite problematic. The book makes it clear that Turing was not secretive about that at all. When he's caught, he makes a full confession, and gets convicted to undergo hormonal treatment to tone his lust. While that is quite bad, at least on the outside, it didn't seem to matter Turing too much... until that moment that he killed himself, perhaps with a poisoned apple.Much enjoyed this book. Looking forward to going through Turing's seminal paper, On computable numbers. Seems he had LaTeX in '36 already![ Post-scriptum: ultimately, Turing received a royal pardon for his conviction in 2013... Andrew Hodges' wasn't too impressed -- from The Guardian:Dr Andrew Hodges, tutorial fellow in mathematics at Wadham College, Oxford, and author of the acclaimed biography Alan Turing: The Enigma, said: ""Alan Turing suffered appalling treatment 60 years ago and there has been a very well intended and deeply felt campaign to remedy it in some way. Unfortunately, I cannot feel that such a 'pardon' embodies any good legal principle. If anything, it suggests that a sufficiently valuable individual should be above the law which applies to everyone else.""It's far more important that in the 30 years since I brought the story to public attention, LGBT rights movements have succeeded with a complete change in the law – for all. So, for me, this symbolic action adds nothing.""A more substantial action would be the release of files on Turing's secret work for GCHQ in the cold war. Loss of security clearance, state distrust and surveillance may have been crucial factors in the two years leading up to his death in 1954.""]"
56,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1154025-rachel,2,"FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY I have finished this book.I purchased it immediately after seeing THE IMITATION GAME- I was still in the theater and pulled out my Kindle right away. Graham Norton's screenplay is, quite frankly, incredible. Moreso when I realized he managed to pull it out of this ridiculously over-detailed and cumbersome biography. That said, Norton does play fast and loose with a lot of facts. It is, quite honestly, a shame that neither the movie nor this book manages to capture both the truth and the fascinating person that Alan Turing was.While Andrew Hodges has certainly does his homework in this biography, it seems that he often gets caught up in showing how much he knows rather than focusing on Alan Turing himself. He spent pages upon pages detailing mathematical theory, and more detailing many different types of computers, and more devoted to a lackluster and quite random analogy with both WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Neither makes much sense in the context of the greater biography, but Hodges returns to it over and over again.Perhaps if you have a mind more mathematical than mine, this book is for you. I found this an endless chore to read, and would have given it up if not for the fact that I spent money on it, and I kept holding out to get to the Bletchley Park era, thinking there was no way Hodges could make Turing's involvement in breaking The Enigma in WWII boring (I was wrong). By that time, I was about halfway through the book and my determination to finish took over.What I did manage to get out of this book was an amazing appreciation for the computer. That I sit and type this review on a machine that easily fits on my desk (and I could write it on a machine that easily fits in my hand) is astonishing; I so wish Alan Turing could have seen some of his visions realized. That he did all that he did in a society that would never accept him was incredible. He was a fascinating man, and this biography did little to show that, despite the clear respect and awe the author has for Turing. "
57,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136820-nicholas,4,"I enjoyed this very much. It's described as a ""new kind of biography"", apparently because of its focus on the mathematics behind Turing's work -- but if this is the new kind, I would hate to read the old kind about Alan Turing, for whom mathematics was so much a part of his life. Andrew Hodges writes with easy strength about everything from Turing's housekeeping habits (poor) to the details of his most well-known paper, which arguably kick-started the field of computer science. Despite Hodges' obvious admiration of and respect for his subject, he nonetheless conveys Alan as a real person, brilliant but human -- which must have been quite a difficult thing to do, thirty years after the fact. I'm very thankful that Hodges could write about one of my heroes in a way that was so accessible to me. But the book falls a little flat when its author starts to ruminate on Alan Turing's death.It's well-known that Turing died young and suddenly, in what is almost universally agreed was a suicide. But if it was a suicide, it was completely unexpected to many: he left no note, had not taken great pains to put his affairs in order, and nobody recalled any changes in his personality immediately prior to the event. Still, depression is a messy business, and one can easily imagine Alan making a spur-of-the-moment decision. But the lack of closure begs for an explanation, and Hodges feels compelled to provide one: the last hundred pages of the book are a re-analysis of Turing's life in the light of attitudes to homosexuality in 1950s Britain, with references to the world stage and in particular the growing power of America. All very interesting stuff, but it's not about Turing, per se. More importantly, it seems very speculative. Was Turing affected by societal attitudes to his sexuality? No doubt. Did that lead to his suicide? Well, perhaps, and in another context I'd probably love to read an essay on the topic, but tacked on to the end of a biography about Turing, it seems a little opportunistic."
58,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11841263-valerie,3,"This book is billed as the book that inspired the recent movie ""The Imitation Game"". Inspired if you mean they both have Alan Turing as their subject. But that's about all the movie & book have in common.The sections of the book that stick to biographical facts are the best and easiest to understand, including the friendship with Christopher Morcomb and his family. The sections that are related to Alan's math discoveries, breaking Enigma, and led to the idea of what we call a computer today are more difficult: it's not a lie to say the man was a genius and if he himself had trouble explaining his ideas to other math professionals, it's not a surprise that Andrew Hodges struggles with trying to explain them to us. I read several of these sections multiple times and still admit that I don't fully understand them. If you're looking for more background on supporting players from the movie, such as Hugh Alexander or Joan Clarke, you're in for disappointment.The book starts to go off the rails with it's confusing use of other stories to try to make points about Alan's life. ""Through the Looking Glass"" is referenced several times- sometimes in relation to homosexuality and sometimes in relation to the Cold War. The comparison of WWII to the US Civil War didn't make any sense to me at all. The most frustrating part of the book was the last 100 pages. Here the author abandons the biographical style and goes into wild speculation about Alan's death. Many of the theories don't seem to jive with the man we've been reading about for the previous 550 pages- Alan doesn't care about politics/traditional authority structures, but now that it's the 1950s, he's suddenly deeply impacted by the changing times, even though he's successfully made it through his trial, served his sentance, and kept his job/been supported by Manchester University? We'll never know the truth, but the crazy theorizing only detracts from the story of the remarkable man.4 stars, with one subtracted for the last section. "
59,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40545757-bubonic,4,"A comprehensive study of Alan Turing, his research, the imitation games he played throughout his life, his lifelong philosophical dilemmas and the answers he sought to justify his existence. While parts of this book weigh on the technical side, it would be an injustice not to include them; for this is the vade mecum of Alan Turing. Alan was always ahead of his time mathematically, computationally and on social ideologies. He never kept it a secret of his sexuality or his passion to understand how the brain learns and works. Always wanting to make a machine behave as though it were human by way of giving it emotions and instincts along with sense stimuli he begged the question: Would a machine behaving as human find other machines attractive? It may sound like a silly question but it is a straightforward point of how far we would have program a computer to give it the appearance of another human: the imitation game.However, the imitation game is an ambiguous definition spanning multiple aspects of his life. From hiding his sexuality from authorities, upholding the secrecy his entire life about his role at Bletchley park, to making a computer imitate a human under an interrogation. The precursors to his suicide still remain a mystery although some tend to think that hormone therapy played a vital role. I do not think this is the cause, as he was on the therapy for only a year. My assumption is that he wrestled with such fundamental questions his whole life and always found himself alone in his thoughts, work and activities. It may be the cause that he felt himself unequal to every other person in his life and not by pretentious measures. In the end, we are all equal in death and I believe that was his way to serenity."
60,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983888-brooks,3,"Saw the movie and knew there were some missing pieces. So a 700 page book more than fills them, more than I needed. It is a straightforward biography with a British twist. So we get family lineage for many generations and numerous rises and falls in class. Finally, we get to his immediate family- his father serving in India. Alan grew up via British public school- the author clearly calling for an end of this institution. Alan suffers horribly including being nailed under floor boards. My main questions coming from the movie were was how was he recruited and why the team was so small. The first was that he had written and was interested in cipher, so even before the war he was corresponding with the government. On the first week of war a group of university folks started at blechily park. As to the organization, it was small 100 or so folks. Many were wrens, female military's. There were many different Germany codes. For the navy alone they had Uboat, surface ships foreign, surface domestic ops, and various weather collection. So, they started with 3 hits for army codes, navy codeshare, and diplomatic. Great initial work by the poles and the British were able to expand. Alan is critical to much of this early work, but while being more comfortable solitarily, in this work he was very much part of a large team. And he did meet Churchill and write him for more resources. The love angle was portrayed just like the book. The book did its best to provide all the mathematical background. I typically enjoy that but soon this went over my head. Yes, the movie oversimplified but that I expected "
61,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5966790-xanthi,2,"I listened to this on audiobook.If you are like me, and saw the film 'The Imitation Game' and had your curiosity piqued about Alan Turning, and wanted to find out more about the man and his life...well...you will get that in this book and more. It is the 'more' aspect that what ultimately made this book a hard slog. Maths is not my strong point. Not even close. And there is a lot of it in this book. A LOT. Understandably, the author had to cover the work, the subjects, the ideas, etc , that Turing was involved with, but the amount of detail given was very high and unless you are specifically interested in maths, you will find yourself as bored (and often confused) as I was, for large portions of this book.Still, the book did provide details on Turing's family, upbringing, schooling, friends, and sexuality. It was also interesting to note the 'artistic licences' the film took. (For example, the age which Alan and Christopher were when Christopher died. They were late teens in reality, and in the film, they were very young - probably to pull on the heart strings more.) Also, in the film, Alan is portrayed very much as being on the autistic spectrum but to get that from the book, you really need to read between the lines. His early death was a tragedy but what lead to it, is more strongly implied in the film, whilst the book handles it in a broader manner by not pointing the finger at one thing in particular.All in all, if you are mathematically minded, and possibly into computer technology, this book is a must. For the rest of us, read if you want, but just be prepared for some boredom and/or bafflement."
62,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64548275-parsa,5,"This book is much more than a mere biography of Alan Turing. Let me explain why. Well, for starters, it's not just a collection of facts about Turing's life. The author is actually a mathematician, and he explains the main mathematical ideas that Turing was engaged with pretty thoroughly. I especially liked his explanations on the Enigma machine. This also brings me to a second reason why. No scientific endeavor is achieved through the acts of just one person. Turing was kind of known to work on problems in isolation, but even in his case, his ideas were built upon giants that came before him(His early work was heavily influenced by Hilbert). This leads to a detailed discussion of a series of important events in early twentieth century mathematics, and some discussion on the philosophy of mathematics. and there was indeed a lot of collaboration or at least a lot of influence from Turing's contemporaries upon his work(Von Neumann, for example, or Clause Shannon). Also, Turing's work, and as we will see, his life, was greatly influenced by the second world war. The book examines the effects of war on Science, Economy, British society, and even views on homosexuality. Lastly, and this is not surprising, Turing is not the man portrayed Hollywood movies. Technical and historical inaccuracies aside, the imitation game(2014) only focuses on Turing's wartime work. But Turing did much more."
63,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1690005-nancy,3," Alan Turing was a British mathematical genius who is credited with breaking the German code in World War II which helped the Allies win the war. Unlike many of the people on this site, my interest in Turing started with Anthony Cave Brown's Bodyguard of Lies and not with the movie The Imitation Game. That will come later. Math is a challenge for me so I was a bit at sea with all the mathematical explanations but found it interesting, nonetheless. I acquired a great admiration for Turing and for his forging ahead despite obstacles in his path. Most people didn't understand him which is not too surprising for a somewhat solitary man who was happiest when he was working on a mathematical problem and questions which interested him. He deserves much credit for his World War II work and for his groundwork on computers. Wonder what he would think of how all this turned out. I could have done with a little less mathematical explanations and a little less of the droning on and on about his homosexuality. The author is to be given credit for his kind and insightful treatment of Turing. It is to be wondered what he could have accomplished had he lived longer to continue the work he started on artificial intelligence. How he has been overlooked all these years and relegated to a relatively minor figure is also a mystery. "
64,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,2,"Wow this book was the very definition of a slog for me. The audio was 30 hours long, which is a lot longer than most books I listen to on audio, and I don't think audio was a great choice for a book this dry. The reader's voice was also just doing nothing to hold my interest. One criterion I use when evaluating an audiobook was whether or not I have a tendency to zone out. I was doing that pretty much constantly here. I really am not sure whether it would have been more captivating on the page or whether it's just an incredibly comprehensive but dry biography.I would be interested to peruse the bibliography, although with an audiobook that information isn't included. The parts of the book that held my attention the most were the parts where it dealt with Turing's homosexuality and the way it was viewed by society at the time. However, most of that is discussed after the part of the book where he dies, so it took a while to get to that.If you want to read this, I would absolutely skip it on audio. If you are good at reading incredibly dense, academic-style prose and just really want to know more about Turing, then check out the paper/ebook edition, otherwise I would give this a hard Bypass."
65,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,4,"I found out a lot from reading this book, soon after seeing the film The Imitation Game which is a very condensed dramatization of some parts of Alan Turing's life. This biography shows that quite a bit of the movie is drama rather than reality but I think it was a good film nevertheless and capture something of Turing's spirit and his problems. This book is not quite as good as it could be or indeed probably would be if written today. I think attitudes to Turing, to homosexuality and artificial intelligence have shifted since it was written but when written it was a pioneering work in new fields. I did not particularly like the Turing that emerges from these pages. I could see his genius but also felt how thwarted his genius was in the times he lives in. This was not true so much during his war time code breaking when the national emergency forced people to pay attention to his mind. But post war an awful mediocrity returned and he was not really able to find the productive niche he might have found later as computing took off. A tragedy not only beause of his suicide and the scandalous treatment that lead up to it but because of neglect of his thinking post war and the closed mindness of organizations.A long read but a compelling one though tough going at times."
66,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2395059-karen,2,"I have never read a more tedious book about such an interesting person in my life.Like many readers, I picked up this book to find out more about the life of Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped to crack the Nazi Enigma code during World War II; came to be considered the father of the modern computer; and is the subject of the recent movie “The Imitation Game.”While the author (who is a mathematician himself) did a good job of piecing together Turing’s life from what written sources exist, he went into WAY too much detail about the abstract math theories that Turing’s work was based on, with no attempt to “translate” it for a general audience. This does a disservice to ordinary readers who are being introduced to this man’s remarkable achievements and tragic end for the first time, only to get swamped by the mathematical minutia. If you’re a math specialist yourself and can understand the theories, then you will probably enjoy this book. Laypeople who want to know more about Turing, however, should probably read one of the more recent, general biographies that have been written about him."

This is it. It explores not only his childhood and the war years, which the film concentrates on, but his work in the nascent computer industry, his work with the mathematics of cellular division, and his death. It's not just a biography, however. It also looks at the prevailing ideas of the time period he lived in and its relations to his life, work and even language. It's certainly detailed at 736 pages but that's what I was looking for. Some of his more philosophic waxings after Turing's death may not be for every taste but he certainly gets to the bottom of Turing's place in history, which I believe will only become more exalted as time progresses. Even the author's note at the end is interesting. Anyone who wants to understand this great scientist should read this. - BH."

This book definitely left nothing out as it pertains to Alan Turing's life and work, and I appreciate the large amount of work this probably took to compile (especially decades ago) But large parts of the book get bogged down in technical details and footnotes upon footnotes that made it feel like a homework assignment at times. I'm a computer programmer and not a complete dummy when it comes to mathematics, but I could only follow about 25% of the more technical theories and ideas. Still I guess this is a testament to how far ahead of me Turing and his associates were in their thinking. He truly was a genius, establishing ideas and theories that were way ahead of his time using nothing but paper and pencil. I wish he could have lived to see a lot of his ideas (both technical and sexual) come to fruition, but thankful he was the right man at the right time to help master World War 2 decryption and lay the groundwork for computers as we know them today. "
69,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2728477-larry,4,"Hodge's biography of Alan Turing is highly interesting, openly sympathetic, extraordinarily detailed, and in need of an editor. It becomes discursive at every turn, going into detail about anything that might have shaped Turing (including a fascinating analysis of whether Turing's wartime work had ruined his serious math career by taking him out of the math mainstream during his prime), but it is essential reading after the largely understandable simplifications of ""The Imitation Game."" Bletchley Park was a much bigger enterprise than the movie suggests. It wasn't just Turing and a half-dozen colleagues; it was a massive operation involving hundreds of workers and thinkers. The American effort alone (using over 300 Enigma machines to crash-break code messages) was massive in scale. The math involved is beyond anything that I understand, but the analyttical assumptions behind Turing's plans for his machine, as well as his views on artificial intelligence, are fascinating."
70,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5884833-graham-crawford,4,"Really enjoyed this tome - It was interesting comparing it to the recent film. Not surprisingly the real history - and Turing's character - was a lot more complex and messy than depicted onscreen.I enjoyed the writing - though there were a number of cringe moments when the author became a little too enthusiastic about his subject. The final chapter almost had a grand metaphor for every paragraph. Thankfully I read the preface last - so I ended the book on a more restrained note which outlined the updates in Turing research made over the 20 years since the original book was published.One of the things that surprised me was just how ""out"" Alan Turing was about his sex life. I had previously imaged him as being somewhat closeted but although his public and private lives were compartmentalised - there was a lot more overlap than I had imaged. I came away from this book having a much more complicated impression of this remarkable man's life."

Hodges is especially good at setting context - he paints a vivid picture of the times in which Turing lived and died. His style has an almost pure academic appeal. It was an arduous effort to finish this gargantuan book. Some biographers write about everything they could find about their subject, with their own narrative of course. Others amplify certain portions of their subject's life and let go off the others. This biography is certainly the former and Einstein's biography by Issacson falls in the latter category. Both were almost the same number of pages but I was definitely less engaged reading Hodge's book. It definitely took some will power to finish it even though there hasn't been another person whose biography I have wanted to read more than Alan Turing's. "

Having seen The Imitation Game, I was curious to know more about the man at the heart of it's story, Alan Turing. I was recommended this and so, finding it on Amazon quite cheap, I decided to give it a go. To say it passed many, many nights worth of time would be an understatement - this book is certainly not the most gripping or the easiest to keep up with, but it does provide the reader with a true, in depth look at the creator of one our most treasured pieces of machinery. His death aged 41, was and still is, in my eyes, a deeply tragic affair, and some consider such to be a tarnish on the reputation he had worked so hard to build over the years, but regardless, this book is a testament to the genius he was - he rightly deserved the pardon he received recently.

I knew he was responsible for cracking the Enigma in WWII, but I had no idea he was pretty much responsible for the concept of the computer, nor that he was so brilliant so broadly in the maths and sciences. The anecdotes demonstrating his capacity for abstract thought definitely showed him in a class of his own among the brilliant of his age. He was an amazing man, involved in amazing things.

Learning about Alan Turing's childhood, his times at school, and his contributions to the war were very interesting. The reason my rating is not a 5, is because it was just a little too heavy on the math. I was expecting hearing about a bit of math, but was not expecting some of the lengthy descriptions of math theories. I felt I needed a tablet nearby to look up some of the theories or famous math/science figures they were speaking about, so I could have a better understanding of the subject.

It contains enough mathematics to give the flavor for Turing's insights and contributions.

Hodges is very thorough in his account of Turing's work and his accomplishments. It is not an easy read only because Hodges spends a lot of time discussing mathematical theories as well as the details of the workings of the Enigma machine and the difficulties behind figuring a way to break the code. This detail is probably necessary but for a non-mathematical/scientific mind it slowed down the actual learning of Turing's life. You can, however, feel the respect that Hodges has for his subject which made it much easier to struggle through the technical stuff. "

You get a lot of that. There are sections that get bogged down in minute details about his work, namely how his Turing machine worked--I skimmed those parts. "
82,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41586491-karen,3,"Very rarely do I recommend a movie over a book...BUT listening to this biography I found too much time spent on theory (& I usually like that stuff!) and not nearly enough on relationships. The Imitation Game culled the theory/design to a manageable level, giving one an appreciation of what was required, but turned more to the human aspects of a remarkable man, Alan Turning and his connections/interactions with some of the other key individuals during his life."
83,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27895221-rita-c,3,"It was a very difficult book to read. So much detail, too much, many times. On the whole I am glad I struggled through to the finish. Alan Turing was a fascinating person, and his life was worth the effort to read about. Reading the Author's note at the end made me happy that Hodges had worked so hard to find out the truth about Turing, as much as possible. I am just disappointed that so much of the movie was made up and so little was actually based in reality."
84,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41874806-bill-lynas,2,"Having read many books about Bletchley Park & the Enigma Code over the years I thought this huge book on the life of Alan Turing would be very interesting. How wrong I was. There's great detail about his early life, which makes for fascinating reading, but when the author starts writing about numerous maths theories I became confused & somewhat bored. I appreciate that the author is a mathematician, so perhaps this book is an easier read for other people in the same field. "
85,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6080971-brant,2,"After getting about halfway through this book (which was a feat in itself), I decided that ultimately I just didn't care enough about Alan Turing to continue. This biography is Charles Dickensesque in its verbosity. For me the only interesting part was the portion dealing with the Enigma machine. The rest was booooooring."
86,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7952147-mark,4,"More than a literal biography, an interesting look at the world Turing lived in and the challenges it presented. I loved that the book didn't set him up as the 'unappreciated god that others simply stole from' but reminded the reader that Turing drew on things that came before him and that others had the same great ideas."
87,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26891991-kelly,4,"Really detailed look at the life of Alan Turing. The film differed quite a bit from the actual events of his life (Keira Knightley’s character had a much larger part in the film). Really enjoyed this. “We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing in a race against an aeroplane.”"
88,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126224-m,5,It takes incredible skill to make detailed descriptions of mathematical and computing problems accessible and even compelling to the lay reader. Hodges also does an admirable job transforming archival research and interviews into a challenging and fascinating narrative.
89,0802775802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12450816-carrie,2,"I enjoyed the film ""The Imitation Game"" so decided to read this book. I am glad to have learned about Alan Turing, but this book is dense and dull and proves just how much artistic liberty was taken in making the movie. I think I am off biographies for awhile. Need time to recover. "
