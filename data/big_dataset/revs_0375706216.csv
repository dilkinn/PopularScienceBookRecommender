0,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,3,"Trilobite: Eyewitness to Evolution covers all aspects of trilobites, from the numerous subspecies to fossils and all points in between.Confession time: I love fossil hunting and I've stooped so far as to buy a small trilobite fossil at a rock swap. I've found trilobites fascinating since I was a little fossil hunter back in the day so I was pretty stoked to read this.I had no idea there were so many subspecies of trilobite and how widespread the species was. The fossil photos were pretty cool. This may have been a case of too much of a good thing. I love trilobites but not enough to make our relationship Facebook-official. Fortey's obsession with trilobites rivals Gusse Fink-Nottle's newt obsession. An entire chapter was devoted to how the trilobite's eyes worked.Richard Fortey is a pretty witty writer, which makes the painstaking detail of some of the chapters much more palatable. His stories took the edge off of what could have been a much drier book. Still, I have to wonder how much of what he reveals is speculation, considering the trilobite has been extinct for millennia. On a side note, I don't see why there couldn't be a small relict population of trilobites on the ocean floor someplace. It worked for the coelocanth. While I was tired of Trilobites near the end, I can't deny that it was a pretty enjoyable book. Three out of five stars."
1,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215702-jenny-brown,2,"Reading the other reviews here, it appears a lot of other people don't agree with me, but I found the author's chatty, self-satisfied style extremely annoying. At times it seemed like he'd written the book more to impress us with how clever he was, and how well-educated in the English classic canon, than to teach us about trilobites. The prose is overly florid, filled with unnecessary words and phrases that the author clearly thought were clever and which might have worked in the context of an informal lecture but which, written, struck me as clichés that added nothing to the narrative.I did manage to pick up a bit of information about trilobites, but it was hard going to pick it out of the matrix of the author's dense, and overwritten prose. I skipped a lot more than is usual for me. But then, unlike many reviewers here, I enjoy reading science books that don't assume that the subject has to be sugar coated to go down.  "
2,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310425-riley,4,"This book taught me all I need to know and more about trilobites, the arthropod that's 300-million existence is so impressively preserved in the fossil record. The subject itself doesn't necessarily speak to me, but I appreciate anyone who is passionate and interested in a subject as author Richard Fortey is in his.Here's one lyrical passage I underscored, about fossil-rich Cornwall in England:""How can we conceive of the time needed to wear away these cliffs to nothing, to convert all the massed slates into fine silt, quartz veins into pebbles -- at first angular, then worn by the constant shuffling of the sea rounder and rounder, until they acquire the contours and colours of a hen's egg? Millenia are irrelevant, species come and go, and still the cliffs stand obstinate against the inroads of time."""
3,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Normally I quite like Richard Fortey's chatty style, but I think maybe there was a bit too much of it, here. He got me interested in geology, so he should've been able to keep me interested in trilobites, but sadly my interest did start to flag. The slight self-deprecating note of some of his other books isn't as much in evidence here, and he definitely came across as more British and more stuck up without that to mitigate it a bit and make him a bit less of a cliché.Trilobites are still interesting, and I'd love to go hunting for them in old shale, but I wanted more focus on the trilobites and less on Richard Fortey."
4,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413418-tim,3,"While mostly good, it was so terribly terribly BRITISH. Dry borderline unfunny anecdotes about some forgotten aspect of English culture went on for far too long when he could have been talking more about his theories of trilobite interactions with their ecology or their particular curiosities of morphology (of which there is never ever enough discussion for my satisfaction). There is a hell of a lot of good and interesting information in here, but the too fluffy emphasis on POP in an admittedly pop-sci book knocks a star or so off. Maybe I'm just too much of a nerd."
5,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,5,"This is a recreation of these creatures which used to roam the sea floors in prehistoric times, explained by an expert. The basic pattern of body, head and tail in segments, with legs allowed for astonishing variations as some creatures adapted to shallow or deep waters, mud floors, rocky or sandy. The trilobites (three lobes) had two eyes made of a solid crystal, amazingly. While all palaeontologists study no-longer living creatures, some have left descendants such as modern sharks or crocodiles and it seems the trilobites have not. The author admits that for years he silently hoped that one day deep sea searches would turn up a colony, but he has now given up on that hope. We still don't know what's down there of course. I enjoyed this book which is well written and presented, and quite accessible. "
6,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2507949-david,5,"Great book with plenty of fine illustrations in line and photographs. When I was studying this sort of thing the textbooks were dull and thick and the writing far too small. I would have loved to have had this book then by way of an exciting introduction. I used to be mad about dinosaurs, as are most kids, but trilobites took over later on and I actually dug up a few myself on the Yorkshire coast."
7,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12235756-steve,5,"I recently read Trilobite, Eyewitness to Evolution by Richard Fortey, 2001. I found it to be a delightful read and I learned all sorts of new things about these fascinating fossil creatures and the worlds they inhabited for 300 million years. Many thousands of species have been described and more are being discovered every year.Trilobites have played a major role in paleontology and have been used as index fossils correlating the ages of geological layers around the globe.They range in size from larger than lobsters to only a couple millimeters in length. As would be expected in a group that lasted that long the amount of variation is staggering; all the way from blind to calcium carbonate crystal for lenses in the faceted eyes, from plain and unadorned to covered with all sorts and shapes of spines.Fortey writes as much about the world they live in as about the trilobites themselves, the other sorts of life they shared the seas with. He uses his own experiences on expeditions of discovery around the world to tell the stories of the fossils and the types and locations of geological formations they are found in today and what those habitats were like when these creatures lived.He was a contemporary with Gould and Eldredge and describes how Eldredge's study of trilobites led him to the concept of Punctuated Equilibrium. He also explains Gould's errors in Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History in a way I had never understood before.Fortey tells an engrossing tale and describes the same excitement of discovery that I have experienced and observed in my colleagues in the study of dragonflies.I can recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting read this winter."
8,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,5,"_Trilobite_ by Richard Fortey is a wonderful, witty, charming, very well-written, and very richly illustrated homage to the trilobite, an arthropod that teemed in the millions in the seas of the ancient earth for 300 million years before becoming extinct. Fortey is an enthusiastic expert on all things trilobite - having studied them for over 30 years - and did an excellent job in conveying his passion for these long extinct creatures in a very readable format with many dozens of excellent photographs and sketches.Early on Fortey introduced basic concepts of trilobite anatomy (he said eight technical names is all anyone needs to describe any species). With the help of a diagram of a representative species, we learn for instance that the head is properly termed the cephalon while the other end -the tail - is called the pygidium. Between the cephalon and the pygidium is the thorax, which is subdivided into segments (thoracic segments). A central convex portion or lobe running down the thorax and pygidium is called the axis, while to either side are the lateral or pleural parts.Reading about trilobite eyes was particular fascinating; they were made of calcite (the same substance that makes up the white cliffs of Dover and was popular in classical architecture), something unique in the entire animal kingdom. Fortey discussed the physics and chemistry of the crystal eyes of trilobites, how they enabled the animal to see, how the lenses on trilobite eyes were arranged and how they functioned, the unique optical properties of calcite, even experiments replicating the vision of individual trilobite species (in particular the experiments relating to the vision of _Phacops_ were extremely interesting; I never knew that physics had such a place in paleontology).We learn also that while whole trilobites are certainly found in the fossil record (or more accurately the carapace of the animal, as the soft and delicate parts such as the legs only rarely fossilize) much of what is found are only bits and pieces, often shed when molting. Thoracic segments, pygidium, and other parts litter the fossil record like puzzle pieces and it is often the job of the trilobite expert to reassemble them, much like a jigsaw puzzle. Some fossils sites - such as Beecher's Trilobite Bed, an Ordovician fossil site in New York - have preserved through unusual circumstances such delicate trilobite parts as their legs (long a mystery to researchers) and even antennae. The details about the life of the trilobite found there - genus _Triarthus_- was fascinating; apparently they lived in a very low oxygen, high sulfur seafloor environment and may have perished during a fatal drop of dissolved oxygen (and were thus preserved) but otherwise lived symbiotically with bacteria that derived energy from sulfur.Fortey introduced the reader to a wonderful parade of trilobite species, relating the history of the group from the Cambrian to its final days in the Permian (the true Age of Trilobites he wrote ranged from the middle of the Cambrian to the Ordovician). We find that trilobites lived in diverse habitats, from the shallowest ""sands to the deepest-water shales; in sunlit reefs and in gloomy abysses."" _Olenellus_ for instance is the commonest of the earliest Cambrian trilobites, a creature the size of a large lobster that was a voracious predator 535 million years ago. _Agnostus_ was a tiny, millimeters long trilobite that swarmed in the millions, odd creatures that only had two thoracic segments and was so abundant that some late Cambrian limestones are made of nothing but this tiny trilobite. _Elrathia kingi_ is the commonest of the ""rock shop"" Cambrian trilobites, a ""middle-of-the road"" typical trilobite, one of many dozens of very broadly similar trilobites that make specialists gnash their teeth. This species has been known to leave tracks that have been fossilized, one of the true ""mud-grubbers"" that plowed furrows in seafloor sediment in its quest for food. _Parabarrandia_ was a streamlined, torpedo shaped Ordovician trilobite, a species that Fortey had performed experiments on in a water tank with dye to prove that it was well suited to a free-swimming role (I never thought one could do experiments on a trilobites; that was fascinating to read). Another free-swimmer was the giant-eyed _Opipeuter_ (Greek for ""one who gazes"") from the Ordovician, with eyes oriented to see forwards and backwards and a body plan designed to house powerful swimming muscles. Also from the Ordovician was _Isotelus_, an unusual animal which completely lacked eyes and had a head surrounded by a border full of perforations, not unlike a colander. This pitted fringe lay about the front of the head sort of like a halo, a rather complicated bit of Paleozoic engineering, the function of which has remained an enigma. The Devonian abounded in trilobites covered in prickles and spines (possibly related to the dominance of fish); one, _Dicranurus_, among its spines appeared to have had great curling ram horns originating at the neck.As fascinating as trilobites are, Fortey had encountered those that question why he has devoted his life to their study. The author made an excellent case that knowledge of trilobites has played vital roles in the debates over the origins of new species and the nature of evolution itself (researches have been able to track changes in trilobite species over time thanks to their great abundance in the fossil record) and in the study of the positioning of ancient continents (as it has been discovered that trilobites make excellent index fossils, not only for marking intervals of geologic time but also to mark the shores of ancient continents, enabling or aiding in the mapping of the ancient world; indeed Fortey himself named an Ordovician ocean, Tornquist's Sea, which separated the continents of Avalonia and Baltica, thanks to trilobites). Fortey weighed in also in such divisive concepts in evolution as gradualism versus punctuated equilibria, the nature of the Cambrian explosion (and what trilobites tell us about that), the origin of eyes in animals, and the importance (and proper interpretation) of the weird Burgess Shale fauna."
9,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Absolutely amazing. I've read Fortey before, and always been impressed, but I'd grown tired of pop sci type stuff, and it had been a while. One of my problems with this type of scientific-story-for-the-masses book is that they generally seem to be a three hundred page book for a fifty or one hundred page story. What starts out really grabbing my attention tends to lose steam about half way through. Fortey doesn't have that problem, because he's not a writer who's found an interesting scientific story. Instead, he's a life-long, professional trilobite expert who also happens to be a great writer. That means that he never runs out of things to say about trilobites (and because he's such a great writer, it's always a pleasure to read).The abundance of scientific terms in Trilobite! could be a little daunting, I think. There is a parade of trilobites at one point, where Fortey introduces a dozen or so genuses with brief descriptions, and scientific names are scattered on all pages. He also throws out about half a dozen anatomical terms (after briefly describing them with a diagram) and whips the reader back and forth through all six periods of the Paleozoic (without any description or diagram). It's a little denser than in most writing for a popular audience, but it's definitely worth it. The major pluses are that, again, Fortey's a great writer, that he has an obvious passion and very deep knowledge and familiarity with the subject, and that it turns out that trilobites are cute and interesting little bugs about which it is worth writing a whole book. You should go read it now!"
10,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275001-peggy,4,"If you’ve ever tried to read a science book, especially one written by a respected expert in a given field, then you know that the books can be a bit…dry. All that material, all of those facts, all of those tables and charts and graphs can be overwhelming to a general reader. But every once in a while, a scientist comes along who is so enthusiastic, so passionate, so giddy in love with his subject that you get swept away in the ensuing rush.Trilobites are some of the earliest creatures in existence captured in fossil form, and Richard Fortey is gaga over them. This book is ostensibly a study of the trilobite fossil record and what that changing record can tell us about the prehistoric world. But what it really is is Fortey’s love letter to the trilobite. He marvels over the fossils; he waxes rhapsodic about the rocks and shales the fossils can be found in; he even dotes on the other scientists, past and present, who have studied trilobites.And you know what? It works. I found myself totally caught up in Fortey’s world o’ trilobites. I shared his pride in identifying new trilobites. I chuckled as he rolled his eyes and poked fun at some of his huffier scientific brethren. And I even began to understand and share his awe at how much can be learned from these ancient creatures.Richard Fortey is proof positive that anything can be interesting with the right teacher."
11,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,5,"I've been disappointed by Richard Fortey's book before, I felt that both Life: An Unauthorised Biography and Earth An Intimate History tried to cover too much ground and ended up being unsatisfying reads.However, despite this and the fact that on his otherwise interesting TV programme on prehistoric animals he seemed almost obsessed with eating the nearest relative of every extinct creature, I do have a lot of respect for Fortey as a scientist. Given also that Trilobites are his specialism I expected great things from this book. And I was not disappointed. 'Trilobite!' is a wonderfully engaging, fascinating and beautifully illustrated history of that mysterious and incredibly varied prehistoric group of animals that were the dominant type of life on earth for roughly six times as long as the reign of the dinosaurs.Fortey is not just interested in Trilobites for their own sakes either (though he fills us in on fascinating details about their natural history and habits) but is interested too in what they can tell us about the prehistoric earth and the movement of the continents and the evolution of life in general. He also muses on the creativity involved in paleontology and the false split that many see between science and arts, he suggests for example that trilobites offer great inspiration for poetry.Even his insistence on finding and eating a horseshoe crab (the closest living relative to the trilobites) couldn't put me off this brilliant book."
12,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4313152-mandy-haggith,5,"This is my partner Bill's favourite book in the whole world. After he'd read it for the fourth time in a row, I gave it a go. Although I wouldn't put it at the top of my desert island books, it is a wonderful read. He is a funny and engaging writer and he draws fascinating insights into evolution from his vast expertise of these long-extinct creatures. Highly recommended."
13,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3157657-veganmedusa,3,"I really wanted to love this book, but sorry, trilobites don't interest me that much. "
14,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108351-anna-kaling,3,"The lack of illustrations has a bigger impact than I anticipated. I'm not sure why the eBook version couldn't have them? I had to pause reading often to look up the species and places Mr Fortey referred to, and as they lacked his annotations I still didn't get the full experience.I like Fortey's writing style - readable, dotted with humour, not pompous. I didn't feel patronised OR out of my depth, as someone who knew very little about trilobites before I began reading. It was a little drawn out and I think it could have been structured more clearly - from the beginning we're told that the book will show us the trilobites' worlds through their eyes, but this doesn't really happen. A chronological structure, beginning with the first trilobites and working up through the eras, may have worked better.Overall, a good introduction to trilobites. It probably would have been 4*s with the illustrations, but as it is I don't think I'll be re-reading."
15,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63251284-thijs,4,"An amazing book that tells you not only a lot about trilobites, but also offers interesting insights into several evolutionairy theories and scientific thinking. (Though for beginners in this, this is not the book to read).Fortey tells us this all with a passion that is undeniable, and some whit and style to boot.What is both a blessing and a curse, I find, is that this book was published in '99, and thus lacks a lot recent studies, and especially genetic studies. A bless because this book tells the stories of Trilobites mostly through the old fashioned way, the trilobite (fossils) themselves.This is unfortunately also a negative in that some mentions or theories may not be entirely up to date, of which I recognised at least one example.Yet this hardly deminishes the reading of the book."
16,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2074446-rick-jones,3,"A mix between fascinating and flowery. I found the author's ability to pack as much metaphor, simile and asides to complicate a storyline to be as annoying as his clear ability to understand the worlds of the deep past to be inspiring, I wish he would have favored a leaner style, and really told the story of the Paleozoic with a crispness that this book lacks. It's all conversational, and you get distracted from the beauty of awakening to the science. Still, despite the density of the language, Fortey makes clear that he has spent so much time thinking about the time in which trilobites lived, and he does manage to convey his insights well, at times. If you like paleontology and the earth's history, you will find enough to like in this book. "
17,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15084140-shannan,3,I really enjoyed many parts of the book but I think for a general reader there are parts you will want to skip. I'd still recommend this book and immersing yourself in deep history though don't chastise yourself if you don't make it all the way through. There is a lot of 5 star content in this book.The imaginings of being on a boat sampling the mud and the diversity that you would have that appears near the end - that was gold.The chapter about the eyes- that is one that will stay with me.I want to see a horseshoe crab in real life now- most closest living relative. 
18,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90293774-brandi-snell,3,"This is a very good book. It's a who's who in Paleontology (esp. reagarding Trilobite studies). It also takes you through the different discoveries of the various Trilobites. Trilobites happen to be one of my favorite beasties, and I didn't know that there were so many different types of them. Enjoyed reading this book, and I learned a few things. I looked up a few words, but that was just because I wanted to know exactly what those words meant. However, I was able to get the gist of those words through the context of the sentences."
19,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"Trilobite! (with the exclamation mark) is Richard Fortey's passionate account of trilobites - their physiology, their crystal eyes, legs, development, evolution and history. This book grew out of the author's love of trilobites. His stated aim is to invest the trilobites with all the glamour of the dinosaur and to see the world through the eyes of a trilobites. This enthusiastic account of trilobites is written in a colourful narrative style that mixes science with personal anecdotes and historical stories. The chapter on trilobite eyes was especially fascinating. There are a few technical terms to be learned, but nothing excessive that would be difficult for the lay reader. The book also includes numerous black/white photographs and diagrams.Trilobites are interesting creatures, but I wanted more focus on the trilobites and fewer anecdotes. I would also have like more information on what may have caused their extinction. However, this book is still fascinating and a joy to read."
20,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68818467-andrew,4,"Did you ever want to know absolutely everything about trilobites? This book will tell you the things you didn't even know you wanted to know. I found the writing style a tiny bit pompous at times, and the author does like to recount his own achievements (while still acknowledging the achievements of others) but I found that if you imagine it being said aloud in an upper-class British accent, it makes sense."
21,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24497967-matt,5,"Despite now being 20 years old and the scientific advances that have been made in that period, this is still a fantastic read. The authors writing is witty and entertaining and really helps in bringing to life these long lost creatures. I have certainly learnt a lot of interesting new facts about one of my favourite creatures. If you're interested in the origins of complex life, the story of the Trilobite is one you really need to follow. "
22,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17689509-antti,4,"Surprising book at the height of evolutionary theory books phenomenon of 2000's. I never understood before that trilobites are such interesting creatures, but they are!Part of special experience is the author's enthusiastic writing style that keeps it all rolling.Actually, the title was earlier Trilobite! not Trilobite"
23,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20711394-cecilie-hjort,2,"I didn't get very far into this book because it tells the story of trilobites through describing a contemporary landscape and the author's childhood love of collecting fossils, and that's just not my thing. For those who like a very painterly and personal approach to explaining science, it's probably very enjoyable."
24,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2173761-lance-grabmiller,3,"An interesting read as the author seems very steeped in English (read very, very British) literature and his classical British education brings a sort of splendor to the whole affair. Also, occasionally his erudition gets the best of him and he can ramble on at times. Still, a delightful way with words on a delightful subject. "
25,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595286-james,3,"This was a fair, if personally chatty, account of his work as a paleontologist and of trilobites. I would’ve preferred more on the latter and probably way more reference photos and illustrations. ˘\_O_o_/˘ "
26,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15938535-harry,4,Richard Fortey is always readable and despite what looks like a rather dry read this is actually very entertaining. But there again I am a professional geologist so I may be slightly biased.

32,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086357-colin,3,"This book does shed light on trilobites - their biology, ecology, evolution and even behavior. For non-scientists, there is plenty of explanation of scientific methods etc. These get pretty repetitive, enough so that I suspect everyone will be skimming/skipping these sections by half way through. Personally I found that it was weighed down by the author's self-involvement. Fortey attempts to bring the book alive with lots and lots of personal anecdotes. It works okay in the beginning but gets old after a while. Part of the problem is that some of these additions add little to the topics he is illustrating. It is enough of an issue that I found myself pretty bored by the last through of the book. The bigger issue is his ego which comes through loud and clear. Fortey loves to talk about his own discoveries and accomplishments. That is warranted in many places but it happens so frequently that it left me wondering what other researchers have found. It's not that he doesn't mention the successes of others, but many of those are historical figures and the current ones are uncommon and frequently are colleagues of his. Cronyism is nothing new in such books, but combined with the giant number of personal contributions to the field and the overall paucity of others makes it stand out. His acknowledgement of dissenting opinions is even rarer. Most are only snidely hinted at. For instance, he mentions that one of the new species he named was contested by others but doesn't say anything else; his dismissal of them is so strong he doesn't bother to go into detail. It was a missed opportunity to discuss the process of identifying and naming new species or groups. He does eventually discuss that fascinating issue and gives some good examples of similar research and arguments making his lack of detail on that particular story all the more confusing. For the most part he avoids the vitriol characteristic of Richard Dawkins and some other popular science writers, even calling Dawkins to task for it at one point. One exception is his in depth discussion of Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History by Stephen Jay Gould is well done but odd in it's detail. I actually wondered if he had a particular problem with Gould, and I'm still not sure (he does mention Gould in a more positive light later but not in any really detail). BTW - I am a HUGE fan of Gould's writings, so I'm admittedly biased here but I saw no issue with Fortey's points, rather I was taken aback by how much attention Gould and his book got in that section.The end result is a mix of the really interesting and the really tiresome. Sadly, these are common issues in popular science books. Brian Greene & George Schaller are great example of scientists (non-scientists writing about science generally never have such issues) that have been able to write great popular books on their fields. Richard Fortey is a world-renowned expert on trilobites and the depth of knowledge he displays is wonderful. This is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in trilobites or paleontology, just be prepared to skim through sections of it.  "
33,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"The Beetles of the Paleozoic.As this is my first book written by Richard Fortey I didn't quite know what to expect from this British paleontologist. Part science, part history and autobiography, Trilobite is written with a poetic slant that can take the reader off on some of the author's personal musings on a variety of subjects that are seemingly unrelated to trilobites but, sooner or later, he reveals the connection. Fortey's first job as a professional paleontologist was at a museum, a dream come true, ""Getting paid for what I loved doing!"". I found the chapter on museums and the process of naming a new species to be to be very interesting, but some readers might not agree with me on that. The opening chapter takes place on the North Cornwall Coast of South West England near the town of Boscastle and starts with the author retracing the steps of a fictional character, from a novel that I was not familiar with, who encounters a fossil trilobite on a storm-tossed cliff overlooking the Atlantic. In this round about way he brings you to the heart of his book: trilobites. And this book is indeed about trilobites and everything you ever wanted to know about them. In the late 17th century we find the earliest reference to trilobites when a ""gentleman fossil-collector"" wrote of finding some fossil ""flat fish"" that turned out to be trilobites. In exploring the history of trilobite research the author introduces you to some early workers like Charles D Walcott (about 1910) and Harry B Whittington (late 1960's) of Burgess Shale fame (see S Gould's 1989 Wonderful Life). Walcott discovered appendages (legs) in a fossil trilobite (1876). In 1893 William D Matthew was the first to spot fossilized antennae, plated with Iron Pyrite, confirmed by a Professor Charles E Beecher. All of these early workers were not only finding fossils, they were also doing research on trilobite anatomy, evolution and number of species. The research continues to this day. Traditionally, trilobites were considered, by some, to be losers in their evolutionary race for success but they were around for over 300my, had thousands of species and each were finely tuned to their environment--sounds like success to me. What caused their extinction is open for debate but changes in their habitat and environmental conditions that they were unable to keep up with is a good bet, that's the fate of all species and maybe us humans as well. I found Fortey's writing style to be ornate and, at times, quite technical, but not so technical that it overwhelms the layperson reader. The chapter on trilobite eyes was outstanding, some had them mounted on long stalks others were large and bulbous and some species were even blind. I had no idea that trilobites were so diverse, evolving to fill a wide range of habitats from shallow seas to the abyssal deep with numbers beyond counting. Some sported an assortment of spines or bumps that must have served some sort of function. Fortey covers it all in fine detail mixed with some speculation. While not for everyone, this book is right on track for anyone interested in paleontology, evolution and nature in general. I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition and, as far as I could tell, all of the illustrations and plates are included.Last Ranger"

Many thanks to Adele for lending me this super awesome and well written book!TRILOBITES is not only just a fossils says Richard Fortey. It contains many stories behind its carrapaces and moulting stages. Famous in Cambrian Period and vanished in the end of Ordovician Period, this living fossils manifests extraordinary features and reveals magnificent roles when earth still young and human doesn’t existed.I like how Fortey describes trilobites from many different angles and segments. I also like when he puts many ingenious quotes from Shakespeare ‘HAMLET’ to Edgar Allan Poe for example. As a travel writer, Fortey gives inspirations for all of us to write more in details without feeling guily. To describe ten centimeters fossils in 250 pages definitely needs some talents and not many people can do that in a such way like Fortey does. TRILOBITES! may you can define as semi biography book from Richard Fortey himself although He is already have hiw own autobiography. You can find his incredible experiences as Trilobilogist which maybe for some people mentioned it as a very dull job in the lab or museum. As a popular science writers, I found his writings is easily understood by people who doesn’t have any biological or geological background. I also found from his writing that I can learn many good ethics and advices to be a much better scientist in the future. During the reading, I made some notes which I think it would be interesting and useful like below:•	Science doesn’t sleep while still there is Trilobilogist (and this also applied to all scientist all around the world!).•	You always can find person with the same interest like you all over the world. This could mean to be a scientist doesn’t mean you are isolated from your world although you have some specific area studies which is very common happened if you already specified your research studies. •	Cladistics: similarities studies between species based on evolutionary derived characteristics.•	PAUP (Phylogenetics Analysis Using Parsimony): cladistics analysis tools developed by David Swofford.•	To study history of life, you must go to the museum! I found this opened eyes fact through the reading. Sometimes I think that going to museum seems not really important but somehow I have to go to the museum! All of us will never learn with direct interaction by going to museum although you already have internet at home. Museum existence is important for young generation for sure and suddenly I remember my first experience going to Geological Museum in Bandung. •	Science depends on honest reporting! There are so many unethical scientists and many more blacklisted because of work or fraud they caused. Looking through many experiences and reading TRILOBITES! I found that to be a good scientist sometimes is not enough. You have to be an ethical scientist when you’re doing your work!•	Something small doesn’t mean isn’t featureless. Appreciate everything in life even it seems unimportant for now. Trilobites for example which maybe almost nobody know and understand about their roles in evolution. "
35,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"I have to admit that I read this book purely on a whim, because I wanted something non-fiction to read from the library. Previously I had never read anything by Fortey nor even heard of him, and always thought that trilobites only came in the ""classic"" shape and size of Phacops that I'd seen in so many museum gift shops. The alarming monstrosity displayed on the cover of this edition piqued my interest, and soon I was away with the humble trilobite.Concepts of evolution where what I found fascinating about this book, particularly the idea of neotony-these are all still concepts that are relevant today and in places in almost seemed like Fortey was bursting with enthusiasm for evolution in general, with trilobites just on hand to serve as a perfect example! The personal reminisces and ""poetic"" style that Fortey occasionally dabbles with seem to have been the subject of a certain opprobrium in some reviews, and it can get a little wearing, and struck me as almost a little defensive in places, as if he thought it was necessary to dress up what people might see as subject matter with little depth. He needn't have bothered, as when he is at his most interested (the marvellous explanation of their unique crystal eyes for example) the writing is infectious. Overall though his easy going method makes the book a breeze to read, and has made me think about evolution in rather more depth than before.Next I think someone should put together a book about the craft of FAKING Moroccan trilobite specimens, which strikes me as superbly niche market."
36,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51182403-trenchologist,5,"This is clearly titled with an exclamation for a reason! Fortey is a man with passion, and everything he studies then writes about is imbued with this passion. His greatest love (of the not-persons kind I will assume) is for the trilobite, and this is as much the story of how he fell in love as about the trilobite itself. He loves what he does and wants you to love it too; it's easy to fall. Packed with info, never bogged by facts, always witty with lilting, whimsical, or stoutly direct turns of phrase, this read is a gainer: you learn a lot but don't notice what all you're absorbing until it's too late. When the third chapter is succinctly entitled Legs and you're so immersed in the subject that you're eager to get there, you know you're onto something good. If this was how textbooks were written, we'd all know so much more by now. This is also like time with old, familiar friends for me, hearkening back to my childhood days, geologic hammer in one hand, field guide in the other, and the determination to find a new species of dinosaur-amazing-rawr (or even just a few nifty crinoids) in mind."

Science writing at its best. This book is to trilobites what Sagan’s “Cosmos” is to astronomy and history of science; what Dawkins “The Selfish Gene” is to gene-centric view of evolution, and what Hawking’s “A brief history of time” is to cosmology and relativity. Richard Fortey’s style combines the best of those modern science writing authors plus a lot of pleasing British humor and references to literature (I was delighted to find out he likes Jorge Luis Borges work!), geology (of course) history, epistemology, optics and chemistry, among many, many others subjects. A modern classic definitely, with only one minor flaw: he uses too much he “D” word when referring to living organisms.""…the cephalon is designed to...""""Man is designed so...""""…the most diverse and varied of all animal designs.""And so on and on and on. This book is a creationist’s quote-mining cornucopia. But fortunately it is also many other things, all of them good."

Is this the only song to refer to a trilobite? http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EMwxwRA9...Phew, quite a marathon of Trilobite arcana but Fortey's passion for the genera knows no bounds. Some surprisingly light hearted moments amongst the weight of knowledge and paleobiology. The notion that oceans that no longer exist once teemed with hundreds of thousands of different species of trilobites is mind boggling and the fact that some human beings have made it their life's work to learn all about these long dead creatures and along the road discovered what the earth may have looked like then.... is almost as extra-ordinary as the creatures themselves. To dedicate one's life to the Trilobite..... That one person should choose to do this is curious but that so many have done so tells us that here must be an extra-ordinary creature... I am not sure that I appreciate even now why trilobites are soooooo fascinating but I certainly have a much better grasp of their importance. "
39,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036072-david-evans,4,"If you only read one trilobite book (you know you should) this must be the one. Professor Fortey is incapable of writing a boring paragraph and you will learn far more than is healthy about these arthropods, that survived 300 million years on earth, and much else besides. The author's knowledge and enthusiasm is infectious starting at The Cobweb Inn at Boscastle, Cornwall, Fortey climbs the ""Cliff With No Name"" to find the spot where Knight comes face to face with his own mortality in the form of one of these fossilised Arthropoda in the Thomas Hardy' masterpiece, ""A Pair of Blue Eyes"". Prof Fortey acknowledges Hardy''s grasp of deep time but points out that trilobites aren't found on this cliff whereas they are abundant a few miles further north on the coast of Pembrokeshire where the author found them as a young boy leading on to his lifelong fascination and study of these creatures."
40,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711341-marfita,3,"I don't want to give away who dunnit.This book made me want to get a little hammer and go out looking for fossils. Okay, I've always sort of wanted to do that, but this intensified that feeling! Fortey might try just a bit too hard to be humorous which might go over well in a class but just made me groan. It is plain that he has had a balanced education he's not letting go to waste, despite the childhood obsession that became his life's work. Fortey weaves literature, personalities, and scandal into the trilobite story. It was hardly necessary; trilobites and all the minutiae involved fascinate me. Oh, and the eyes, their eyes! I have two more Forteys in the stack to read. They take such a gosh-awful long time to digest, but are worth it in the end. I am also delighted that I too now know that Paradoxides is the ""genus of the trilobite of the Middle Cambrian"" just like Tim Brooke-Taylor. You have to follow ISIRTA to find that funny."
41,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"Trilobites were a class of arthropods in the Paleozoic, as common then as beetles are now. They had biramous limbs, like crustaceans, which were undifferentiated - no lobster claws for them; they were protected by a shield, which fossilized readily. Since it was realized in the 17th century that fossils are not just geological formations that happen to look like living things, but remains of living things, trilobites have been studied by several great paleontologists. Richard Fortey loves trilobites: he found his first at age 14, hammered them out of Spitzbergen rocks in his early 20s, and now studies their distribution around the world, using them to sketch out the boundaries of continents before they coalesced into Pangaea, and tells his fellow commuters, ""Today I moved Africa 600 kilometers to the south."" I am glad that there are people who love their work as much as Richard Fortey somewhere out there."
42,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3436890-dennis-boccippio,4,"This book was surprisingly enjoyable. The narrative style is a little colorful, but I disagree with some of the reviews that found it ""overmuch so"" (though this will be a matter of personal preference I think). I found the mixture of literary indulgence and scientific exposition refreshing. The style works wonderfully in the first half where trilobites are introduced first as a very ""rough sketch"", then more and more details layered in, somewhat channeling the spirit of discovery. It draws the reader in and helps overcome the ""how am I ever going to read 250 pages about trilobites"" vibe.The style works a little less well in the two chapters focused on evolution ... Here I would have preferred a little less poetry and a little more precision. I left these chapters with the sense that I missed or didn't fully comprehend some ""big"" issues, only getting a flavor."
43,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,4,"I so enjoyed Fortey's book ""Earth"" that I added this and another of his earlier works to my To Read list. One of the things I enjoy about Fortey is that he takes what could be an extremely dry and dull subject and makes it colorful and interesting to the lay reader. For example, he starts off by describing the old pub on the Cornish coast from where he sets off on his first trilobite hunt. The amazing thing about trilobites is the sheer number of species and body types (too many to look at in a human lifetime according to the author). If you have an interest in palaeontology, evolution or plate tectonics, you should enjoy this book. If you do read it, by all means follow up by reading ""Earth""."
44,0375706216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3248359-justin,4,"A good book, but could have been much better. I couldn't help thinking at the end of the book of all of the missed opportunities to discuss some of the BIG evolutionary ideas. The section on Conway-Morris vs. Gould was really interesting, and the rest of the book mostly deals with the history of Trilobite discovery and anatomy - which is cool. But missing is an in depth discussion about the big events in trilobite history, like what may have caused their extinction. I kept getting the feeling that Fortey was avoiding any controversial ideas, or ideas about trilobites that are still relatively unsupported. But a book like this is actually a perfect place for ideas like that."

Could have benefitted from a more linear structure instead of the authors meandering chapters, and he's never as cute as he thinks he is. Neptune's Ark is a better example of a fun non-fiction evolutionary fossil journey, but I'll be damned if trilobites are awesome no matter what. There's lots of good stuff in here, from the trilobites, to the scientists, to scientific philosophy. Absolutely could have used more pictures, trying to describe endless fossil genera and plate tectonics requires lots of pictures! "

Fortey is a man completely in love with trilobites. This book was great, it taught me a lot on the subjects of evolution, paleontology, and science in general. It is fascinating to me that by identifying certain species of trilobites, scientists can piece together geographical maps of the Paleozoic world. Fortey writes almost as if he were speaking to a lecture hall, he adds interesting side stories while discussing his favorite topic. I would read other books by Fortey, and recommend his writing to anyone interested in science."

I don't mind his stories about scientists and how he includes the history of discovery as well as the discoveries themselves, but I could do without descriptions of the weather. The topic is already interesting, that's why I picked up the book! Forget all that and talk to me about trilobites, darling.But anyway. I was super curious about trilobites after reading various other books about evolution, and particularly the author's museum memoir, so this book hit the spot."

'tis a neighbor with their hearth alight, methought. On I read about the crystalline eyes of the trilobite, and yet the odor lingered. It was only then that I realized that the Fresnel lens I had position afore a kachina doll (to make it appear - très badass) was catching the sunlight thus to cause its feathers to smolder.

Yes again! Fortey uses the story of trilobites' rise and fall to tell the story of earth's changing face as continents moved and ice ages came and went over 300 million years. He clearly has a deep and thorough love of these varied, long-dead creatures, and passes this on to the reader."
