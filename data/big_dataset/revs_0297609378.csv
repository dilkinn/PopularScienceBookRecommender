There are a thousand books on racism, but hardly any on race. Isn’t that curious? I believe that may be because scientists realise it’s a hornet’s nest and they prefer not to stick their heads in.I recently heard of Nicholas Wade’s A Troubling Inheritance (2014) but before I got to that one I found this one, which turns out to be pretty much what I was looking for – a third of it anyway, the other two thirds is above my head. But first, what can genetics do for you?SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE GENE FOR RIDICULOUS SCIENTIFIC CLAIMSAdam Rutherford does a search on Google : “Scientists discover the gene for”. It gets him thousands of headlines from every type of publication “from the trashy to the august”.Scientists discover the gene for cocaine addiction (Guardian 11 November 2008)Scientists discover height gene (BBC Outline, 3 September 2007)Scientists have discovered an “anxiety gene” (Daily Mail, 19 July 2002)Scientists find “gay gene” that can help predict your sexuality (Daily Mirror, 9 October 2015)Scientists find gene for compulsive reviewing of books on Goodreads (Okay, I made that one up)Adam Rutherford holds his head in his hands and moans slightly. Then he writes this book, the message of which isIt’s much more complicated than that.Mainly this book is a deflating mythbusting exercise – you can’t check anyone’s DNA and find out what percentage of her is from the Sudan and what percentage is Viking. It’s a bit disappointing really – I wanted to ask Dr Rutherford, well, what can you tell me? Never mind about what you can’t. He likes to say what you can’t do. RACEOne of the things he thinks genetics can do and has done is show that scientifically speaking, there’s no such thing as race. This was the best part of the book. I like it when people draw a line in the sand. Actually, in this case, he’s obliterating the many previous lines which have been drawn in the sand. there are no essential genetic elements for any particular group of people who might be identified as a “race”. As far as genetics is concerned, race does not exist…. This does not align with the popular concept of race.He hastily adds That, of course, does not mean that racism doesn’t exist.Okay, he’s willing to say that there may be other interpretations:The question of what race means from a scientific point of view is complex, controversial and still a source of great ire and debate.But that doesn’t last long :Biology fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person…. The genes that confer skin pigmentation are few, but mask a level of deeper genetic variation within Africa than without. JEWISH SONGWRITERS, BLACK ATHLETESSo then we get to the ticklish question – what about when it appears to be clear that a particular “race” appears to be BETTER at some activity than other “races”? Is it racist to say that, for instance, Jewish Americans have been consistently brilliant at writing popular music for about a hundred years? (This is something which particularly fascinates me.) All the way from Gershwin and Rodgers and Hart to Goffin and King and Greenwich and Barry and on to Randy Newman, Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen – the list is endless. Is it in their genes? Dr Rutherford picks another obvious example, black athletes. It turns out : there is no genetic component. He says robustly:The idea that black people are better at sport because of genetics, and possibly because of breeding during the wicked centuries of slavery, is built upon tissue foundations, and its cultural ubiquity yet another example of the chasm between what we think and what science says is true.Well, it’s a curious thing. Adam Rutherford along with other geneticists say very clearly that race does not exist, but of course as we know every day the world ignores this and proceeds on the assumption that everyone is a member of a discrete race, or is to be classified as mixed race. So it all becomes rather like atheists arguing that there’s no God when almost everyone in the world operates on the assumption that there is.I think we must conclude that the human race, speaking generally, does not much care what scientists say is real or not real. There’s just no telling them. They just stick their fingers in their ears and say to people like Adam Rutherford “la la la la, we’re not listening”. "

British.In the sense that its assumed core audience was Brit, and a lot of the references and examples aimed at them. I watch enough PBS and read enough Britlit not to be wholly at sea, but I noticed in a way that might be invisible to the intended audience. The writer almost always corrects the casual assumption that his reader will be male, but he misses a few subtle spots. (Dear lord English desperately needs a generally accepted, unclumsy gender-neutral pronoun besides the plural ""they"", which only works sometimes.)It was about 50% the book I was hoping for, an account of the latest findings in deep human history and evolution from DNA evidence. Many of the examples were things I already knew about, because PBS. There was a lot of patiently attempting to explain how science really works, from a scientist/science journalist who is clearly deeply pained by how headlines and pop science news and the general public consistently get it wrong; remedial science education, on the fly. The other 50% was more about the current intersections of genetics and social and legal issues. Written in a chatty modern style. Lots of personal anecdotes, and some opinions, partly to try to lighten the density of the material perhaps, partly to illustrate it.I have another book on order from the library from 2018 that would appear to cover some of the same ground, with updates perhaps -- and Rutherford is right that updates in this fast-moving field are happening every week. We'll see if the paired readings complement each other.Ta, L.* -- Oh. And do read the footnotes. As is common, much of the fun stuff is concealed therein."
2,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,5,"The unwelcome revival of ‘race science’.....https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018...=======“What genes are and what they tell us about people are very closely related, but not, in almost all cases, definitive. This is a seam that will run throughout this book, confronting and dispelling the culturally ubiquitous idea that genes are fate, and a certain type of any one gene will determine exactly what an individual is like. That this is a fallacy is universally known among geneticists, yet it is still an idea that carries a lot of cultural significance, fueled frequently by the media and an ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human biology............When we look to the past and to our presumed genetic ancestry to understand and explain our own behaviors today, it is not much better than astrology. The genes of your forebears have very little influence over you. Unless you carry a particular disease that has passed down the family tree, the unending shuffling of genes, the dilution through generations, and the highly variably and immensely complex influence that genes have over your actual behavior mean that your ancestors have little sway over you at all.""=====================""There are no essential genetic elements for any particular group of people who might be identified as a “race.” As far as genetics is concerned, race does not exist.""====================""With our current knowledge of the genomics of of Native Americans, there is no possibility of DNA being anywhere near a useful tool in ascribing tribal status to people. Furthermore, given our understanding of ancestry and family trees I have profound doubts that DNA could ever be used to determine tribal membership.....Over centuries, people are too mobile to have remained genetically isolated for any significant length of time. Tribes are known to have mixed before and after colonialism, which should be enough to indicate that that some notion of tribal purity is at best imagined. Genealogy companies will sell you kits that claim to grant you membership to historical peoples, albeit ill-defined, is highly romanticized. It's a kind of of genetic astrology.That hasn’t stopped the emergence of some companies in the United States that sell kits that claim to use DNA to ascribe tribal membership. The list is comprehensive, from Abenaki to Zuni. Accu-Metrics is not the only company: DNA Consultants sells a Cherokee test for $99. There is no biological test that alone can demonstrate tribal membership. These outfits state: “All tests can be done for legal purposes” and “The results of this scientific test can be used to receive a status card or tribal enrollment.”The author goes on to express full sympathy to Native Americans and their traditions and religion. And their rights. He just wants to debunk profiteers who claim to provide what is scientifically impossible at this time.Meanwhile, the author debunks several ""genetic services"" such as Accu-Metrics and DNA Consultants above, as well as BritainsDNA. The latter claims to have found some of the descendants of the Queen of Sheba, a mythical figure. 23andMe comes off as more solid, but has its limits. But too often the ""results"" from many of these other services sound like astrology: divination drawn from banality in which we tend to cling to the things that appeal, and happily ignore the rest. But the media likes to pick up on the more sensational claims.-----Too funny: Charlemagne could be out of LOTR, with maybe some Harry Potter thrown in....""A fecund ruler, Charlemagne sired at least eighteen children by motley wives and concubines, including nine by his second wife, Hildegard of Vinzgau. These kin included Charles the Younger, Pippin the Hunchback, Drogo of Metz, Hruodrud, Ruodhaid, Adalheid, Hludowic, and not forgetting Hugh""""Christopher Lee— the great actor who among his roles counts Dracula; Tolkien’s Saruman the White; the Man with the Golden Gun himself, Scaramanga; the fallen Jedi Count Dooku; and The Wicker Man’s Lord Summerisle— claimed direct ancestry to King Charlemagne via the ancient house of his mother, Countess Estelle Marie (née Carandini di Sarzano)....but I can say with absolute confidence that if you’re vaguely of European extraction you are also descended from Charlemagne.""I have a very detailed genealogy on my father's side, going back to the arrival to America of our ancestor in 1636. But we had nothing like that on my mother's side. Her maiden name was Martel and she liked to say were were related to Charlemagne. The father of Charlemagne, was Charles Martel, known as ""The Hammer"" having led the Frankish troops in the Battle of Tours in turning back the invading Muslim forces from Gaul. But it seems that my mother may have been right.The population of Europe a the time of Charlemagne was small and he was very ""fecund"" as noted. The author explains....""Each generation back the number of ancestors you have doubles. But this ancestral expansion is not borne back ceaselessly into the past. What this means is that pedigrees begin to fold in on themselves a few generations back and become weblike. You can be, and in fact are, descended from the same individual many times over. Your great-great-great-great-great-grandmother might hold that position in your family tree twice, or many times, as her lines of descent branch out from her, but collapse onto you. The further back through time we go, the more these lines will coalesce on fewer individuals. Basically, everyone alive in the ninth century who left descendants is the ancestor of every living European today, including Charlemagne, Drogo, Pippin and Hugh.""If this seems unlikely or confusing, of course you will have to read the book to get more details. The author goes on to explain how this was demonstrated mathematically even before the incorporation of high-powered DNA. Ultimately, this kind of analysis extends beyond Europe and farther back in time, as the book explains. ""When mathematician Joseph Chang factored in new, highly conservative variables, such as reducing the number of migrants across the Bering Straits to one person every ten generations, the age of the most recent common ancestor of everyone alive went up to 3,600 years ago. This number may not feel right, and when I talk about it in lectures, it often results in a frown of disbelief. We’re not very good at imagining generational time. We see families as discrete units in our lifetimes, which they are. But they’re fluid and continuous over longer periods beyond our view, and our family trees sprawl in all directions. The concluding paragraph of Chang’s otherwise tricky mathematical and highly technical study is neither of those things. It’s beautiful writing, extremely unusual in an academic paper, and it deserves to be shared in full:Our findings suggest a remarkable proposition: no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant sloths in the forests of North and South America, and who laboured to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu.""============Darwin's half-cousin, Francis Galton, was the founder of the eugenics movement. He created a taxonomy of physical and personality attributes to determine if a person, and people, were of superior stock or ""feeble."" This concept was quite popular across the political spectrum. George Bernard Shaw approved, as did Winston Churchill, as did Teddy Roosevelt. But a program was not seriously implemented in Britain, but it was in the U.S., Sweden and, of course Germany.The head of the eugenics movement in America was President of Stanford University, David Starr Jordan, who was a founding member of the American Breeders Association and the Eugenics Record Office. In the U.S......""the forced, involuntary, and often secret sterilization of undesirables was embraced enthusiastically. From 1907, when Indiana passed the first mandate, until 1963, forced sterilization was legally administered in thirty-one states, with California the most vigorous adopter. The most recent cases of forced sterilization in that famously liberal state occurred in 2010. In the twentieth century, more than 60,000 men and women, though mostly women, were sterilized for a variety of undesirable traits— men frequently to curtail the propagation of criminal behaviors. Native American women were forcibly sterilized in their thousands, and as late as the 1970s, black women with multiple children were being sterilized under the threat of withheld welfare, or in some cases without their knowledge.""In 1937, the American Eugenics Society issued statements of praise for the work that the Nazis were doing to cleanse the gene pool. For them, the scale on which the Nazis were carrying out their mass sterilization was what they had wanted for America.Of course, the fullest horrors would come with the Nazi Holocaust, which not only included Jews in their millions, but also homosexual men, Roma, Poles, and people with mental illness.----The author discusses the futile search for a ""criminal gene,"" supposedly a defective MAOA gene. Though sensationalized in the media, it has never been established scientifically. Although, for example, the ""finding"" has been conveniently ascribed to the Maori people by white scientists in New Zealand.There was also an attempt, based on a preconceived notion, to discover such a gene in Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter. The killing of 20 children, and 26 people overall, was quite horrid, but what was to blame? Video games? that he was autistic? Nope. It was the answer so many wanted to resist and what the author gives....""We look to statistics for reassurance in these types of case. Here is one: 100 percent of mass shootings have been enabled by access to guns. I can guarantee that even if there were a genotype shared by the mass shooters, which there will not be, none of the killings would have happened if they didn’t have guns.""""No one will ever find a gene for “evil,” or for beauty, or for musical genius, or for scientific genius, because they don’t exist. DNA is not destiny.""------------Per Europe....https://www.nature.com/news/most-euro...More on the Eugenics movement....http://listverse.com/2014/02/05/10-th...https://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/12...==============In keeping with the science in this book. Elizabeth Warren's DNA test proves nothing....""The inherent imprecision of the six-page DNA analysis could provide fodder for Warren’s critics. If her great-great-great-grandmother was Native American, that puts her at 1/32nd American Indian. But the report includes the possibility that she’s just 1/1024th Native American if the ancestor is 10 generations back.""Not satisfied with this, in a video that Warren released along with the analysis, she described how her mother had discussed their Native American ancestry. Family lore held that there were Cherokee and Delaware indigenous ancestors.The Cherokee Nation condemned Warren’s analysis in a statement Monday.“Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong” As explained above, there is no DNA test to demonstrate direct tribal heritage, Cherokee or otherwise.==========Interesting new development,. A coalition of Native American leaders have asked Elizabeth Warren to reject her false claims of being Native American. Contrary to rumor, she did not invoke it to get her position at Harvard, but when she applied to the Texas State Bar she listed her identity as ""Native American"" She's an example of someone who has assumed a false identity which, in the case of many others who have, has resulted in the appropriation of funds that were intended for Native Americans, but went to others. https://www.latimes.com/california/st...============The author's follow up book....https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
3,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"The stories of our genes have been all over publishing right now and this is one of the best examples of how scientists can make complex subjects interesting, relevant, and fun. Adam Rutherford reads his own work, something I particularly love as it enables the author to convey the passion and enthusiasm they hold for their subject in a way that no narrator can match. And he's funny with it too. It's one of those listening experiences where you end up feeling like you've learnt something but had a good laugh doing it. He debunks myths with dedication and humour (the section on the extinction of gingers is particularly amusing), explains the current status of research and knowledge, and offers the some idea about how much more there is to learn. It's truly fascinating.For me, as a history enthusiast, I really enjoyed the way science and history are coming together to offer insights that neither subject can do alone. For example, in genetically mapping the people of Britain, it was found that there was very little of the Roman invaders left in our genes, suggesting that while they may her left us many things within the material, cultural, and social spheres, they clearly weren't interacting with us more physically. That says a lot about the whole systems in place during a very long period. Happy to rule us, but not have sex with us clearly. Not only that, I had no idea how many different types of humans there have been, what types of remains had been found, and the ways in which scientists are using these remains to map the movements of ancient peoples. That we can see the full genome of people who lived many thousands of years ago is staggering, the we continue to pass on some of that information within our genes is incredible. This book has turned me from someone largely uninterested in the specifics of prehistory to a bit of a fan. Like a lot of history, it's a thrilling form of detective work and the science of our genes has so much to say.I very much recommend it, even if you are new to the subject, as I was. The experience reminds me of having that one favourite teacher at school- you know the one who converted you on to a specific subject and nurtured your interest. For me, it was history, not science. But Rutherford has shown me how it can be a mix of both. "
4,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an entertaining book about what genetics tells us about ourselves, and what it does not tell. For example, genetics tells us that a certain small percentage of our genes comes from Neanderthals. It cannot tell us if you descended from a particular tribe of Native Americans. DNA analyses tell us about tendencies, but does not tell you that you are violent, or prone to Alzheimer's disease, or what ""race"" you belong to. In fact, genetics cannot distinguish among races--it is a social classification, not a biological one.I got a kick out of reading about how so-and-so claims to be a direct descendant of Charlemagne. The claim is true; but just about every European is also a descendant. The book is packed with interesting anecdotes. The most riveting story is about England's King Richard III. The exhuming of his grave and subsequent DNA analysis fully corroborated the legend of his life and death, and the his portrayal by Shakespeare. Since he died 600 years ago, he is probably the oldest corpse positively identified through DNA analysis.I enjoy reading science books that are written by scientists who truly understand their field--as long as the book is well written. And this book is--the author is a geneticist, and the book is filled with the author's dry wit. It reminds me a lot of the books by Bill Bryson. I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by the author. The author's narration is clear, and his British accent is charming. "
5,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"76th book for 2018.I hate it when books don't deliver on their titles. I was expecting a brief history of everyone who lived. Spoiler: Didn't happen. Various chapters are devoted to the authors own pet peeves like how genetics is misrepresented in the media. A much better book, which at least lives up to it's title, is Robert David Reich's ""Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the new science of the human past"". Topics about genetics and behavior and the effects of environment on gene expression are covered in a far more nuanced fashion in ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert Sapolsky.While it was only a small part of the book: I found his discussion of color vision (as an ex-vision scientist) annoying. He completely misrepresents how color vision works: We don't have ""three-color vision"" (whatever that means - we do see FOUR pure colors); this is not because we have 3-cones classes (three colors) - for instance, if we had 4-cone classes we wouldn't see four colors). His discussion of tetrachromacy (which occurs in about 50% of women) is an interesting story, which he fails to explain in any real way, which is a shame as the genetics is interesting. His complete failure to explain color vision makes me wonder what other errors are in the book.2-stars."
6,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"Genetic research has boomed in the last 30 years. A provisional highlight was the description of the human genome (an overview of the genetic code of our species) in 2003. But naturally science has not stood still since then. Nowadays, not a day goes by without spectacular discoveries or breakthroughs reported by geneticists in their research, for instance on diseases. This book by Adam Rutherford, a publicist with a background in evolutionary genetics, gives a comprehensive state of affairs at the time of the publication of this book, in 2016, now already 4 years ago. Not an easy task, because genetics turns out to be a lot more complicated than you might think. Rutherford therefore proceeds in small steps, and regularly follows side paths in which he occasionally explores certain technical aspects. That makes this book a bit elobarate at times, but in the end you get a very informative picture.A selection of some interesting tidbits. That mankind has barely 20,000 genes, much less than expected, and less than, for example, a banana or a grain of rice. That the Human Genome Project only gave a limited reading of human genetics and that there still are whole areas in the human genome of which we do not know exactly what function they have. That there are virtually no diseases that can be attributed to a single gene, on the contrary, that it seems that different pieces of genetic material are involved in all possible phenomena (negative and positive). That it certainly makes no sense to claim that phenomena such as criminal behaviour, intelligence, sexual orientation, etc. can be attributed to a particular gene. And also important, that the companies that offer a reading of your genetic ""family tree"" are in most cases charlatans, digging up generalities.But Rutherford offers much more than those tidbits. He also addresses thorny issues such as whether the concept of race has a genetic basis, he explores the nature/nurture debate, and sketches how human evolution still is going on. And of course, he disproves the bullshit spread by creationists. But what is particularly striking is his highly reasoned and nuanced defence of the scientific approach, in small steps, with word and reply in full transparency, and with attention to the limitations of the scientific method.Some minor drawbacks: occasionally Rutherford is very wordy and he likes to incorporate anecdotes in his account, improving the readability, but sometimes distracting from the essence. This book also is quite Britain-oriented, citing mostly British studies, and focussing on studies of British subjects. But all in all, I really enjoyed reading this.For the genetic research on the earliest human species, see my review of this book in my History account on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
7,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,0,"'For every complicated problem there is a solution that is simple, direct, understandable, and wrong.' (H.L. Mencken)And Biology is complex. I see that it took nearly three months for me to read this. My sincere apologies to Adam Rutherford, for that length of time might constitute a reflection on his ability to engage, entertain, inform and delight. Not so, not so. I'm not sure why this stayed on my currently reading table for quite so long, because it is actually utterly fascinating. And not daunting at all, even to the biologically illiterate (moi). Mr. Rutherford has an excellent technique of finding relatable analogies to the complexity of genome mapping, frequently using letters, words, sentences as his vehicle to make DNA understandable, and cutting down false analogies on the way, the ones that only relate one complex incomprehensible concept to another, equally unknown quantity. I was never confused, and there's a particularly useful glossary at the back so that I could go and check (yet again) what an allele is, or an SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism in case you were wondering). 'Popular science'. That sounds dismissive. How about: clear, coherent science. Plus added humour."
8,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7279385-katy,3,"It is really difficult for me to articulate my feelings after I had read this book. I found this book fascinating in the first half which focused on what genes can tell us about the origin of our species, especially the bits discussing the evidence found in the genome of ancient remains. The tone was very humorous and quite sarcastic and it was just a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the second half focusing on race and where the actual science is heading in relation to the study of the human genome, was a bit yawn inducing.Adam Rutherford’s writing style felt quite jumbled at times and read like a stream of consciousness almost which felt odd. In my opinion, this book could have been just a tad more accessible and not bogged down with so much scantily explained jargon, the glossary also felt like an afterthought. I didn’t really feel there was a point to the book by the end. So in summary, this book starts off interesting and strong but gradually peters out by the end where I was on the verge of losing interest entirely. Still an interesting read though and I think it’s worth it."
9,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,4,"National Book Critics Circle Award Longlist for Nonfiction 2017. It has been roughly 15 years since the Human Genome Project determined that humans have about 20,000 genes. Surprisingly, this is less than either the roundworm or even a grain of rice. Everyone associated with the Project predicted thousands more—but they were wrong. Rutherford reports on the limits of what genes can tell us about ourselves. While they have helped us to understand the causes of some diseases; they have not helped us to eradicate or cure them.The science writer/geneticist points out that the modern human genome began in Africa around 300,000 years ago and developed web-like as ancient hominins coalesced into a single species. Further, genetic research has shown that race is not identifiable in the genome. Indeed, gene research has shown that a Namibian and a Nigerian have more genetic similarities with a Swede than they do each other. “Genetics has shown that people are different and these differences cluster according to geography and culture but never in a way that aligns with the traditional concepts of human races.”Rutherford takes issue with the brash marketing claims of some DNA companies that suggest they can identify ancestry lineage down to a specific Native American tribe. Such precision is just not possible. And health claims are just as shaky. For example, the gene marker associated with Alzheimer’s does not ensure they will get the disease. Nor does the absence of the gene marker protect them.Recommend this gene overview by the popular science writer."

The author does a great job rounding up exactly what makes us, humans, unique and at the same time homogeneous. My favourite sections were of course on our relation to other species of Hominids and the failed attempts by some scientists to show correlation between genetics and predisposal to criminal behaviour. Written in an accessible language, this work will be a fine compliment to The Gene: An Intimate History."
11,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"Science books can sometimes be rather stuffy or prissy - but no one can accuse Adam Rutherford of this. In his exploration of 'the stories in our genes' that word 'stories' is foremost - and Rutherford proves himself time and again to be an accomplished storyteller. His style is sometimes extremely colloquial (and very British) - so at one point, when referring to the way some people react to the smell of a particular steroid he says 'to many it honks like stale urine' and rather than say 'what really interests me' he is likely to remark 'what turns me on'. I love the many meanders that Rutherford takes along the way, whether it's the horrendously inbred family tree of the Hapsburgs resulting in the sad case of Charles II, or the unique genetic laboratory provided by the small and relatively isolated population of Iceland. Rutherford is at his best when exploring an apparently trivial but genuinely interesting topic like variations in earwax type. This is dependent on a single gene and his exploration of its distribution across the world is delightful. This kind of material brings a lot of QI appeal to the book.Though there is coverage of that 'everyone who every lived', for the UK reader there is lots specific to our origins and how groupings we tend to make don't necessarily make any sense genetically. For instance, Rutherford points out that Scottish Celts are more different from Welsh Celts than either are from the English. There's also plenty of delving into the past, from the latest version of Out of Africa to our relationship (literally) with Neanderthals. Darwin, as you might imagine, features quite a lot. I'd say that Rutherford rather overdoes the Darwin fandom, calling him 'the greatest of all scientists across all disciplines.' I certainly don't want to do Darwin down, as he certainly made a great contribution, but as the work of Wallace and others show, his ideas were very much in the air, so if you really want to make the invidious comparison of scientists this way I'd be inclined to say someone like Einstein, who with general relativity came up with something that really came out of the blue, probably should be ranked higher.What begins with a genetic exploration of early humans takes us into all kinds of genetic adventures (including a section where Rutherford crushes a pathetic attempt to identify Jack the Ripper that was scientifically full of holes). While I'd recommend reading Henry Gee's The Accidental Species as well for more of the paleontology of early humans, and the evolutionary considerations of our ending up the way we have, Rutherford makes humankind's genetic origins and identity his own. Mostly the book is hard to fault. Sometimes it felt just a bit too unstructured - jumping all over the place in the manner of an over-excited mountain goat. And the final two main chapters lacked some of the engagement of the others. There was a fascinating section on the worrying legal cases where the defence has been ‘my genes made me do it’, but that apart, there’s an awful lot at the specific gene level, whether it’s the ins and outs of the Human Genome Project or the relationship of genes and diseases, and after a while, to the non-biologist, this got a bit samey. Having said that, it’s hard to see how Rutherford could have written the book without these chapters and overall it’s a magnificent achievement, a big, friendly bear of a book that pummels the reader with delightful stories and no doubt would buy you a drink if it could. I can’t help but wonder if the cover was deliberately designed to pick up DNA - it has become far more marked than any book I can ever remember reading - if it was, it wouldn’t surprise me because Rutherford fills his book with clever little detail like this. Either way, it’s a fantastic popular science read."

The human genome was first laid bare in 2003 or so, and since then a lot has happened. However, this books makes abundantly clear that complex human behavior cannot be explained by genes alone. It is not ""nature versus nurture"" but ""nature via nurture"". The books also picks apart our definition of race, the ones that are based on how we look. It is fairly meaningless since there are more differences in the genes within ""racial"" groups than between. The most genetic variation in human being is found in Africa. The rest of us are descended from the narrow pool of genes carried by the people who left that continent. This is a very good introduction to the field of genetics, which will help you automatically realize that many of the headlines referring to new-found genes are more founded on the wish to sell papers and get clicks, than on real science. The author is incredibly funny, so this is not dry. Some parts are quite technical, but for most part, this is definitely aimed at lay persons. Definitely recommended."

The book is at least two drafts away from being ready for publication. It reads as if dictated by a busy, distracted, garrulous man bent on clearing his calendar for a more interesting and important project. Disorganized. Poorly edited. Thin.

14,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"There is no gene for evil. Black people have no genetic predisposition to excel at sports. Tay-Sachs is not a Jewish disease. Native Americans are not genetically predisposed to alcoholism. And, of course, there is no such thing as a “race” in genetics. These are a few of the many axes Adam Rutherford grinds in his ambitious new book, A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes.Rutherford's book consists of two parts. Part One, “How We Came to Be,” lives up to the title for the most part. He outlines the emergence of Homo sapiens as the sole survivor of several human species. (All members of the genus Homo are human. This includes Neanderthals, Denisovans, Homo erectus, and an as yet unknown number of other species.) Using the latest findings from genetic research, the author traces the movements of various human populations over 200,000 years since the first anatomically modern human walked the Earth. Rutherford emphasizes that the patterns of migration were far more complex than earlier studies have led us to believe—and interbreeding among human species far more extensive.In Part Two, “Who We Are Now,” Rutherford departs from the promise of the title to survey the findings of genetic research about some of the many popular misconceptions about race and genetics. Here are a few highlights:Are African-Americans uniquely well-suited to play basketball? Not so, he writes. “The Dutch are the tallest people on average on Earth, and I have little doubt that if there were similar numbers of Dutch people as there are Americans, and basketball were as culturally important and ubiquitous, then they would produce teams as good as the LA Lakers.”Do some people commit awful crimes because their genes program them to do so? “No one will ever find a gene for ‘evil,’ or for beauty, or for musical genius, or for scientific genius, because they don’t exist. DNA is not destiny.”What about that “Jewish disease” Tay-Sachs? “Tay-Sachs . . . is seen at roughly the same frequency in Cajuns in Louisiana, and French Canadians in Quebec. There is no such thing as a Jewish disease, because Jews are not a genetically distinct group of people.”What about race? The visible differences between, say, East Asians and Africans suggest that races are real, don’t they? Well, no. Not at all. As Rutherford makes clear, “certain genetic groupings do roughly correspond to geography. But not exclusively, and not essentially.” There is, in fact, no such thing as “race” in genetics. “Eighty-five percent of human variation, according to the genetic differences in blood groups,” Rutherford writes, “was seen in the same racial groups. Of the remaining 15 percent, only 8 percent accounted for differences between one racial group and another.” In other words, those visible differences among the races are trivial from a genetic perspective. The genetic differences among any two Africans from different parts of the continent are almost certainly greater than the differences between either of them and a pale, blond, blue-eyed Scandinavian. This should be obvious to anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of genetics, Rutherford suggests. When Homo sapiens began migrating out of Africa and radiating around the world, only small groups left the motherland. The genetic diversity among them was immeasurably smaller than that of the much larger numbers they left behind.The author explains at length that the Human Genome Project did not decode the whole genome. In fact, more than 98 percent of the three billion letters on the genome do not encode for proteins, which is the primary function of genes. These non-coding letters have been given the unfortunate and misleading name of “junk DNA.” Many do have discernible and important functions. But the function of most junk DNA is not understood.Scientists are in the very earliest stages of tapping the power of genetics to address disease. As of now, “the number of diseases that have been eradicated as a result of our knowing the genome? Zero. The number of diseases that have been cured as a result of gene therapy? Zero.” The Human Genome Project was a beginning, not an end. Today, “DNA is used routinely in the diagnosis of dozens of cancers, of heart arrhythmias, in identifying the causes of thousands of diseases too rare to have historically warranted major research projects.” But science today is merely scratching the surface of this potential.Rutherford clearly knows his stuff. But he’s far from infallible. He’s dismissive of linguistic studies that inform our understanding of prehistorical migration patterns. Why? He doesn’t explain. He’s inconsistent about the number of years when Homo sapiens first entered the Americas, citing numbers all the way from 12,000 years to more than 24,000. He refers on numerous occasions to findings from the for-profit companies 23andme and BritainsDNA, both of which provide genetic profiles to individuals for a price. But he fails to mention the National Geographic Genographic Project, which predates them both and now encompasses genetic records from more than 800,000 people. And he first states that individuals from different species can't mate and produce fertile offspring, then fails to explain how Homo sapiens and Neanderthals together produced so many of the rest of us.British geneticist and broadcaster Adam Rutherford is a former editor of the journal Nature. He hosts the BBC Radio 4 program Inside Science."
15,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49703994-raquel,5," Mini review in English / Reseña completa en español It must not be easy to write about the story in our genes, the genes of humankind, in a very accesible, highly gripping way, full of delightful (british) humour (and nerdy references!). Yet in A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived, Adam Rutherford achieves it, and makes you feel passionate about it. Along a very ingenious drawn narration, from the beginning to the present, he touches such sensible topics as endogamy, racism (really impressive chapter), and debunks myths such as ""the gene of evil"" brilliantly. His message is clear: reality (and therefore, science) isn't as simplistic as some want to sell, but it's much more interesting.Fascinating. I really can't recommend it enough, you'll learn a lot. Even though it is brief, I must admit I had never thought I'd finish it in only one week. ESP No creo que sea nada sencillo escribir sobre la historia que relatan nuestros genes, la historia del ser humano desde un punto de vista científico, de una manera clara, muy accesible (lo prometo), muy amena y con un fino (y muy británico) sentido del humor (con referencias literarias y de la cultura popular que se agradecen). Pero Adam Rutherford consigue mucho más que eso. Transmite (y contagia) además su pasión.A lo largo de una narración ingeniosamente hilada, comenzando por los orígenes de la humanidad de mano de la paleontología, pasando por la Edad Media Europea hasta una increíble reflexión sobre nuestro futuro, el autor trata temas tan sensibles como la endogamia, el racismo (impresionante este capítulo), la eugenesia, o desmonta mitos como el ""gen de la maldad"" de forma brillante. Creo que existen tres cuestiones fundamentales sobre las que pivota este relato de nuestra historia: - Sexo: lo que siempre lo complicado todo, desde tiempos inmemoriables. El homo sapiens ha practicado *mucho* sexo, lo que no solo hace inconsistente cualquier intento de clasificarnos racialmente, sino que incluso ha desdibujado el concepto del ser humano como especie, tal y como se entendía hasta hace bien poco.- Ego: es una cuestión recurrente a lo largo de todo este relato (y por supuesto de la humanidad). Al ser humano le fascina el ser humano. Y si bien la curiosidad es aquello que nos define, lo que nos hace ""humanos"", también es un arma de doble filo del que se aprovecharán empresas para lucrarse a base de vender pseudociencia, o cobrarte un buen dinero por un sinsentido de test genético.- Poder: si unes el ansia por la perpetuación en el poder con el sexo, tendrás endogamia (véase el capítulo dedicado a las monarquías europeas...). Y si unes poder con ego, tendrás algo más perverso aún: el racismo como institución, la búsqueda en la ciencia de la legitimación de la supremacía blanca.Y en épocas más recientes se le suma el hambre de los medios por el titular fácil, la guerra por los clicks que tienen como consecuencia titulares sensacionalistas, con explicaciones científicas mal explicadas cuando no completamente érroneas, que poco ayudan a acabar con falsos mitos sobre la genética y el determinismo biológico. El mensaje es claro: la realidad (y con ello la ciencia) nunca es tan simplista como algunos nos quieren vender, pero es muchísimo más interesante.  ""Deberíamos tener cuidado de aprender y entender las cosas, de estar tan al día como sea posible, de no vivir apabullados por mitos y equívocos. (...) Perpetuamos mitos aferrándonos a explicaciones simples, sin sumergirnos en la extraordinaria complejidad de lo que significa ser humano."" No esperaba leerlo en tan solo una semana. Una lectura fascinante. No apto para aquellos que busquen una ""teoría del todo"". Recomendadísimo para todos los demás.  Sobre la edición:  Fantástica edición y traducción de la editorial Pasado y Presente. Es raro que prefiera la portada española, pero si al hecho de que me parece más inteligente usar un plano de metro como representación del entramado ""árbol"" de la humanidad, añades a la familia Weasley, me matas."
16,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"There are two parts to this book. The first “How We Came to Be”, looks at the genetic evidence around human evolution. It touches on Neanderthals, Denisovans and Flores Man (DNA can’t be recovered from earlier species) before looking at the evolution of modern H. sapiens. It also covers the timescale under which an individual’s family history will intersect with those of everyone else, and it’s probably put me off ever trying to use one of those commercial companies who promise to reveal your ancestry via your DNA (something that I had thought about, I must admit).I thought Part I was excellent. Part II, “Who We Are Now” is a slight drier read but still has plenty to recommend it. There are too many themes to summarise, but I think the author most wants to convey the message that there is never a single gene that explains any aspect of personality or behaviour. Genes do not act in isolation of one another, and all act in concert with environmental influences. “It’s a lot more complicated than you think” would be a one-line summary.There’s quite a lot of humour in the book, no doubt included in a conscious attempt to retain the interest of the general reader. For me it mostly fell flat. One or two references made me smile but on the whole I found the humour a bit forced.As the author acknowledges, this is a field where new discoveries are being made all the time. It probably won’t be too many years before the book is out of date. In the meantime, this is an excellent overview for the layman."
17,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,A very interesting read on genetics and the common mistakes that people make when thinking about DNA and its role in human life. Filled with fun trivia information about the subject and weaved together with historical backgrounds on big personalities in the sciences or areas of research that we should all be familiar with. Worth the read. 
18,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43701117-albert-norton,2,"I picked up this book because I had in mind to get current (as a layman) on the state of DNA research, after hearing so much hoopla about mapping of the human genome some years ago. The epiphanies I hoped for never arrived. That's not entirely Rutherford's fault. As he points out in the book, it's a complex subject, and ancestry-mapping is not the main point, there are bigger fish to fry, like treating or curing inherited disease. Still, DNA research tells us a lot, but most of what Rutherford relates you probably know intuitively. Rutherford explains, genetically, lactose intolerance, which is of interest to me. He explains that, contrary to a report a few years ago in the UK, redheads will not go extinct. There is more genetic variation among members of the same race, than among two randomly-chosen people of two races. Somewhat interesting. Lots of anecdotal explanations, which are really not the state-of-the-art, but rather corrections of common misunderstandings.One interesting insight is a mathematical understanding of how our ancestry works. Rutherford explains how, for example, it is actually true that nearly everyone with any European ancestry is related to the great Charlemagne. As you trace your tree back up the generations, you very quickly get to overlaps, to the point that our ancestry is one great network, rather than an ever-dwindling step-down of branches into the main trunk, which is you. For this reason, Rutherford explains, it is possible to pinpoint to a mere 3600 years ago the most recent date on which there was a single common ancestor of everyone now alive. I was disappointed with this book because I felt I came away with very little that was new, even for someone like me not routinely immersed in the study of genetics or ancestry. I admit, though, that I might have a more charitable attitude toward Rutherford, if he had a more charitable attitude toward those with whom he disagrees. Here's what he has to say about people who don't buy entirely into the non-teleological, naturalist version of evolution as the explanation of all biological development and of the first life as well. Early in his book he talks over his glasses at us thusly: ""Nowadays, only the willfully ignorant dismiss the truth that we evolved from earlier ancestors."" So much for critical thinking. ""[C]reationism,"" he says, is ""frothing with risible fallacies."" Creationists are ""dolts."" They make ""zombie arguments."" Ambiguously, either the creationists or their arguments are ""unthinking and mindless, tired and drooling, relentlessly shuffling along, impervious to reason, intelligence or debate, and desperately ugly."" Rutherford doesn't prove naturalistic evolution nor deal with any objections to it, before going straight to name-calling. He doesn't do that because he worships Darwin, and gives no indication of having ever heard of a teleological version of biological evolution. Though this book isn't mainly about Darwin or about evolution, Rutherford gushes his idolatrous admiration. Darwin is a ""star,"" a ""genius,"" ""the greatest of all scientists,"" ""at the very top of the intellectual pile."" Fine. Everyone has heroes. But I think there is one person Rutherford admires even more: himself. His smugness gets old fast, and detracts from what might otherwise be a diverting if superficial stroll through contemporary thinking on genetics."
19,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,3,"The title of this book is a bit misleading: in the first part Rutherford does indeed give a good overview of the evolutionary history of the human species (""a history of everyone who ever lived""), but thereafter he mainly gives a state of the art of genetic research in general, with everything what is involved. The first part was the main reason why I read this book, so in this review I will only go into that part.Classic archeology has ruled the domain of earliest human history for over 150 years, since the discovery of Neanderthal bones in a cave near Düsseldorf, Germany. In the 1950s the field of action shifted to Eastern and Southern Africa, gradually drawing up a family tree of human and pre-human species, like for instance Australopithecus or Homo Erectus. This family tree had to be revised approximately every 10 years or so, following the discovery of new, older fossils or the application of new dating methods. This was sometimes accompanied by unscientific methodologies and fierce infight between archaeologists, but that is not the subject of this book.From the 1990s onwards, genetics has put this pedigree model under intense pressure. An ever-better understanding of the DNA and especially the human genome (the entirety of the genetic code of man) made it possible to date human remains much more accurately and, above all, to establish almost unambiguous connections or distinctions between and within human species. For a while it seemed that now was offered a methodology that for once and for all could put an end to the endless disputes amongst archeologists and paleontologists. But then it turned out that the picture was much more complicated than expected. For instance, take the study of Neandertal people, which we know disappeared about 30,000 years ago. Study of the genetic material of our Sapiens species has unequivocally shown that it also contains typical Neandertal material, on average for about 2.5%. In other words, Neandertal and Sapiens interbred (in fact in several interconnecting 'waves'), so that you can say that though Neandertal is a dead-end branch of the human species, nevertheless he lives on in us (especially Europeans and East-Asians)! The same phenomenon is established with those curious other representatives of the ""homo genus"": the Denisova and the Floriensis. Rutherford rightly concludes: ""the ancient genomes awaiting discovery will show that the world was much more cosmopolitan in the millennia before we became the last representative of the homo genus"". And: ""It's now clearer than ever. that the old, simplistic view of how we became what we are is simply not correct. Gone are the days of neatly branched trees, of the bent monkey walking upright step by step”.Nice, but what did surprise me is that this spectacular evolution in genetic research is also subject to its own limitations. For example, almost all genetic research is focussed on the analysis of 'mitrochondrial DNA', that's a part of the genetic code that is situated outside of the cell nucleus, and it is easier to 'read' than the very long DNA-strings within the nucleus. Now this 'mitrochondrial DNA' is only transmitted to a next generation by the mother (the father has his own unique 'parcel', the well-known Y-chromosome). Limiting research to this part has the advantage of enabling a much faster analysis and establishing clear lines of connections and distinctions. But nevertheless, can we really be sure that this is a reliable method that gives us the whole picture? Of course, I'm a layman in these affairs, but once again it seems science is taking the path of segmentation, risking reductionism.Another limitation: apparantly it is not possible to extract DNA from species older than 100-50,000 years: the DNA in the fossil remains has almost always completely disintegrated, due to heat and moisture. The oldest complete genome of a sapiens is only 45,000 years old (at least it was the year this book was published, in 2016). In other words: for the time being, genetic research does not tell us everything about the earliest history of mankind, and especially about its predecessors, the australopithicus or the homo erectus of which we have found lots of fossils, not useful to genetic research. Only indirectly some data can be retrieved, by specifically looking at the quantity and diversity of mutations detectable within the 'modern' DNA, and establishing how many generations ago a certain mutation took root in a certain population or species. So, up until now, most of the gains of genetic research are within the history of Homo Sapiens itself. For instance, genetics has been able to map the migration waves of the Sapiens in a much better and more reliable way than classic archeology. But once again the answers are not completely unambiguous: genetic research confirms that agriculture certainly came to Europe via migration flows (a first wave from about 9,700-7,000 BP, and a second much larger one after 5,000 BP), but that too was accompanied by a considerable mixing with the local hunter-gatherer population, making it difficult to answer the classic question whether hunter-gatherers were expelled and annihilated by farmers, or adopted farming methods and were integrated in the farming population. Rutherford makes it clear that genetic research does provide us with a lot of new insights, but at the same time confronts us with a lot of new questions. Almost every door that is opened leads to new branching paths. In other words, genetic research does not provide all the answers, although Rutherford is convinced that science will continue to make progress and unravel more and more mysteries. Only time can tell."
20,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james,4,"‘A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived’ (2016) by Adam Rutherford – is a fascinating and largely compelling popular science introduction to the world and history of human genetics and genomics. Rutherford takes us on a journey – one which is all about our shared human history, as viewed through the lens of genetics and which Rutherford split into two parts:1.	How we came to be2.	Who we are now ‘Brief History’ is an amazing journey whichever way it’s viewed and takes us from the very origins of humans (moreover our genetic pre-homosapien ancestors) in Africa, through the 'Out of Africa' migration and beyond; from the very beginnings of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution and natural selection; through Crick and Watson’s discovery of DNA, all the way to today’s cutting edge scientific research – taking in all manner of fascinating things along the way, such as the exhumation and positive identification of Richard III from his unmarked grave beneath a car park in Leicester, to the myths surrounding the so-called positive identification of ‘Jack the Ripper’.Rutherford’s book – whether for the scientist and non-scientist alike, is an engaging and thought-provoking history, in which Rutherford successfully and very easily debunks so many of the quasi-scientific and media promoted myths concerning genetics (‘redheads to become extinct?’) and provides the reader with a largely accessible account of our history interlinked with the history, findings and developments within the science of human genetics.As very much a non-scientist, I cannot pretend to fully understand all of the ideas and concepts outlined in ‘Brief History’ – nevertheless Rutherford’s book, whilst very occasionally verging on the esoteric, is neither patronising nor impenetrable. Moreover, Rutherford provides us with a fascinating, thought-provoking book concerning our amazing shared history – an inspired and inspiring read. "
21,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy,2,"The trouble with popular science books is that at some point they have to get down and dirty with real hard science, and however hard the author tries, and however skilled he is at making the difficult accessible, that’s one big stumbling block for the non-scientists out there. I so wanted to be more engaged with this book. Genetics is important, right? We need to understand the subject. It explains our past and informs out future. Adam Rutherford has no doubt done his best, but his best just isn’t good enough. The book is so long-winded, muddled and rambling that the science gets lost along the way. A few anecdotes do not a good science book make. And it seems (though I am not qualified to judge) that he makes quite a few mistakes and misinterprets the data on more than one occasion. I can’t comment on that but I didn’t feel that I came away from struggling through the book with any clear idea of what he was actually saying. There are some interesting nuggets here, for sure, but they get lost in all those words. A brave, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt at making genetics clear for the layman. "
22,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,3,"A lot of interesting information, but a bit of a slog due to repetition. He's covering a huge swath of time & geography. That's difficult & he managed to break it up fairly well as is shown in the table of contents below. It is a credible effort, but it had problems throughout. Well narrated & I can cautiously recommend reading this, but I've certainly read better books on genes & human history. 3.5 stars rounded down because his bias is just too obvious.He bent the facts to fit his agenda a bit too often. He makes a big deal out of the math which shows that the genetic variance within a race is greater than between races however they're defined. (I had no idea there were so many!) He points out how much harm these ideas have caused in great detail (Agreed!) & he takes Nicholas Wade to task generally for his ideas in this area, but never meets any of them head on & avoids how often they work well in real life. For instance, he never pointed out just how the 3 major race idea works in a field like forensics (bodies are often identified by race due to bone structure differences) & medical treatments/issues since that would have undercut his argument badly.His discussion of Darwin's cousin Galton is another example of pretty good with gaping holes. Galton was a 'great' man, both for good & ill, which Rutherford makes clear. He mentions Roosevelt, Churchill, & Stopes, but didn't mention Margaret Sanger or Madison Grant (Bronx Zoo, Bison Society, & a couple of parks). Perhaps that's because he's from the UK, but he also ignored the role Galton's eugenics ideas had in forming the modern conservation & ecological movements. Sanger's efforts led to Planned Parenthood while Grant's book went on to become Hitler's bible. Vogt, the father of the modern ecology movement & a director of PP, coupled Galton's ideas with those of Malthus. Maybe all that would have been too much of a tangle, but I find it fascinating how such great ideas & intentions went so right & wrong. He could & should have found room for this, but he spent too much time repetitiously hammering his point home.That last sentence pretty much sums up the book: good points that are repetitiously hammered into the reader at the expense of full exploration of the topic. He obviously knows his field & his explanations into just how complex & far reaching minor genetic changes can be are excellent, but his focused PC bias is tough to take at times.Table of ContentsIntroductionPART ONE: HOW WE CAME TO BE1: Horny and mobile2: The first European union3: When we were kingsi: The king lives onii: Richard III, Act VIiii: The king is dead . . .PART TWO: WHO WE ARE NOW4: The end of race5: The most wondrous map ever produced by humankind6: Fate7: A short introduction to the future of humankindEpilogue"

Rutherford's answer to this last question is yes. In the end, we are all interrelated because our gene pool working backwards was rather small. For example, 23andMe tells me I am related to Marie Antoinette. Rutherford suggests holding off on claiming royal property and privilege because so are millions of other people.Homo sapiens emerged from Africa at least years ago. Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other hominids were already inhabiting the places they wandered. The evidence in our DNA suggests that our ancestors mated with them. Oddly, it was male Homo sapiens who mated with female Neanderthals. The fact that mating occurred calls into question the labeling of Neanderthals and Denisovans as other species of human. By definition, a species is made up of organisms capable of mating and producing offspring. So either we need to patch up the definition of species or welcome Neanderthals into the human species. One of the most fascinating sections of the book was the chapter on race because it examines differences in the genome and concludes that there is no genetic basis for race. Variation is endemic to genetics because every human will have about 100 genetic changes out of about 3 billion. These mutations are largely inconsequential but those that are adaptive to the population's environment will spread. So Africans have developed more melanin pigment in their skin to screen out the strong sun. Scandinavians have developed lighter skin and hair pigmentation to absorb more sun in less sunny climates. However, the variation between the African's genome and the Scandinavian's genome other than coding for melanin are inconsequential. Geneticists cannot see race. It is a cultural construct with no basis in science. The chapter on Richard III, dubbed the King in the Car Park, was especially interesting to me, as I followed the story as it was unfolding in the news. Richard III died in battle and his dead body paraded before jeering crowds before being buried unceremoniously in the Greyfriar's cemetery. When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, Greyfriars was transferred to private hands. In recent excavations for a car park, bones were found that were consistent with descriptions of Richard III's death. Geneticists were able to find two individuals related to Richard and confirm the identity of the bones. It was an exciting bit of forensic defective work that Rutherford explains well. Although the writer's style annoyed me at times, this book is well worth reading for its clear explanations of the latest genetic research (up to 2016) and how to interpret it. I was disappointed in its failure to incorporate some of the latest work on epigenetics, which he mentions only in passing. Some readers may find the more technical explanations challenging. It took me a few weeks to absorb the book, but it was well worth the time. "

One example""By asking how recently the people of Europe would have a common ancestor, he constructed a mathematical model that incorporated the number of ancestors an individual is presumed to have had (each with two parents), and given the current population size, the point at which all those possible lines of ascent up the family trees would cross. The answer was merely 600 years ago. Sometime at the end of the thirteenth century lived a man or woman from whom all Europeans could trace ancestry, if records permitted (which they don’t). If this sounds unlikely or weird, remember this individual is one of thousands of lines of descent that you and everyone else has at this moment in time, and whoever this unknown individual was, they represent a tiny proportion of your total familial webbed pedigree. But if we could document the total family tree of everyone alive back through 600 years, among the impenetrable mess, everyone European alive would be able to select a line that would cross everyone else’s around the time of Richard II.All lines of European ancestry coalesce on every individual in the tenth century.Chang factored that into a further study of common ancestry beyond Europe, and concluded in 2003 that the most recent common ancestor of everyone alive today on Earth lived only around 3,400 years ago.""What I would like to you is if anyone watches thishttps://www.facebook.com/JayShettyIW/...And reads the book what they make of video in light of the book.Great stuff!"

29,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine,4,"This was a slow but compelling read. (The slowness mostly arose from the fact that this book requires a certain amount of mental acuity; I couldn’t read it before bed, for example, and actually retain any of the information I read.) Part of what’s compelling here is simply the science: the field of human genetics is advancing so quickly, in so many directions, that every month brings new and fascinating studies. And it’s such a widespread field that it’s hard to keep up with it unless that’s your job, so it’s nice to have a book that tries to sum it all up. Part of what’s compelling is the writing style. Rutherford writes complicated information fairly lucidly, and keeps things light and jargon-free. He is rather repetitive, though; I kept reading things in various chapters and going, “Yeah, I know, because you told me two chapters ago.” I’m not sure if that’s a bug born of a long writing time and a complex topic, or a feature intended for people who read only a chapter of the book, or who go a long time in between chapters. Either way, it was a bit disconcerting. My only real complaint about this book, though, is that it seems extremely weird to have a conventionally published *book* on a topic that’s evolving (hee) as quickly as human genetics is. This book is already out of date. It will be more out of date next year. (Except, of course, for the bits that tell you how to *think* about genetics, how to evaluate claims about genetics — that stuff will stay useful for a good long time.) I guess my advice is: if you’re looking for a good snapshot of the science of human genes, this is a good place to go, and you should read it ASAP, because pretty soon it won’t be anymore. "
30,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"It’s an ambitious title, and it should come as no surprise that that’s not really a history of everyone who ever lived. It’s really a story about some of the things we know from our genes, and it’s a bit of a random sampling at that, covering ear wax (those who have studied genetics will find this no-shocker, since wet vs sticky earwax is a fairly common example of a certain kind of genetic trait), kings, disease, migration, redheads, and all kinds of things in between. To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

One theme is the limitation of what genes can tell us about humanity. We still have a surprising amount in common with our Neanderthal ancestors. The writing is serviceable, with nods to Charles Darwin and T.S. Eliot at the end. More typos than usual for a traditionally published book.

To put this in perspective, a banana has 36,000... The first complete draft of the sequence was published on February 12th 2001. Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."
33,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"[10 Jul 2020]I enjoyed this book but was also frustrated by it. I couldn't quite figure out what the main point of the book was. Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

It covers all the interesting things we want to know....I didn't understand all of it. The book is a wild mix of the vernacular and the scientific. Much was like this:""Red hair appearing exclusively in beards in not uncommon, though we don't really know why. Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions. Skin color is one. The ability to digest milk is another....""""Earwax is of great interest to people like me....We like it because it's one of a very small handful of traits that has a relatively straightforward relationship between the DNA and its outcome....""And so I, reluctantly at first and then compulsively for the rest of the afternoon, I read on.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

Topics covered: future of our genetics, genetic engineering, how DNA works, etc. This is an extensive, fascinating topic that I truly enjoy learning so I've read a few books in this vein and while nothing here was new or groundbreaking, it's good to be reminded."
42,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."
43,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65025104-andrei-balici,3,"The who, the what, the when, the why, and the where...regarding life.This book tries to approach four of the aforementioned terms. We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
45,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
52,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic. Verdict: 3.3/5, but Goodreads won’t allow that, so 3 stars."

There are many interesting facts in the book. For example, genetics can tell you- Homo sapiens share about 3% genes with Neanderthals. - lactose tolerance started somewhere close to Poland- people have only 20,000 genes; less than bananas or round worms. Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

58,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

60,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"It’s an ambitious title, and it should come as no surprise that that’s not really a history of everyone who ever lived. It’s really a story about some of the things we know from our genes, and it’s a bit of a random sampling at that, covering ear wax (those who have studied genetics will find this no-shocker, since wet vs sticky earwax is a fairly common example of a certain kind of genetic trait), kings, disease, migration, redheads, and all kinds of things in between. To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

One theme is the limitation of what genes can tell us about humanity. We still have a surprising amount in common with our Neanderthal ancestors. The writing is serviceable, with nods to Charles Darwin and T.S. Eliot at the end. More typos than usual for a traditionally published book. Interested readers will find better books that cover some of the same subject matter (e.g. by Siddhartha Mukherjee and David Quammen)."

To put this in perspective, a banana has 36,000... The first complete draft of the sequence was published on February 12th 2001. Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."

Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

It covers all the interesting things we want to know....I didn't understand all of it. The book is a wild mix of the vernacular and the scientific. Much was like this:""Red hair appearing exclusively in beards in not uncommon, though we don't really know why. Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions. Skin color is one. The ability to digest milk is another....""""Earwax is of great interest to people like me....We like it because it's one of a very small handful of traits that has a relatively straightforward relationship between the DNA and its outcome....""And so I, reluctantly at first and then compulsively for the rest of the afternoon, I read on.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

72,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
75,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
82,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic.

Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

88,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."

Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high.

On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading.

The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed.

It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
112,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."
113,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is a comprehensive guide to our history through a lens of genetics. It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic. Verdict: 3.3/5, but Goodreads won’t allow that, so 3 stars."

There are many interesting facts in the book. For example, genetics can tell you- Homo sapiens share about 3% genes with Neanderthals. - lactose tolerance started somewhere close to Poland- people have only 20,000 genes; less than bananas or round worms. Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

118,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

120,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"It’s an ambitious title, and it should come as no surprise that that’s not really a history of everyone who ever lived. It’s really a story about some of the things we know from our genes, and it’s a bit of a random sampling at that, covering ear wax (those who have studied genetics will find this no-shocker, since wet vs sticky earwax is a fairly common example of a certain kind of genetic trait), kings, disease, migration, redheads, and all kinds of things in between. To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

One theme is the limitation of what genes can tell us about humanity. We still have a surprising amount in common with our Neanderthal ancestors. The writing is serviceable, with nods to Charles Darwin and T.S. Eliot at the end. More typos than usual for a traditionally published book. Interested readers will find better books that cover some of the same subject matter (e.g. by Siddhartha Mukherjee and David Quammen)."

To put this in perspective, a banana has 36,000... The first complete draft of the sequence was published on February 12th 2001. Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."

Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers.""

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high.

On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
135,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

141,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
142,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."
143,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is a comprehensive guide to our history through a lens of genetics. It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic. Verdict: 3.3/5, but Goodreads won’t allow that, so 3 stars."

Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

148,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity.

We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated.

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high.

On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
165,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

171,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
172,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic.

178,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA.

We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers.

First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

192,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."

The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed.

201,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
202,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic.

208,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

It covers all the interesting things we want to know....I didn't understand all of it. The book is a wild mix of the vernacular and the scientific. Much was like this:""Red hair appearing exclusively in beards in not uncommon, though we don't really know why. Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

Topics covered: future of our genetics, genetic engineering, how DNA works, etc. This is an extensive, fascinating topic that I truly enjoy learning so I've read a few books in this vein and while nothing here was new or groundbreaking, it's good to be reminded."
222,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."
223,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65025104-andrei-balici,3,"The who, the what, the when, the why, and the where...regarding life.This book tries to approach four of the aforementioned terms. We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
225,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed.

231,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
232,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic.

238,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

240,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"It’s an ambitious title, and it should come as no surprise that that’s not really a history of everyone who ever lived. It’s really a story about some of the things we know from our genes, and it’s a bit of a random sampling at that, covering ear wax (those who have studied genetics will find this no-shocker, since wet vs sticky earwax is a fairly common example of a certain kind of genetic trait), kings, disease, migration, redheads, and all kinds of things in between. To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

One theme is the limitation of what genes can tell us about humanity. We still have a surprising amount in common with our Neanderthal ancestors. The writing is serviceable, with nods to Charles Darwin and T.S. Eliot at the end. More typos than usual for a traditionally published book. Interested readers will find better books that cover some of the same subject matter (e.g. by Siddhartha Mukherjee and David Quammen)."
242,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Genetically you are unique.However, there is nothing particularly special about being unique if everyone else is…In your 23 base pairs of DNA there are around 20,000 human protein-coding genes. To put this in perspective, a banana has 36,000... The first complete draft of the sequence was published on February 12th 2001. Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."
243,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"[10 Jul 2020]I enjoyed this book but was also frustrated by it. I couldn't quite figure out what the main point of the book was. Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

It covers all the interesting things we want to know....I didn't understand all of it. The book is a wild mix of the vernacular and the scientific. Much was like this:""Red hair appearing exclusively in beards in not uncommon, though we don't really know why. Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions. Skin color is one. The ability to digest milk is another....""""Earwax is of great interest to people like me....We like it because it's one of a very small handful of traits that has a relatively straightforward relationship between the DNA and its outcome....""And so I, reluctantly at first and then compulsively for the rest of the afternoon, I read on.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

Topics covered: future of our genetics, genetic engineering, how DNA works, etc. This is an extensive, fascinating topic that I truly enjoy learning so I've read a few books in this vein and while nothing here was new or groundbreaking, it's good to be reminded."
252,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."
253,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65025104-andrei-balici,3,"The who, the what, the when, the why, and the where...regarding life.This book tries to approach four of the aforementioned terms. We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"
254,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8236096-carina,4,"When I saw the title ""A Brief History"" I didn't quite expect this book to be as long as it is...that said, given it covers a huge portion of the history of humanity (both as we know it and prior) this is, indeed, relatively brief in comparison!Before purchasing this book (during an Amazon offer period so it was very very cheap) I read some reviews both on here and on other sites. A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
255,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

261,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
262,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."
263,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is a comprehensive guide to our history through a lens of genetics. It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."
264,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63096839-wouter,3,"One of those books where the subtitle is a better description of the content than the title. “A brief history of everyone who ever lived” promises to take you on a magical ride throughout human history, but this book is no Sapiens. But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic. Verdict: 3.3/5, but Goodreads won’t allow that, so 3 stars."

There are many interesting facts in the book. For example, genetics can tell you- Homo sapiens share about 3% genes with Neanderthals. - lactose tolerance started somewhere close to Poland- people have only 20,000 genes; less than bananas or round worms. Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

268,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15259224-paul-dibara,5,"Public DNA testing to determine one's ancestral origins and possibly find lost relatives has become something of a fad in recent years. But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."

It’s really a story about some of the things we know from our genes, and it’s a bit of a random sampling at that, covering ear wax (those who have studied genetics will find this no-shocker, since wet vs sticky earwax is a fairly common example of a certain kind of genetic trait), kings, disease, migration, redheads, and all kinds of things in between. To me, it read like a grab bag of interesting facts we know about genetics: yes, the facts are interesting, but a coherent argument leading through a book it is not.Rutherford’s not a bad writer, and he clearly has an eye for a good story, but… first of all, this level of pop-science is a bit too pop for me now, and secondly, it’s a disorganised mess.Originally posted on breathesbooks.com.

One theme is the limitation of what genes can tell us about humanity. We still have a surprising amount in common with our Neanderthal ancestors. The writing is serviceable, with nods to Charles Darwin and T.S. Eliot at the end. More typos than usual for a traditionally published book. Interested readers will find better books that cover some of the same subject matter (e.g. by Siddhartha Mukherjee and David Quammen)."

To put this in perspective, a banana has 36,000... The first complete draft of the sequence was published on February 12th 2001. Being able to read this code of T C G A’s is one thing; being able to understand it is another, and we are nowhere near being able to manipulate it yet either. This code is what makes you, you, but hidden deep within it are the countless secrets of our forefathers and mothers, the history of our species including the echoes of past events. There is even small amounts of Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Denisovan genome intertwined within our homo sapiens DNA. Rutherford takes us on this fascinating journey up and down our collective family trees via the spirals of our DNA. No subject is beyond his gaze, hair and eye colour, to the horrors of eugenics to finding out if a body under a carpark is a deceased monarch or why it seems to be those of European descent are the only ones who can drink milk. There are some amusing parts, such as when he lists just what journalists think that scientists have found the genes for and the genetic peril of being in the Royal family. Given how complicated this subject could have been, and it did occasionally go right over my head, it is written with a refreshing clarity. The anecdotes and stories that are in here add greatly to the book. Thankfully I could understand most of it, which is the principle aim of these books to bring science to the wider audience."

Maybe that genetics/genomics is totally misunderstood by the general public. ""Are we slaves or masters of our genes? We are neither, and it’s a dumb, simplistic question.""Still the author has an engaging, almost conversational style, with occasional dry humor, and he provides much interesting information. Everyone of European descent is descended from Charlemagne. Everyone on earth can trace their family tree to a common ancestor just a few thousand years ago. Most people not of African descent have Neanderthal genes. The Human Genome Project was a huge disappointment because it didn't provide any answers. He has a lot to say about what genomics has discovered and what it hasn't done. He also talks a lot about how science works. ""...science is the opposite of common sense."" ""Being wrong is the backbone of science, ..."" Most of which seems to make eminent sense to me. And all of it is interesting. But I was somehow left feeling a little cheated. It seems a bit diffuse, not clearly organized or targeted. Still I would recommend it to anyone interested in genomics at all."

Reading this book I learned quite a lot of new things that I didn't know. First and for most, it is scientific ( I am sure you are thinking well...duh...just look at the subject matter) but it is more than that. It also has a lot of history wrapped up in it as well, which for me made it a lot less dry than a regular science non fiction book.There was much covered in this book about where we all (mostly) originated in the world. How some of the ladies back then still had an eye for the caveman type (Neanderthals). It talks about Richard III and his identification and about the ludicrous claims of the man who bought the shawl that was supposedly recovered from one of the Ripper's victims and had the Ripper's DNA on it. (All because of an old letter where someone said so) Just think how contaminated any DNA would have been after a 100+ years.There is humour in places in this book too, but it does take it's subject seriously.

It covers all the interesting things we want to know....I didn't understand all of it. The book is a wild mix of the vernacular and the scientific. Much was like this:""Red hair appearing exclusively in beards in not uncommon, though we don't really know why. Forgive us; it's not really been a research priority over the last few decades.""Perfect. Intriguing. Readable. Quotable. I read on.But chunks of it were like this:""The vast majority of Brits, and northern and Western Europeans (including places colonized by them) have a single change, a C becomes a T, around 13,000 letters of DNA before the start of the lactase gene....Thirteen thousand nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the lactase gene is a region that controls its activity, and a mutation in that distant control center accounts for the vast majority of milk drinkers."" I gave up on this book about halfway through the month. Some of it was just tedious, I thought. I got ready to return it to the library today, and, unexpectedly, I got all caught up in it again. ""You are of royal descent, because everyone is.""""The science of genetics was founded specifically on the study of racial inequality, by a racist.""""The unglamorous truth is that there are but a handful of uniquely human traits that we have clearly demonstrated are adaptations evolved to thrive in specific geographical regions. Skin color is one. The ability to digest milk is another....""""Earwax is of great interest to people like me....We like it because it's one of a very small handful of traits that has a relatively straightforward relationship between the DNA and its outcome....""And so I, reluctantly at first and then compulsively for the rest of the afternoon, I read on.

The idea is that you can certainly learn about your recent past because it is likely that many of your ancestors are still in their homeland, giving you a sense of where you came from. But there is no real test to tell you definitively where you came from. In this book, his discussion of ancestry testing wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The rest of the book was just standard stuff. Ever since I finished Creation, which was an amazing book, I could not wait to read another Adam Rutherford book. Maybe my expectations were too high. This was just ok for me. "

282,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120269-bellish,4,"Genes change culture, culture changes genes.This is a fantastic story of what genetics has told us in the past 15 years and what it hasn't. On the one hand it is full of completely surprising assertions. That everyone with European blood is descended from Charlemagne was my favourite (and that wasn't even shown by genetics, but by maths), or how much we were ourselves changed by the development of agriculture. On the other hand, it admirably makes clear the lack of clarity in the vast mass of the human genome and its coding for a massive, fiendishly complicated organism. The Rumsfeld quote about 'known unknowns' was deployed to good use on this, as was an honest explanation of the nature of science (and the meaning of the word 'theory'), which should be repeated as often as possible to the general public.There are also some occasionally beautiful turns of phrase, such as talking about the common ancestor of western Europeans and East Asians representing ""the people who had migrated up from Africa before one group, over thousands of years, turned towards the dawn, while the other one went into the sunset."" I enjoyed the literary references too. So it goes.I was surprised to see somewhat critical reviews on here about the author's treatment of race as I thought this was deal with in pretty short order. He contrasts the small number of superficial differences that we associate with race with the myriad other differences that are hidden beneath and, most movingly, explains just how recently differences like skin tone, hair type and eye folds have turned up, and how much everything else is muddled together:""The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth. We are all cousins, of some degree. I find this pleasing, a warm light for all mankind to share. Our DNA threads through all of us.""It's strangely British-centric in its references, humour and sarcasm. That's fine by me, but an odd choice as it might put off other readers. I will always critique a book that is parochially US-centric, so it seems fair to mention this here also. There was also some more complicated sentences that were clunky and needed editing, which is a shame. Finally, a completly egregious assumption that the reader was of European descent was unnecessary and shouldn't have made it in. Sure, he acknowledged it wasn't a certainty, but it is a certainty some of your readers aren't, so why exclude them?Overall this is an excellent pop science book. I enjoyed it very much with my grounding in biochemistry, because it started with what I knew and then detailed some incredible work that has vastly developed our understanding even in the near 15 years since I left university. I don't think you need to have any understanding of genetics to enjoy it though - as long as you can tolerate the old language-based metaphor."

We don't know exactly why and I am not going to talk about the anthropic principle here. Nevertheless, the lack of the fifth element doesn't make it a bad book. It is a brilliant piece of work and am I thankful that I have been told to read it.The book is divided in two parts: a part dedicated to the topic of how we came to be and a part regarding who are we now. No part is a continuous story, but each is an amalgam of tales, whose purpose is to prove or enforce a point regarding genetics and to eradicate the ultra-simplistic understanding of the absurd complexities of human life.The chapters are somehow organized according to a chronological order of events, because that's the purpose of the book: to talk about the humans and their evolution in the context of passing eons. From the fields of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, when we left the mother continent and headed towards Europe and started breeding with Neanderthals and other Homos, up to the point of Richard III, Charles II of Spain, Darwin and his cousin, Galton and many more, you will be shown a totally different world: the genetic world. I had a great time learning about genes, genetic recombination, ancestry, interbreeding, mutations, diseases, eugenics and many others.You will also learn about the fact that you are of royal descent. The first Holy Roman Emperor is in your ancestry tree! You will even be shown that you have Viking, Saracen, Goth, Hun and Jewish ancestors. Don't get too excited, though, because everybody does. But science has allowed us to discover these simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless and fun facts.I am ashamed to admit that I was an adept of this dogma that genes will dictate your life and what type of personality you will have. I am happy that this book proved me wrong: genes are not fate and you will see why when Rutherford starts talking about heritability. We just simply can't explain such a complex thing as human life in terms of just genes. Of course, they have a saying in the final outcome, but those are merely probabilities, not certain facts.If you haven't fancied biology before, you will do it now, because Rutherford has a colloquial way of explaining how DNA works, why it is important and what it can tell about us and everybody will get to understand his ideas.I gladly recommend this book to everyone!"

A number of those reviews commented on the easy readability of the book given the source material. I would generally disagree, this is a very dense book that has a number of highly interesting segments, but it takes a *lot* of patience and at times a greater scientific knowledge than I have. That said, I still got the general idea of genomes, DNA, hereditary diseases and so on. If you have a keen interest in genes then I think you'd get more out of this than I did.That said, dense-ness aside, I still found this to be an utterly fascinating read. As someone with Welsh, English and German ancestors I now know I am likely to be related to Charlemagne! Pretty awesome ;) I did also look into the AncestryDNA test but I'm not interested enough to pay £70 for the priviledge of spitting in a tube...I read this book predominently on trains and in my lunch break, and the short chunks was a good amount of time to be reading this I think - any longer than 30 minutes and I found I began to tune out and not absorb what I was reading. I think this book would appeal to people with a passing interest in the development of humanity (insofar as our genes go), as well as those with a keen interest in the subject, but it isn't one that I would necessarily recommend to a lot of people."
285,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian,5,"Adam Rutherford's survey of our current understanding of genomics ought to be required reading for policy-makers, educationalists and anyone else who thinks they might know what is best for society, because, as the author repeatedly demonstrates, almost everything we believe we instinctively understand about the heritability of those characteristics we either aspire to, or seek to eliminate, turns out to be wrong. The architecture of the human genome, the subtle interactions between genotype and environment, and the enigmatic role played by epigenetics combine to make genomics one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary science, and one in which the landscape is constantly shifting as technology makes larger sets of data available to us. Rutherford attempts to fill us in on the latest developments and explains why the apparently common-sense responses that so many of us have to news of genetic breakthroughs turn out to be entirely misguided In the process he manages to incorporate plenty of amusing anecdotes. He is particularly entertaining when demolishing the myths peddled by those who have enthusiastically misinterpreted genetic information to further political or commercial interests. The half-truths of racists, ancestry-merchants, creationists and scientifically illiterate journalists are mercilessly exposed. Accessible, absorbing and informative, this is popular science at its best."

291,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"As I finish A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes, the first thing I feel inclined to do is to go back to the beginning and read the whole book over again! This is not for reasons of lack of understanding the first time around. On the contrary, author Adam Rutherford has written an outrageously accessible book for the layperson. The reason to re-read it is that it is so information dense and brimful of rich ideas, that I feel I may not have done justice to this wonderful book with appropriate sustained attention.Up to this point of my understanding of human history, I have belonged to the group that believes it is all about archaeology and geology and fossils and ancient artifacts. And so it is: but now, it is also very much about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the blueprint of instructions that make life. Genetics is the new game in town regarding evolutionary history. It is providing layer upon interesting layer of new information on human evolution, thanks, in part, to the Human Genome Project.The Human Genome Project was completed in the early years of the 21st century. It sought and succeeded in getting a readout of the human genome, all 23 chromosomes and 3 billion letters of it. The good news is that this DNA readout can be mined, not only for information on how humans work, but what happens when “we go wrong.” The readout additionally provides a reference for comparing infinite human similarities and differences, often at the minute genetic level. And since DNA is DNA, it matters not whether it is today’s DNA, or DNA from hundreds, even thousands of years ago. The bones of our ancestors, particularly teeth, handily yield up their DNA for all manner of conclusions to be drawn about “How We Came To Be” and “Who We Are Now,” the two aptly-named halves of Rutherford’s book.This is a fascinating, sweeping narrative of human evolution, and as mountainous as is the volume of information presented, readers cannot help but suspect there is more—a lot more! Hardly a page is without an explanatory footnote, testifying to Rutherford’s thorough research. Occasionally, an idea will require the reader to pause for mental digestion. For example, of the 22 pairs of parent-inherited chromosomes, Rutherford says, “The source of those is everybody you are descended from, mixed and remixed and shuffled and reshuffled every time a sperm or egg was made in one of your millions of ancestors.” Or, that “…for the average geneticist, race simply does not exist,” despite the complex and controversial debate surrounding the topic.But Rutherford’s clear and fluid writing does more than explain and illuminate existing and new ideas. His story accomplishes what must be a desired goal of all nonfiction writers: to spark enough reader interest in the subject matter to create a yearning for more. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes does this with elegant prose and endlessly interesting detail. In my case, not only have I learned more about genetics, I have added biographies of “titans of science” to my reading list: of Charles Darwin and his brilliant theorizing on human evolution; of Francis Galton, Darwin’s polymath half-cousin and significant contributor to science; and of Gregor Mendel, a humble, 19th-century monk, who used peas to chart the rules of inheritance.From his opening, “This is a story about you,” Rutherford will have readers hooked until his closing, “…and as long as there are people our exploring [of the human genome] will never be at an end.”"
292,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I was a bit disappointed in that there was not much here that was new to me, and what was new, or might have been, was presented in such muddy language that it was hard to tell whether he was making a brilliantly nuanced point or no point whatsoever.I knew that Homo sapiens had interbred with Neanderthals, and that about 2.7% of the genome of any European is Neanderthal. I hadn't realized as much about the Denisovans, or that they are likely the source of the variants that make it possible for Sherpas and other high-altitude dwellers to survive there.I hadn't, somehow, realized that humans other than Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalis had lived in Europe, so it was fascinating to learn that someone, likely Homo antecessor, a human that lived between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago, known primarily from caves in the Atapuerca mountains in central Spain, made footprints on the beach in Norfolk 800,000 years ago - that ""Britain has been host to humans for almost a million years"" (96).Sometimes the points he is at great pains to make seem to contradict each other: he says that the Danes, who raped and pillaged and ruled in England from the 800s to the 1100s, left virtually ""no trace"" in the British genome (103). They ""wielded their power from above, absolute Cnuts and Haralds ruling from the top down, with no enduring relations with their subjects."" Huh? That doesn't square with anything we know sociologically, historically, or anthropologically of how human beings interact with each other. Even (especially) when those with power don't officially marry the locals, they still sleep with them, and what genetics traces the history of is not official marriages but actual sex. Maybe he meant there's less *maternal* Danish DNA than one might expect, or so little as to show that they didn't intermarry, but instead just interbred, male Danes with subservient British women, but if that's what he meant, it's what he should have said.Rutherford's overall argument makes even less sense a few pages further on, when he goes to great lengths to argue that, because of gene flow, it makes no sense to use personal DNA testing to argue that one's own personal ancestors were ""Vikings"" or ""Danes"" -- everyone will have genetics from those populations if they are European; in fact, the common European ancestor of every European alive was only about 600 years ago (161). He is also at great pains to make us understand that *all* of us are descended from royalty: ""if you're vaguely of European extraction, you are descended from Charlemagne too"" (160). Now that is fascinating on its own, but it's a completely different point from the one he makes about the Vikings leaving virtually no traces in British DNA. I'm sure there's a distinction here that makes sense -- i.e, how the Vikings can have left no trace in British DNA while at the same time we're all descended from Charlemagne and the most common European ancestor was 600 years ago, while the most recent ancestor of *all* humans is only 3600 years ago -- but Rutherford doesn't make it, and I'm a pretty smart reader with a large existing fund of (lay-level, but still) knowledge on this subject, so if I didn't pick it up, he wasn't doing his job.In fact, he explicitly says, ""You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . "" (165). There is some interesting evolutionary biology/microbial history: that DNA analysis shows that the plague that hit Europe in the 600s was indeed bubonic, and that its source was eastern, not African; thus the steppes, not trade for Egyptian corn.And some of it is just beautiful, and very poetic. He quotes Joseph Chang's statistical findings, ""no matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant slots in the forests of North and South America, and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu."" Rutherford goes on to add, ""We are all special, which also means that none of us is (160). You are of royal descent, because everyone is. You are of Viking descent, because everyone is . . . . It is simultaneously wonderful, trivial, meaningless, and fun (165).If we all have family trees whose roots become severely entangled within a few generations, the Spanish monarchy in the 1600s was a hot mess. Charles II, who had such a complex series of genetic disorders and disabilities that no one now can even disentangle _what_ he had; was, after ten generations, more inbred than the child of a brother-sister marriage. Yuck. (200)One interesting tidbit was that analysis shows that caste has been operating as a factor affecting gene flow in India for at least 1900 years (though, again, it's interesting to me -- and I'm not quite convinced -- because sex and marriage are quite different things. I'd be surprised if male infidelity, in particular, always occurred within social classes -- it's usually downwards. I don't know much about India, but I'm skeptical) (352).Re: race: ""Biology [by which I assume he means phenotype] fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person. In other words, while the physical differences are clearly visible between a white person and a black person, the total amount of difference is much smaller than between two black people. If everyone on Earth was wiped out except for one of the traditional racial groups, say, eastern Asians, we would still preserve 85 percent of the genetic variation that humankind bears"" (235). Although it seems to me that if you were going to choose who the best one remaining example would be, Africans would be the way to go -- way more diversity there than anywhere else, due to sampling bias from the small founding population of humans who left Africa.Finally, can I just say that the lack of citations is frightful. There is some interesting information shared about Roma history and genetics on pp. 209-210, but it's not cited or footnoted, which seems to me a travesty."

It examines the genomes of various peoples and talks about the different adaptations that people developed to survive.It is incredibly fascinating. Going back several generations, everyone from Europe is related to Charlemagne, just like everyone from Asia is related to Genghis Khan. This isn’t just from genetics, it is also supported solidly by statistics. Assuming that everyone has two parents, going back just five generations is already 31 people. Even 600 years back would be equivalent to about 24 generations assuming people had kids at around 25 years of age and 24 generations amount to around 16777215 people. Going back even further allows us to extrapolate our relationships with everyone else. Even the author has 3% of his DNA in common with a Neanderthal, which is the average amount for people of European Descent.The thing to understand is that while DNA can be used as a marvelous tool, it isn’t a perfect record of everyone. Not everyone has been tested and a great amount of ancient DNA has been degraded over time.As I said, the book is really interesting. Adam Rutherford does a really good job of explaining the intricacies of genetics without getting too deep into the subject. It was quite enjoyable, and I do recommend it highly."

But it is indeed a nice collection of stories on an amazing topic. It does read like several articles stitched together in a book. It seems catered towards a British audience (nowt wrong with that) and tilted towards European history (although at a later point the author explains that there are also a scientific reason for that - DNA just doesn’t like warm climates). It did contain enough nuggets of information for me to be a worthwhile read and I think it could be a good introduction for those new to the topic. Verdict: 3.3/5, but Goodreads won’t allow that, so 3 stars."
295,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,0,"The more precise (but far less interesting) title should be “what genetics can and cannot not tell you”. There are many interesting facts in the book. For example, genetics can tell you- Homo sapiens share about 3% genes with Neanderthals. - lactose tolerance started somewhere close to Poland- people have only 20,000 genes; less than bananas or round worms. Also genetics can’t tell you certain things, such as- which nation of native Americans you belong to (there is no tribal purity in genes - how many different races there should be —- the boundaries have to be drawn arbitrarily - which gene dictates what disease — multiple genes together influence your disease likelihood.

296,0297609378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81386854-nehrlisa-behrmann,3,"3.5* A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is an excellent introduction into the science of genetics and human evolution. The author is witty and relatable which made this book a fun read. He dispels a lot of common misconceptions about DNA, race, and human history. I found this book to be worth the read."

But to really understand our origins, as well as everyone else's, we need to move well beyond surface appearances and grasp the essence of what it means to be human, constructed as we are through the action of some 20,000 genes. The first small group of distinct homo-sapiens appeared some 200,000 years ago in east Africa and began their migration into the rest of the world about 100,000 years ago.One area surveyed by the author concerns the fallacy of the concept of race. Genetic data shows clearly that variances within accepted 'racial groups' is more pronounced than the differences between them. In other words the genetic differences between a resident of Beijing and a fellow asian from Hanoi would be greater than between the person from Beijing and someone from London. The point being that the gene set responsible for color pales in comparison to the multitude of other traits and characteristics that constitute an individual. And this is the same for any specific physical or psychological aspect of a particular individual. Of course genetics is only part of the picture and doesn't consider cultural differences. But, from a purely physical perspective, the genetic data hardly supports racial separations.Another revealing insight arising from the data is that virtually every human characteristic is the result of the interaction of a set of genes acting through their agents, the proteins, despite the original hope that traits might be identified with individual genes. This revelation has dramatic implications with regard to health and medicine. There was hope that with the completion of the multibillion dollar effort to map the human genome that matching diseases and disorders with specific genes that rapid advances in medical treatment would be forthcoming. While advances are being made the intricacies and interconnectedness of genes and proteins have resulted in much slower advances than hope for.Today's state of genetic research is also revealing that several species of human existed at the same time - species that could mate and birth viable offspring. Historically, for example, it was thought that Neanderthals and human were so dissimilar that successfully mating was impossible and that homo-sapiens were so antagonistic to Neanderthals that they were totally responsible for Neanderthal extinction. Humans may indeed have hastened the passing of Neanderthals but they also seem to have had some attraction to one another with most Europeans today having received an average of 2.4% of their genes from Neanderthals. The author also concludes that evolution continues today and will in the future. Within a decade or so there will be some 9 billion individuals on planet earth, barring catastrophe. And, within each individual, the same mutability that has been occurring since the first of our kind awakened to awareness continues to create mutations in each individual. Whether favorable mutations would result in species wide adaptation is more problematic due to our vast numbers.My comments have addressed several areas that intrigued me the most. There is much more covered between the covers. It is a worthy read for anyone interested in genetics and inheritance."
