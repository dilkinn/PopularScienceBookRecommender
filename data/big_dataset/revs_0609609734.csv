0,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,5,"I enjoyed this read about the early life of Planet Earth which focuses on geology and geologists. The primary scientist featured, Paul Hoffman, is first shown running his first marathon in a great time. He then has to choose between concentrating on his running and going back to study. The author is showing readers that theories and discoveries are made by real people, with real choices. The facts may be embedded in the rocks under our feet, but unless and until sufficient work is done and science is sufficiently developed, the answers cannot be proven. Stromatalites, very early forms of plant life, took carbon from the air and replaced it with oxygen. These are still found in a bay in Australia. Before them the fossil record shows glaciation. But samples of rock proved, due to the way magnetised particles had lined up at the time the rocks formed, that the ice covered rocks were near the equator, not the poles. Through work by many geologists over many years, these rocks were found all around the world. Namibia, Canada, Australia, Svalbard were all part of land masses which due to continental drift then lay around the equator. And they bore ice. Drop stones are rocks embedded in icebergs that break off glaciers and are dropped to the sea floor as the ice melts. Geologists learn to spot them in the rock record. These, moraines, ice-scraped rocks, oolites, volcanic glass, pillow lava and more are all part of the picture. But geologists pick a spot and return to it year after year, building up a detailed study, jealous of their patch. So we have to follow different people - almost all male, but not all. Science works by one team presenting a hypothesis which is challenged by others who try to prove or disprove it. So we learn what challenges were presented, why this broke up many friendships and created friction, when Paul took up a previous theory that Earth had been solidly covered in ice. Since ice reflects heat, a white Earth should stay frozen. The solution presented was volcanic activity which threw carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air, until the hothouse effect melted the ice. This appeared to have occurred more than once. Then proof of this had to be found in the rock record. This hunt and struggle occupies most of the book, with only a final chapter or two left to see what caused advanced life to form once the ice melted for the last time. I found the book easily readable but I know a lot of the terms and background. If you are interested in geology you will love this book; if you are interested in biology you should also read it as background. A geology student may already be familiar with much of the basic content but still find the concentrated presentation useful. Anyone reading up on continental drift will also be fascinated. What I found many times over to be lacking was photos and maps. Photos of the mountain ranges, stromatalites and fossil tracks of early creatures. Photos, surely, of some of the geology professors. Maps of where the continents used to lie and how they might have girdled the equator. Instead we get a couple of contrasting expeditions the author undertook with professors - one in African bush where she got lost and one on a cold, rainy sea peninsula cliff where she huddled with a group to look for fossils. We have to thank the universities for funding this research by so many people over so many years. I don't want to mark down the rating for the lack of maps and photos, which can probably be hunted for on the net, but if a future edition is being published they would be a big help. "
1,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2306524-quinox,4,"A very good narrative of how a theory is developed over time and the functioning of the scientific community. Easy-read even for those who are not geology buffs. The research for the book takes the author to the ends of the earth and she meets the scientists hunting for proof that the earth at some points in history was completely covered with ice. It can be read as a rea cold case CSI story, with the crime commited billions of years ago. The author also paints a vivid pictures of some of the odd, cool characters that you'll find nowhere but among one of the least known class of scientists - geologists."
2,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"The 'national geographic' tone to this book irritated me from the very beginning and I felt I'd made a mistake in taking it on. The main protagonists are referred to a first name basis and the extended narratives of the authors experience visiting various geological sites and tangential historical anecdotes (e.g. Huxley and Wilberforce) were generally distracting to me, although there was eventually enough substance to make the read worthwhile. At times the tense seems to merge between the past and the present and attempts to describe a stormy winter landscape as 'granite' coloured (as in dappled pink like the orthoclase feldspar?) were not helpful either.The scientific story about snowball earth, both how it happened geologically and how it was discovered, is a fascinating one. Like many new ideas, there have been numerous personal, theoretical and logical challenges to overcome in making them coherent and credible. That ice could have reached the equator and shut down the planet for a few million years is a radical idea, as it 'should' push the earth into a runaway icehouse mode. (Although not stated in this book, this possibility opens the options for the habitability of other planets, provided volcanism can counteract other cold mode settings.) The evidence for the snowball needed to be compiled from numerous sources which are somewhat obvious in hindsight, but subtle beforehand. The elucidation of these gives a useful illustration about how geological science works. For all the discussion of field observations, however, the absence of illustrations (in the kindle version at least) was disappointing, especially since the author seems to have visited many of the key sites. I suspect there is more to the science of this story than was given room in this book, but if this approach is needed to make key geological stories accessible then I welcome it."
3,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"As is often the case, with me at least, the last book I've read leads me to the next one. In this case it was Supercontinent: Ten Billion Years in the Life of Our Planet about plate tectonics that led me to read this book. The former had a section about how it might have been the supercontinent of Rodinia, which is believed to have existed prior to 700 million years ago, that was the partial cause of the so-called Snowball Earth.I was a little put off by the author's flowery, adjective and adverb loaded bio's of the various scientists involved, but overall she does a good job of telling the evolving story of the genesis of the Snowball Earth theory, which posits that the Earth was completely covered with ice not long before complex, multicellular life first appears in the fossil record close to 600 million years ago.I have to admit that there is some morbid fascination to be had from reading how brutally the various scientific factions attack each other as they attempt to promote and prove or denegrate and disprove a major new theory. For a lay person like myself it quickly dispenses any notion that the whole process is very cordial and diplomatic. Nope. Let the mud and spit fly.Like plate tectonics and continental drift theory before it, the Snowball Earth theory is going through an intense period of testing and criticism and is far from being as accepted as plate tectonics is today. So, it's an interesting time to sit on the sidelines and watch the science equivalent of a mixed martial arts tournament take place."
4,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866314-nose-in-a-book-kate,4,"I picked up this book because Walker came highly recommended, not because of the subject matter. In fact, the one aspect of the book I had been interested in (the biology angle) was squeezed largely into one chapter. It turns out that this is a book about geology, which I have very little knowledge of or interest in, yet I found it hugely readable and genuinely enjoyable.The idea is that sometime around 650 million years ago the Earth froze completely over, even at the equator, for a few million years. There’s a lot of geological evidence pointing to this having happened, possibly multiple times in quick (geologically speaking) succession, and it is the theory that best answers a lot of questions raised by odd rock formations and other geological anomalies. However, it’s also a controversial idea that has taken a lot of time and accumulated evidence to reach the state of semi-approval it currently has.It really is to Walker’s credit that she has made a book about looking at rocks so very appealing to me. I think this is partly because she puts the emphasis firmly on the people and personalities involved. This book is as much about Paul Hoffman, a professor of geology at Harvard, as it is about anything else. Walker depicts him as quite the character, difficult and brilliant, with long-standing rivalries and a long string of we-used-to-be-friends, but her picture is still a warm one.- See my full review at: http://www.noseinabook.co.uk/2014/06/..."
5,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10717893-art,4,"Good book about geology, and I'm a geologist so either I'm biased, or I'm a good judge. Maybe both. It discusses a controversial theory (hypothesis, really) that the earth was completely covered with ice for millions of years during the late Proterozoic, right before multicellular life burst upon the Earth. The author has spent time with many of the central investigators, Paul Hoffman in particular, and nicely shows their differing personalities, and how those affect their interactions and the development ideas. Fascinating. It has a bit of the flavor of a travelogue in parts, too, taking us to several places in Australia, to Namibia and the Kalahari, and to both poles.After finishing it, I picked up a recent copy of Science magazine, read an article on the Cambrian Explosion and the Ediacaran fauna, and was surprised to see no mention of global freezing and thawing. Hmm..."
6,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,2,"I had this book on my to-read shelf for years, after I read about another book by the same author. The other book is on my to-read shelf, too, but I am now not sure I want to start it - ever...It's not that I hated the book but I just got bored with about a third way in. I am not a geologist and have no special interest in the details of how a theory was attempted, then disproved, then proved again over time - had hoped the story would be about the phenomenon of ""snowball earth"" rather than the personal life stories of the geologists involved in proving and disproving different theories in connection with snowball earth. Also the tone of the book grated on me - every story seemed to be told with overly dramatic effect - like a bad TV documentary. "
7,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5146555-edward-h-busse-iii,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Boy...are the geologists, biologists, scientists and others who do the reseach on this event dedicated...they are all in on this issue. I never knew that the idea had been proffered that Earth has been completely covered in ice on more than one occasion. The science behind the ice covering is fascinating. Even more so, how life developed/exploded as the last Snowball disappeared. Dr. Walker does an excellent job of weaving the various scientists and their complex relationships together along with each of their scientific disciplines. This book was a real eye opener for me...which is the point of a good book...right? "
8,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998699-jessica,3,"Paul Hoffman is amazing. I'm a grad student in the geology department at the University of Michigan, and PHoff came to give a speech this winter. I had him autograph a stromatolite from Australia. He also signed my friends cap carbonate. He wrote ""The C in this rock came from the CO2 that melted the snowball Earth"". The book itself is great. My field of study has nothing to do with any of this stuff, so I appreciated being able to approach it from a less intense angle than the academic world tends to provide. And quarreling scientists are always entertaining."
9,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,4,"This book explores the hypothesis that the earth nearly froze solid about 700 million years ago, which then triggered the explosion of life on earth. It is told from the perspective of one scientist uncovering clues and trying to make sense of them. In addition to broaching a bold new idea in clear, understandable language, it reads like a detective story. An easy read, considering its intellectual heft."
10,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1387036-bill,4,"This is a rollicking tale of exploration, clashes of big egos, travel and discovery. The book proves you need a very thick skin if you want to be a scientist as the whole point of science seems to be to demolish the current theory and build a new or better one. The good ones stand up to the dynamite, the snowball earth theory appears to be doing just that."
11,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5907923-neal-kerrigan,3,Great look into the creation of a theory. Since I've read it his theory has pretty much been accepted.
12,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21286871-shelagh-plunkett,4,Such a joy to read a really well written and engaging science book. Offers alternative theories to global warming which may or may not hold up but are worth learning either way. 
13,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19753330-hamlen,5,"Gabrielle does a good job detailing the history behind this idea that the earth has moved from through a cycle of temperate climate regions driven by seasons to a frozen singular global winter (snowball state) to a volatile hot house environment and back to the seasonal temperate climate we know today. This theory is playing out in the academic Halls of geology. However, it branches into biology because those geologists determined that the onset and explosion of complex life forms coincided with the last thawing of the snowball. My only concern with this chronicle is that it was published in 2003. I haven't found a sequel bringing the reader up to date with the events over the past 19 years. The proponents of this theory feel there were some 3 - 5 snowball events covering 100's of thousands of years apiece in this timeframe of 590 million years ago. An extension to the theory suggests there was one other snowball some 2 billion years ago. What the author fails to do is demonstrate that this kind of timing in the 4.5 billion year history of the Earth is actually a strong argument for the need and presence of black swans in any description of climate on Earth."
14,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56116681-meera,5,"This is the first book of it's kind that I've read and I have to say I really enjoyed it. While I do have a strong interest in geology and climate change, I thought the author did a great job of telling the story without making it too technical. The stories of the different scientists and their journey to discovering evidence for their theories and hypotheses were well told, suspenseful, and interesting. There was also so much fascinating information throughout the book that I never knew, which made it a fun read. I will say, if you have any remote interest in this topic, geology, ice, climate, etc., then this will probably be a book right up your alley. If you don't particularly have an interest in these areas, then you might find the book a little technical and may want to pass. However, if you've never read a book like this before, this is a great place to start! Also, it's a very inspiring read...what these researchers have managed to discover and contribute to our understanding of our planet is insane (in a good way!) when you think about it. "
15,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64052897-stephan-riediker,5,"It's a really interesting book and it shows how scientific theories can change by investigating new discoveries. We normally take it for granted that we know how the world works but if we have a look beyond the public general education, we can get a clue how scientists struggle to keep or alter a theory by interpreting every slice of evidence. The imagination of a totally different looking and behaving planet indeed makes it very difficult to create reliable models how the climate might have developed. I recommend this book to everyone who is aiming to understand not only our current climate models but also the challenges behind creating those models under completely different conditions. "
16,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60654108-george-cook,4,Slow starter but a really interesting story of the science and scientists behind discovering the huge snow ball ice ages. Shows the hard work behind the scientific method and putting forward new theories 
17,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63302889-tanai-cardona,3,"Quite ok, the science and scientist of this story are a bit overhyped, but it's still a fun read."
18,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765658-steve-walker,2,"Rating of 2.5. An O.K. book about one of the really major topics in geology today. Could have been a stronger book, if the editor and author had used well thought out anddrawn illustrations."
19,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3330869-saskia,4,Great deep dive into the awful personalities of geologists? Made me feel a little better about the awful personalities in my own field; they seem less extreme now.
20,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952516-helen,1,"Well, one paragraph from the description says it all: the Earth was once completely frozen, and starting from this point variety of complex life forms started. Everything else is a story of what lead to this discovery, in tides. I'm not in the age of being interested in such things. If such book was marked as a early teens book, other readers could make informed choice. No luck.If the book was named ""Adventurous Lives of the Eccentrics"", then, at least, reader would have been given a fair warning, and who doesn't need all of this wouldn't pick it up.It seems that we have different opinion about what is ""well written"" or even ""brilliant"". I stumbled over diversions as long as I could, trying eventually find something substantial, related to the book's title, then, after reaching limits of tolerance, closed it and put it down. 1 star from me.One story is interrupted by another, as if someone was unable to follow own thought, drifting away at any distraction. Excessive attention to physical appearances and extravagance. Career achievements, good for him! Where is the topic of the book, the snow ball Earth? What jazz, blues, romantic stories and physical fitness have to with it? Terminology, using ""groupie"" (as hoodie, foodie - not my cup of tea). Dramatic passes sound as tempered child's whims.Intolerable. Couldn't go through all this rubbish. I quit."
21,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"A really engaging book, but the most frustrating part is it didn't explain why the snowball period 590 million years ago (assuming it existed, which the book does a good job of convincing you) would have led to such a proliferation of complex life.Yes, environmental stress leads to new species. But after the thesis given in the first chapter, that this was the catalyst that led single-celled life, which had been quite content for 2.5 billion years, to suddenly go multi-cellular and all specialization cells working together, I think we're owed more.Wouldn't multi-cellular life with specialization have always worked better? In a late chapter, we're also given evidence that a snowball-earth period happened 2 billion years ago, with the really weak ""maybe life wasn't developed enough to get multicellular then."" If it's a eukariotic cell, with a nucleus and RNA and stuff, what other magic level is there between that and a multi-celled organism?Ultimately, it feels like there's a real coincidence of events here that pro-snowballers (that sounds dirty, doesn't it?) figure must have been more than a coincidence.Still, the geology is interesting, and the process through which this hypothesis (that there even was a period during which the whole earth was freezing) slowly gained traction, makes a good read."
22,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39774000-daisy-gould,5,"Although much of the information contained within the book was nothing new to me seeing as a lot of it is taught in A Level Geology classes, I found the way it was written hugely helpful when it came to explaining some of the more complex theories and processes. Despite this, I feel that it would not be a highly recommended book for those looking for something more in depth in terms of the science surrounding Snowball Earth as this seems to keep the level of science very simplified and focuses a lot more on the bibliographical points of Snowball Earth's history, which I, personally, very much enjoyed. One down side of the book, and this is probably a flaw unique to my own preferences, but the author says the work 'intrigued' far too much, which does begin to bug you after a while. Apart from that, I can find little fault with Walker's writing."
23,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7001329-kendra,5,"I liked this book quite a bit and I think Gabrielle Walker is probably a new favorite science writer of mine. I've also read The Ocean of Air which was really wonderful. That one was a much quicker read than this one. I tried to really remember, focus on and understand the geology being discussed here. Maybe not a good book for a half-hearted science reader. I've seen some reviews that were critical of the focus being on both the scientists AND their work (as opposed to JUST on the work), but that's the part I like best."
24,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1221221-weavre,4,"This was a great romp through a fascinating geological controversy. Walker brings to life the scientists, with all their human foibles and brilliance, who conducted the research she presents. Step by step, vehement argument after vehement argument, she follows the development of the now-widely-accepted theory that our planet has, in the past, been a frozen alien world. This work is definitely a storytelling triumph."
25,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493683-angela-boord,4,"While, as usual, I was a bit irked by the tendency of scientific authors to personify ""Earth"" and evolutionary processes (and plate techtonics, in this case) as a sort of substitute for God, this was an excellent story of how science is done -- how theories are made, how the personalities of the scientists involved affect the making of theories -- in addition to the science itself being fascinating. It's also a well-written book by a good story-teller."
26,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925476-donna-jo-atwood,2,"I obviously haven't been keeping up. I've missed this theory that at at least one point earth--ocean and all-- was covered with ice, including the equator.I was reading a long and enjoying it and then I get to checking dates and ages of the people she talking about and I can't make them match up. First Paul is 23 in 1964, and then in 1999 he is 83. Then somebody is his student, and then he's age progressed. Hmm."
27,0609609734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166300-s,2,"Fascinating topic, poor treatment: lots of cliches and bad prose, no pictures - which is fairly unforgivable given the geological detail into which it delves. "
