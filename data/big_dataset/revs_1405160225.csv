0,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,5,"Accessible, readable, amusing, and illuminating. Chris Frith is a highly respected neuroscientist. He uses evidence from brain imaging, from psychology experiments and studies to show how our brains build models of the world, and free us up to concentrate on other things than merely moving about a room or picking up a cup of coffee. He shows how flawed our perception really is, how we manage nevertheless, and how we find certain things terribly difficult. One of these things is grasping large numbers and calculating risks. Somewhere in there he discusses the likelihood of winning the National Lottery, and how it is in fact much more likely that youâ€™ll die in the week before the draw. He points out that if you want to even up your chances, you can wait until shortly before the draw, but how long beforehand are the chances even? The answer: three and a half minutes. "
1,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1791585-harry,4,"Frith explores fundamental questions in cognitive science, particularly the relationship between ""mind"" and ""brain"". This is a wonderful introduction to people interested in the study of the mind. Easy to read, well-written, covers a lot of topics, and doesn't get too bogged down in the details, but directs you to where you can read the details if so inclined. For those in the field of cognitive psychology, this book serves as a good review and is quite a pleasant read. The primary question of concern: how does the machinery of the brain support all the complex functions of the mind? This includes perception and the representations of our world and of other minds. There is an emphasis on the hidden functions of the brain: so much happens that we are not aware of, nor do we need to be aware of them. The efficiency of the brain rests on the predictive nature of cognitive processing and an interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes. Topics touched upon: awareness, illusions, brain damage patients, free will, information theory, visual perception, and brain imaging studies that support these psychological phenomena."
2,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50849-shima,4,It is interesting to know that so much of what we see or hear is determined by what we anticipate or predict! The book is really erudite and readable. 
3,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,4,"A fascinating book about how our brain models the physical world. Frith summarizes our current state of knowledge about how the brain works as discovered by studying the brains of those in which some models don't work; and of those where things work exactly as theory predicts they should. The book is directed at non-specialists, and the author does well in explaining the implications of the data of the MRI scans, or the key concepts from Information Theory and Bayesian statistics. The real limitation of the book is its format - print. Reading through the book, I was led more than once to reflect on just why it is that the printed book will take its place besides clay tablets and papyri in museums within our own lifetimes and why the Kindles and the IPads are going to be ubiquitous fairly soon. It is not just that the economic rationale of how the marginal cost of producing and distributing another copy of a book once it is digitized is almost zero is compelling, or that there is an enormous advantage of having an entire library at ones fingertips. These are factors, surely, as is that fact that printing on paper that comes from having to chop down trees will become increasingly more unviable, but most of all its because these devices can offer a far richer, more interactive experience.To wit, the author has to cite numerous web-sites and online resources throughout the course of the book, and while  a picture  may say a thousand words, sometimes it takes just as many words to explain just what it is that we are seeing. The author does explain the Ames room illusion pretty well, but it would have been way cooler if it could have been  more interactive.Format limitations notwithstanding, it is an interesting, well-written, thought-provoking book."
4,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4644723-eva,5,"Illusions, priming, rubber hands, self-tickling, neurotransmitters, ambiguity, Bayesian observers, hard-wired knowledge, mirror neurons ... Christopher Frith touches upon a vast multitude of facts, experiments and theories about how our brain interacts with the world, and he does it in a highly engaging fashion. A lot of the content i've read about before elsewhere, but somehow Frith manages to tie elements together smoothly and makes you see new connections. I liked the style of including more detailed graphics and notes on experiments alongside the main writing, that you could choose to explore or ignore based on interest. Perception is a fantasy that coincides with reality - our brain creates models of the world and constantly tries to adapt those models based on sensory experience. "
5,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652517-merilee,5,"This is a very witty, erudite, and readable book on how the brain makes up our ""minds."" Frith, brother of the wonderful guitarist, Fred Frith, posits that often when we dream our brains act as IF they are damaged, or in the same ways as the brains of brain-damaged people behave when those people are awake. So much of what we ""see"" or ""hear"" is determined by what we anticipate or predict: our brains fill in large gaps in the blind spots of our senses.http://www.biomotionlab.ca/projects.phpThis is a very interesting site."
6,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4695726-veronica-sicoe,5,What I love most about this book is the clarity and conciseness with which Chris Frith explains how the brain creates our [perception of] reality. He does so mostly in layman's terms yet without being too simplistic or shallow. Fascinating facts combined with a witty and fresh attitude make this book one of the most enjoyable neuropsychology books I've ever read. 
7,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,2,"This book recapitulates some of the standard findings of neuroscience, most of which I have read in other, more in-depth sources. It appears to conclude that free will, albeit important for human life, is an illusion. I don't think Frith's argument to that effect is convincing. Rather, he seems to go along with the crowd of recent commentators on this subject without critically examining their logic and evidence. To the extent he constructs his own argument on free will, it is, in my view, wanting. Of course, Frith is a psychologist and not a neuroscientist. Accordingly, perhaps one should not expect to see from him the intellectual rigor of such neuroscientists as W. R. Klemm and Peter Ulric Tse, both of whom attempt to establish a scientific basis for free will. See also the writings of astrophysicist and philosopher Bob Doyle."
8,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36852749-stone,4,"This is a highly readable account of how our brain works and how it differs from common misconceptions like ""mind"" and ""self"". It debunked a lot of widespread myths concerning neuroscience and psychology in general, while entertaining the readers with various cognitive experiments. I in particular appreciate the way the book was structured -- instead of following the conventional chapter-and-section style, this book was divided into tiny segments of short topics no longer than 5 pages each. It not only helped maintain my interest throughout the entire length of the book but also effectively separated specialized topics from each other. Overall it was a fascinating introduction to neuroscience with respect to both cutting-edge technologies as well as age-long myths and legends. "
9,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88609119-sam,4,"It is this kind of the book, which makes you think a lot during and after the reading. I really liked the way Chris Frith explains how the brain works. Especially taking into account the fact, that I'm absolutely was not familiar with the theme of the book. He is capable to make difficult things clear, and at the same time he does not use childish explanations. I'm often thinking about where is my true conscious is located. Am I in the brain, or in some subunit of it? This book sheds the light on many of these questions.The only strange thing is the editing of the book - the figures where strangely disposed through the text, with the references which were some pages away, or obsolutely without them."
10,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92721414-will-dorrell,5,"A little tour through your perceptions and their relation to the world around (and within?) them.I don't think I've read another book that convinced me of so many things in so few words. Genuinely, this fundamentally changed quite a few ways I understand the world. Shows very clear thinking about, among other things: your mind, the role it plays, the role of your brain in your perceptions and actions.I have quite a lot higher opinion of psychologists now too!AND, not only did he manage this, but, if I'm understanding correctly, he manages to fit a romance into the narrative of this highly non-fiction and referenced book?! This is just one aspect of his very approachable writing style that made the presentation of ideas excellent."
11,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75005592-dmitry,4,"I didn't find very much new in this book, most of the theories, experiments and facts mentioned here are well-known and widely discussed in many other sources. The centerpiece theory about the brain's ""guess, check and correct"" strategy definitely needs more references to experimental data, some of the conclusions seem hasty. So does the final part about the connection between the illusion of free will and altruism - why would you claim something like that 3 pages before the end of the book? We were just getting interested.Still I really enjoyed this one, it's dynamic and witty, readable, clear and informative. A great overview in a charming style. "
12,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7353554-evygirl01,4,"This book was a good overview of the subject, and was accessible enough for most audiences to read."
13,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32761408-vladimir-atamanov,2,Many interesting facts but most of them are well-known. The book is poorly structured. Overall impression: Worse than I expected.
14,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34793254-john-stephens,4,"V. insightful, paving the way for greater understanding of your own brain and the way you are. Lots of very niche humour though."
15,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9472436-natalia,2,This was just 'meh' . I'm by no means an expert on neuroscience but this book didn't provide me with a lot of new information.
16,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51716551-chloe-louise-burns,4,Good for a course recommendation
17,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25063522-jenn,4,This book was very approachable and often funny.
18,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"""Making Up the Mind"" is an adequate introduction to psychology from scientific approach. Chris Frith has discussed main parts of the brain's behavior and mechanism. I recommend to read it."
19,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,4,"This is a no-muss, no-fuss portrayal of how our brains work by a pioneering British neuroscientist.Frith keeps the book moving with succinct descriptions and lots of anecdotes about interesting scientific studies. One of my favorites: one study shows that when we use a digital clock attached to our fingers to estimate the gap between when we decide to tap our finger and then hear a subsequent tone, we think the time gap is shorter than it is because we ""bind together"" our intentions and our actions. This fits in with Frith's basic thesis that our brains are largely prediction machines, constantly testing the results of our predictions and making course corrections (unless we are afflicted with mental illness or brain damage or some other disruptive influence). Much of that predictive work is unconscious, he notes, whether it is how we move our bodies in the world or read emotions and intentions in another person's face or gestures. But our brain's goal, always, is to make better and better models of the world, at least up to the point where the world functions adequately for us. At the end of the book, Frith says he has studiously avoided the challenge many neuroscientists of his age have attempted, which is to describe what the neural correlates of consciousness are -- what makes us aware that we are individuals separate from our senses. Instead, he posits the interesting theory that only when we have a sense of ourselves as autonomous individuals can we actually be altruistic toward others -- that both being selfish and being generous are contingent on a sense that we have free choice. And this, he implies, is what has allowed us to develop such complex, cooperative cultures."
20,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2920307-david,4,"Interesting book on how the brain takes sensory input and interprets it into a meaningful conception of the surrounding world. It's relatively easy to appreciate that when your brain receives sensory data of something you've never encountered before it's necessary to deduce what sort of thing it is - what similarities and differences there are compared to familiar things, and what that implies about this new thing. In reality, that's more-or-less how it works with the familiar objects as well, it just doesn't take as much work for the brain to conclude it's [very probably] a particular familiar thing.The book is short. And while it does refer to scientific experiments which have helped clarify aspects of brain function, it's not dry or stilted or full of jargon. The discussion is interspersed with discussion he [imagined? actually had?] with other college professors at a party who didin't understand his field. This also helped the reading appeal."
21,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6064528-kostas,5,"Chris Frith is a neuropsychologist with direct research experience in the subject matter he writes about, and this shows. Instead of endlessly speculating about what consciousness is, an approach favoured by so many others in the field, he gives a very clear and convincing account of how our brain tricks and deceives us, and how this trickery helps us to survive in and interpret a complex world. He also highlights the social nature of our minds and the practical impossibility of discussing minds in isolation from the social and physical world that surrounds them. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn more about how the mind works without resorting to simplistic explanations and speculative pseudo science. "
22,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5980144-psipsipsi,4,"This is a clearly written book designed for the non-neuropsychologist that describes simple experiments which change the way that we think about who we are and how our brain works. He casts light on the topic of agency, or who is the I of me. The model he reveals is one in which we are embedded in our world, very much a social animal. I particularly appreciated the way that he clearly explained why dopamine is not released to an addictive substance when that substance is expected."
23,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12562790-rick-sanders,4,"This is a very readable presentation of some of the more interesting work in cognitive neuroscience, by a very accomplished researcher. Like most attempts to present science in an entertaining format, it's a little too cute at times. Like most attempts to reach a wide audience, some basic concepts are over-explained while some could be more fully explained. But this is one of the best of its ilk. "
24,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2141032-kevin,4,"An interesting and detailed examination of those parts of the brain that exist outside of consciousness and serve to create the mental world that each of our perceives. An useful antidote to the notion that we are in control of our perceptions and cognitions, with many intriguing examples drawn from both the clinical and the experimental worlds. "
25,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7380284-vince,5,"Frith shows how the brain hides the complex task of aggregating and interpreting sensory data, presenting our minds with a functional (more or less seamless) model of reality. Making up the Mind offers an engaging yet serious presentation of a lifetime's work in behavioral and neuropsychological experimentation."
26,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27124608,3,"Has long planned read this book. after two chapters are nearly disappointed in this book because for himself did not discover anything new. In the continuation the book are told really very interesting moments of brain work, and in a fairly entertaining way. I advise you to read it, especially those who are not familiar with this subject area!"
27,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17615150-alexander-isayenko,0,"The book is more to philosophical and some kind of psychological essay. It has dozens of peculiar stories and interesting examples of different kind of mental diseases. However not so much information about the brain itself, nor abour neurobiological aspect of consciousness. I would say this book is like a light conversation, some kind of small talk about neuroscience."
28,1405160225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44337501-lwdc,4,"A complex book with a basic premise of trying to prove that we are on the inside looking out as the picture on the front depicts, really without a back ground in neurology, psychology or health you will probably stay in the dark with regard to this book. Questioning reality without long philosophical debate is what this book is; keeping it science and making you think..."
