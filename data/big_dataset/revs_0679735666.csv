0,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"A lot of thingys on senses. A lot of diverse material. Some of it rather extreme or nasty. And I was honestly going to rate this 3 stars but then I went to the paragraphs on sky and universe and they conquered me. A very good book to peruse at one's leisure to promote one's understanding of how our senses guide us, have been guiding us all along through this wonderful world.Q: Автор книги о косметике «Секреты мэтра Алексиса из Пьемонта» (Les secrets de Maistre Alexis le Piémontais) уверял, что его туалетная вода сделает женщин привлекательными не то что на вечер, но прекрасными «навсегда». Весьма серьезная заявка; однако потенциальным потребительницам стоило бы прочесть и мелкий шрифт. Вот чудовищный рецепт из этой книги: «Возьми из гнезда птенца ворона и сорок дней откармливай его крутыми яйцами, после чего умертви и дистиллируй вместе с листьями мирта, тальком и миндальным маслом». Изумительно! Дама, несомненно, превратится в прекрасную ворону и навеки оседлает стреху, ну а на такие мелочи, как зловоние и непреодолимое желание процитировать Эдгара По, можно не обращать внимания. (c)Q:Однако странно то, что изготовители этих духов не указывают, чьи феромоны в них содержатся. Человеческих феромонов исследователи пока не обнаружили, а вот, скажем, свиные – нашли. Картина целого поколения молодых женщин, которые гуляют по улицам, умастившись свиными феромонами, представляется странной даже для Манхэттена. Предлагаю хулиганский рецепт: выпустите на Парк-авеню стадо свиноматок. Позвольте им смешаться с толпой женщин, использующих одеколон Pheromone. И вызывайте службу спасения. (c)Q:Один из коллег Гилберта, Джордж Прити, поставил эксперимент, в котором десять участниц через регулярные промежутки времени вдыхали запах пота других женщин. Через три месяца сроки менструаций у испытуемых стали совпадать со сроками у тех, чей пот использовался в эксперименте. В контрольной группе, где нюхали не пот, а алкоголь, менструальный цикл не изменился. Очевидно, что феромоны, которые переносит пот, способствуют синхронизации циклов. Поэтому у соседок по спальням или близких подруг кровотечения часто совпадают; этот феномен известен как эффект Макклинток (по имени заметившей его физиолога Марты Макклинток). Похоже, что существуют и другие эффекты. Если мужчина какое-то время связан с женщиной, волосы на его лице начинают расти быстрее, чем до того. Девочки, живущие в изоляции от мужчин (например, в закрытых школах-интернатах), достигают половой зрелости позже, чем их ровесницы, постоянно общающиеся с представителями другого пола. Матери и новорожденные младенцы распознают друг друга по запаху, поэтому некоторые врачи дают детям вдыхать материнский запах при введении наркоза перед операцией. Младенцы могут узнавать вошедшую в комнату мать по запаху, даже не видя ее. В сказке «Питер Пэн» Дж. М. Барри дети способны даже «чуять опасность» во сне. Матери школьников могут по запаху различать футболки, которые носят их дети. Отцам такие способности не присущи, но мужчины могут определять пол того, кто носил футболку. Феромоны действуют на людей. Но насколько сильно? (с)Q:Запахи пробуждают не только воспоминания, но также и наши дремлющие чувства; они балуют и радуют нас, помогают определиться с нашими представлениями о самих себе, будоражат чувственность, предупреждают об опасности, вводят в искушение, раздувают религиозный пыл, возносят до небес, приобщают к моде, погружают в роскошь. (c)Q:Для одного из экспериментов наняли множество домохозяек, чтобы те нюхали подмышки незнакомых им людей; в другом эксперименте, который финансировали изготовители женского гигиенического спрея, картина была еще необычнее. (c)Q:Природа развивается благодаря метисам. Девиз жизни: «Смешивайтесь тщательнее». (c)Q:Мы, кажется, неспособны жить в природе без того, чтобы заимствовать ее запахи и носить их с собой как талисманы, «присваивая» себе свирепость, магнетизм или энергию, которые свойственны их естественным обладателям. (c)Q: Людям, собирающимся на вечеринку в ночь с дождем и бурей, не требуется обильно пользоваться духами, потому что перед бурей они пахнут сильнее – влажность обостряет обоняние, и при низком давлении летучесть жидкостей повышается. Все-таки духи на 98 % состоят из воды и спирта – и лишь 2 % составляют жировые и ароматические молекулы. При низком давлении молекулы испаряются быстрее и могут покидать человеческое тело и переходить в воздух помещения со значительной скоростью. То же самое происходит, даже в солнечные дни, в городах, расположенных в горах, – например, в Мехико, Денвере или Женеве, где из-за высоты атмосферное давление всегда низкое. Идеальным местом и временем для того, чтобы ошеломить окружающих новыми духами, был бы ресторан El Tovar Lodge, примостившийся на головокружительной высоте более чем 2100 метров на краю Большого каньона, в преддверии бури.(c)Q: Для охотника за трюфелями прогулка по невидимой плантации может быть очень забавной, а для его свиньи – весьма печальной. Представьте: вот привлекательная здоровая свинья чует такого сексуального хряка, какого еще в жизни не встречала, только он почему-то сидит под землей. Возбужденная свинья принимается старательно рыть, но находит лишь странный пухлый гриб неправильной формы. Потом она обнаруживает еще одного хряка-супермачо где-то совсем близко от нее – опять под землей – и с еще большим неистовством зарывается в яму. Вероятно, она впадает в ярость от неудовлетворенного желания. В конце концов добытчик трюфелей укладывает грибы в мешок и тащит свинью домой, невзирая на то что вся роща позади дрожит от густых запахов заходящихся от вожделения кабанов, каждый из которых призывает ее к себе, но при этом упорно прячется. (c)Q:Небо – это единственная визуальная константа в нашей жизни, сложный фон для всех наших предприятий, мыслей и эмоций. И все же мы склонны воспринимать его как невидимое – как пустоту, а не вещество. Всю жизнь преодолевая прозрачные глубины воздуха, мы тем не менее редко изображаем его густым и тяжелым. Мы редко задумываемся о голубой иллюзии, именуемой небом. По-английски небо – «sky». «Skeu, – говорю я вслух то же слово, которым пользовались наши дальние предки; я стараюсь произносить его с тем же страхом и восхищением, какие могли звучать в их речи: – Skeu». Вообще-то так они называли покрытия любого рода. Небо для них было крышей, меняющей цвета. Неудивительно, что они поселили там своих богов, а те, как часто бывает у склочных соседей, в припадках гнева кидались – правда, молниями, а не посудой.Q:Посмотрите на собственные ноги. Вы стоите в небе. Говоря о небе, мы обычно задираем головы, но начинается-то оно на земле. Мы ходим сквозь него, кричим в него, собираем в нем опавшую листву, купаем собак и ездим на автомобилях. Оно попадает в нас с дыханием. С каждым вдохом мы вбираем в себя миллионы молекул неба, быстро нагреваем их и выдыхаем обратно в мир. В эти мгновения через нас проходят те же самые молекулы, которыми некогда дышали Леонардо да Винчи, Уильям Шекспир, Энн Брэдстрит или Колетт. Глубоко вдохните. Вспомните «Бурю». Мехи легких приводят воздух в движение, и он питает энергией наши клетки. Мы говорим «легкий как воздух», но ведь атмосфера отнюдь не легка – она весит пять тысяч триллионов тонн. Удержать ее на земле может лишь столь упрямая сила, как притяжение, – не будь ее, воздух улетел бы и рассеялся в бескрайних просторах космоса. (c)Q:Мы часто бездумно говорим о «пустом небе». Но небо никогда не пустует. В одной унции воздуха содержится тысяча миллиардов триллионов вращающихся атомов кислорода, азота и водорода, каждый из которых – это скопище электронов, кварков и призрачных нейтрино. Порой мы восхищаемся «спокойным» днем или «тихой» ночью. Но покоя нет ни в небе, ни где-либо еще, где жизнь встречается с материей. Воздух всегда трепещет в возбуждении, он полон летучих газов, выброшенных спор, пыли, вирусов, грибов и животных, которых треплют, завывая, неутомимые ветры. Существуют активные летуны – бабочки, птицы, летучие мыши и насекомые, – освоившие воздушные дороги, а есть летуны пассивные – осенние листья, пыльца, семена молочая, – которые просто дрейфуют. Небо, начинающееся на земле и распространяющееся во всех направлениях, – это объемное, зыбкое царство, в котором мы обитаем. Говоря, что наши отдаленные предки выползли на землю, мы забываем добавить, что в действительности они переместились из одного океана в другой, из верхних слоев воды – в нижние, придонные слои воздуха. (c)Q:Здесь, на побережье, господствуют ветры с запада; это хорошо видно по причудливым формам прибрежной растительности. Легкий устойчивый бриз с Тихого океана взметает степные травы в прическу «помпадур». Чуть дальше, в не таком открытом месте, я наткнулась на небольшой участок, ограниченный кру́гом голой земли. Выглядит так, будто кто-то воткнул в землю формочку для печенья, но это сделал ветер.(с)Q:Мы считаем ветер деструктивной силой – внезапным шквалом, срывающим крышу с оклахомской школы, – но ветер еще и терпеливый и умелый каменотес, который вырезает скалы, протачивает горные склоны, формирует пляжи, сбрасывает деревья и камни с гор или в русла рек. Ветер создает волны, хоть в чувственно выгнутых барханах Долины смерти, хоть вдоль непрерывно меняющихся побережий. (с)Q:На старинных картах северный ветер изображали в виде головы толстощекого взъерошенного человека с напряженным выражением лица, который, выпятив губы, дует изо всех сил. Согласно Гомеру, бог Эол жил в огромной пещере и держал ветры в кожаном мешке. Этот мешок он дал Одиссею, чтобы нужный ветер привел его корабль к дому, но спутники Одиссея открыли мешок, ветры вырвались на свободу, передрались и разбежались по миру, сея хаос. «Детьми утра» назвал ветры грек Гесиод. У древних китайцев слово «фун» означало и ветер, и дыхание, а для обозначения характера ветра у них было много слов. «Тиу» означало «качаться на ветру, как дерево». «Яо» – что-то плывущее с ветром, как пушинка. Имена ветров наделялись магической силой; они очень много говорят о настроениях, которые бывают у неба. Это и португальский венто де коадо, стоковый ветер с гор; и японский демонический вихрь цумидзи, и нежный мацукадзе – ветерок в соснах; это австралийский парадоксальный брикфилдер (так поначалу называли горячие ветра, которые несли пыль с кирпичных заводов, расположенных южнее Сиднея); и американский теплый и влажный чинук, приходящий с моря и названный в честь индейского племени, населявшего некогда Орегон; или снежная пурга, или обжигающий санта-ана, или сырой ваймеа на Гавайях; это и североафриканская горячая песчаная буря самум (от арамейского «самма» – яд); или сонда, срывающаяся с Анд в Аргентине и иссушающая пампу; черный страшный хабуб в долине Нила, летние бури или зимние бураны в России и освежающий летний этезиан в Греции; и швейцарский теплый порывистый фён, спускающийся с подветренных склонов гор; и французский сухой холодный мистраль («господствующий ветер»), проносящийся шквалом по долине Роны на Средиземноморское побережье; это знаменитый индийский муссон, само название которого означает климатический сезон; и белый шквал или «бычий глаз» у мыса Доброй Надежды; дерзкий вилливо на Аляске; или дату, вырывающийся на восток через Гибралтарский пролив; это певучий испанский солано, карибский харрикейн (от «хуракан» – «злой дух» на языке таина), шведский яростный фриск винд, ласковый тянь тянь фын – первый осенний ветерок в Китае и многие, многие другие. (с)Q:Вообще-то сначала с неба идет короткий пробный разряд; в ответ земля посылает вверх продолжительную вспышку, которая мгновенно нагревает воздух, и он взрывается воздушной волной – громом. Отсчитав секунды между вспышкой и громом, я делю их число на пять и узнаю приблизительное расстояние до вспышки. Сейчас это 11 с лишним километров. Звук проходит в секунду 331 метр. Если звук приходит одновременно с молнией, шансов прикинуть расстояние очень мало. (c)Q:Лоренс ван дер Пост смотрел в окно поезда на бескрайние степи и бесконечное небо Сибири. «Я думал, что никогда прежде не попадал в место, где было бы столько простора и столько неба», – писал он в «Путешествии в глубь России». Особенно его поразили «огромные грозовые тучи, движущиеся из темноты в сторону спящего города и похожие, благодаря судорожно мечущимся молниям, на сказочных лебедей, мчащихся к нам, размахивая шуршащими огненными крыльями». Русский друг, сопровождавший ван дер Поста в поездке, сообщил ему, что для таких молний в русском языке есть специальное название: «зарница». (c)Q:На планете Земля наступила ночь. Но это всего лишь причуда природы, следствие того, что наша планета вращается в пространстве со скоростью 1674 км/ч (на экваторе). В тот период, который принято называть «ночью», мы вглядываемся в потаенные глубины космоса, где существуют другие солнечные системы и где, возможно, тоже есть свои жители. Не воспринимайте ночь как отсутствие дня, считайте его некой разновидностью свободы. Отвернувшись от своего Солнца, мы видим сияние дальних галактик. Солнечный свет не слепит, мешая разглядеть звездный плащ Галактики, в которой мы обитаем. Черноту, которая, кажется, простирается между звезд без конца и края и даже уходит во времени вспять к Большому взрыву, мы зовем бесконечностью. Ночь – это мир теней. Все тени, которые можно увидеть ночью, создаются лунным светом или искусственным освещением, но ночь сама по себе – тень. (c)Q: За городом можно увидеть больше звезд, и ночь там похожа на перевернутый колодец, который становится все глубже и глубже. Если набраться терпения и дать глазам привыкнуть к темноте, можно разглядеть Млечный Путь, проходящий через все небо белесой полосой. Различные культуры объединяют звезды в разные созвездия; и с Млечным Путем у них связаны собственные легенды. Бушмены Калахари зовут его «хребтом ночи». У шведов это «зимняя дорога», ведущая в небесный край. У островитян с Гебрид – «тропа тайного народа». У норвежцев – «путь призраков». У патагонцев, почитающих своих нелетающих птиц, – «белая пампа, где призраки охотятся на нанду». Зато в городе куда легче отыскать самые известные созвездия – ведь там видно гораздо меньше звезд. (c)Q:Сколько же путешественников, заплутавших на суше или в море, с нетерпением ожидали ночи, рассчитывая отыскать с помощью Полярной звезды дорогу домой. И мы ищем ее на небе, уподобляясь нашим далеким предкам-кочевникам. Сначала нужно найти ковш Большой Медведицы и провести прямую через две крайних звезды. Тогда Полярная звезда покажется каплей сливок, упавшей с края перевернутого ковша. Если Большую Медведицу не видно, север поможет найти Кассиопея – созвездие, расположенное чуть ниже Полярной и похожее на W или М, в зависимости от времени года. Мне оно всегда казалось похожим на бабочку. Благодаря вращению Земли звезды проплывают по небу с востока на запад, поэтому стороны света можно определить и таким способом: неотрывно смотреть на какую-нибудь яркую звезду. Если будет казаться, что она поднимается, значит, вы смотрите на восток, а если снижается – то на запад. Когда я была скаутом, мы находили стороны света, втыкая в землю прямую палочку. Потом на несколько часов расходились заниматься своими делами и возвращались, когда тень от палочки достигала 15 сантиметров в длину. Поскольку солнце движется на запад, тень указывает на восток. Случалось использовать вместо компаса наручные часы – поверните их циферблатом вверх и направьте часовую стрелку на солнце. Держите сосновую иголку или травинку вертикально у края циферблата, чтобы тень лежала вдоль часовой стрелки. Юг окажется посередине между часовой стрелкой и двенадцатью часами. Существует много других способов определять стороны света, ведь скитания – одно из любимых занятий людей (но лишь в том случае, если они уверены, что смогут благополучно вернуться домой). Если у дерева, стоящего на открытом месте, одна сторона обильно заросла мхом, то, скорее всего, там север – мох предпочитает затененную сторону дерева. У пня годовые кольца с южной стороны будут шире. Имеет смысл также взглянуть на вершины сосен – они по большей части указывают на восток. Или, если вдруг вы знаете направление господствующих ветров, можно ориентироваться по согнутой ветром траве. (c)Q:Сейчас я не могу увидеть свет других планет, но знаю, что все они находятся на своих местах, равно как и астероиды, кометы, дальние галактики, нейтронные звезды, черные дыры и другие чудеса глубокого космоса. И представляю их себе с той же уверенностью, с какой Уолт Уитмен заявлял: «Яркие солнца, которые вижу, и темные солнца, которых не вижу, – на своем месте» (с)Q:Каждый день, независимо от времени года и погоды, я совершаю пятнадцатиминутные прогулки быстрым шагом, и все же оказалось, что чувствую себя и энергичнее и, в общем, счастливее, если зимняя прогулка приходится на раннее или хотя бы не очень позднее утро; так я и поступаю каждый день без исключения. (с)Q:Шишковидное тело (или «третий глаз», как с мистическим почтением именуют эту железу), по-видимому, непосредственно связано с нашим ощущением времен года, благополучия, наступления половой зрелости, количества производимого тестостерона или эстрогена и некоторых более тонких реакций организма на смену сезонов в природе. У мужчин наивысшая концентрация тестостерона наблюдается в начале второй половины дня (около 14 часов) в октябре; предполагаю, что дело здесь в том, что ребенок, зачатый в это время, родится летом, и у него будут наивысшие шансы на выживание. Конечно, далеко не все мужчины ждут для занятий любовью этого апогея осенней погоды, ведь либидо постепенно нарастает и в сентябре, а некоторое снижение происходит лишь к Рождеству.(с)Q:В японском лишь недавно появилось слово для синего. В былые времена слово «aoi» служило обобщающим понятием для целого ряда цветов – и зеленого, и синего, и фиолетового. В примитивных языках сначала появляются обозначения для черного и белого, затем добавляется красный, потом желтый и зеленый; во многих языках синий и зеленый объединяются, а некоторые народности не видят смысла различать остальные цвета спектра. У греков было очень мало слов для обозначения цветов, и ученые ведут ожесточенные споры о том, что именно Гомер имел в виду, говоря о «винноцветном море». Уэльсцы словом «glas» описывают цвет горного озера, которое может быть и голубым, и серым, и зеленым. На суахили «nyakundu» – и коричневое, и желтое, и красное. Племя яли с Новой Гвинеи не имеет прилагательного «зеленый», и листья у них бывают темными или светлыми. Английский язык может похвастаться множеством слов для синего и зеленого (в частности: лазурный, морской волны, бирюзовый, темно-синий, изумрудный, индиго, оливковый), мы часто спорим, синим или зеленым следует считать предмет, и, как правило, прибегаем к сравнениям: зеленый как трава или как горошек. Колористический запас английского языка заметно хромает, когда дело доходит до процессов, связанных с жизнью. Полагаю, нам стоит последовать примеру новозеландских маори, имеющих множество прилагательных для красного – всех оттенков красного, ярких и бледных, какими бывают цветы и фрукты, текущая и запекшаяся кровь. Нам требуется описать все разнообразие зеленых, от почти тыквенно-желтой с зеленоватым отливом поздней зимней травы до немыслимой яркости листвы в разгар лета, и все варианты распределения хлорофилла между этими крайностями. Нам нужны слова для множества цветов облаков, от жемчужно-розоватого во время заката над океаном во время штиля до электрического серо-зеленого цвета торнадо. Нужно обновить набор слов для коричневого, чтобы охватить все изыски древесной коры. И еще нам остро требуются обобщающие слова для изысканных цветов, которые меняются при ярком солнечном освещении, или бледнеют в искусственном, или насыщены чистым пигментом, или нежно купаются в лунном свете. (с)Q: Цвет существует не в мире, а в мозгу. (с)"
1,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145023-kay,5,"Over a decade ago I picked up a book that changed my life. It was Diane Ackerman's ""A Natural History of the Senses"", and her humanist, holistic, sensitive approach to that most basic of subjects; how we sense the world, was a revelation. Her writing was inclusive and funny, at once deep and yet accessible. She loved to explore complex issues like the olfactory system, or the sounding of whales, and to take the reader along on that exploration. Science was no longer dry and I was no longer excluded from it. I read it like a novel.Since then I've lost two copies to 'borrowers' and given away five. Whenever I feel that I have nothing to say, I take this book from the shelf, read a few paragraphs about something, anything, and am immediately reminded that my ability to experience is a series of miracles. It may not inspire me immediately, but within a few hours I'll have seen or smelt, touched or heard or tasted something that I want to write about - and Ackerman will have worked her magic on me again."
2,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132698-erin,1,"This book was really hard to get through. The only reason I even finished it is that she did include a few really interesting facts about the senses. But her writing style is torturous!!!!! She writes in this really flowery style with way too many metaphors and adjectives that don't even make sense! Here's one: ""Craving the dialect of cities, I forgot the way deer steal into the yard with their big hearts and fragile dreams"". What??? There's no context for this and it doesn't make any sense. This happens once a paragraph, at least. Next, she goes on and on about how intensely she senses things. She basically says that she had an orgasm once when she saw a pretty landscape, and then she cried once while looking at a big piece of sulphur because the yellow color was so intense. She's either just lying or totally weird. And to end it all, she talks about how some great writers sensed things more intensely or differently that most people. And she has the audacity to include herself in the group of great writers! I hate her so much. Do not read this book."
3,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"Touch me, taste me. Hear me, smell me, see me. Our senses form our most intimate connections. Even using them in writing evokes a sense of nearness, of vulnerability. In her book A Natural History of the Senses, Diane Ackerman explores each of our senses with rich, resplendent prose. Reading this increased my awareness of the physical sensations within and around me in a thorough and authentic way, so I would recommend it to any aspiring writer or anyone interested in mindfulness.Not only does Ackerman each sense in a real and vibrant way, she also delves into the science and history behind each one. Ranging from the complexities of the nervous system underlying our skin cells to how the olfactory nerves that contribute to smell also affect taste, Ackerman proves the extensive nature of her research while still writing in clear, readable prose. She also explores how each sense affected cultures and societies in years past. The diversity of this book and how Ackerman discussed senses in a variety of axes deepened her already impressive, thoughtful writing.Ackerman has experience with poetry, and you can tell from her lush use of language. While her thorough prose and long paragraphs may come across as off-putting at times, her control as a writer and as a researcher make A Natural History of the Senses well worth the read. Overall, I would suggest giving this one a shot if you want to get more int ouch with your physical world, or if you want a great example of how to articulate our senses - connections many of us have yet take for granted."
4,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/396899-sarah-canavan,2,"The more I read of this book, the more I wanted it to be over. I enjoyed the small tidbits of information and etymology facts dispersed far and too few between her grandiose anecdotes but I really couldn't get over how proud of herself Ackerman seems to be. It was just exhausting hearing about all the wonderful sensory experiences she's had. I get it. I've had my own, even if they weren't while exploring Antarctica or vacationing in the exotic middle-east as a college student. Uhg. She didn't really stick to the senses, it was as if she just kind of chose random things to ramble on and on about and justified their inclusion because we use our senses to perceive them.. duh. And just when she would make an interesting comment that I'd love to hear more about, she'd jump to another off-the-wall topic. I really don't want to read anything else by her of such great length. Her poetry does it for me but this prose crap doesn't. There were many excerpts from other authors dealing with the sensory world, like from Nabokov's Speak, Memory that just made me wish I'd chosen that book instead, as they do it much better than her..."

6,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris,5,"A marvellous and unique insight into the sensual world, this is at the same time beautifully-written and immensely evocative. We take our senses so much for granted - and in literature, we often use them in such a limited, unimaginative capacity. This book serves as a reminder that each of our senses has its own very personal narrative; that memories and emotions are linked to specific physical triggers; and that by exploring these, we can become so much more aware of ourselves and of our surroundings, and experience more fully the amazing spectrum of what our senses offer us. "
7,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/205220-nicole,5,"I was given this book as a high school graduation present from two retired high school teachers and it proved to be one of my all time favorites. It should be required reading for any human being. You will learn fascinating things like that we can identify only 10,000 different tastes and anything else you've ever wanted to know about your senses. It's fascinating and mind blowing."
8,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1987935-erica-bauermeister,5,"This book was my favorite research source when I was writing The School of Essential Ingredients. Diane Ackerman manages to make science poetic, and her metaphors can be astonishing. Such lush, playful descriptions -- whenever I needed to get back in the writing mood, I would read bits of it and feel my senses waking up."

Did you know tattooed people live shorter lives because their skin can't breathe properly? That in business meetings, studies found that the person of higher status most often initiates a touch? This exploration of the five senses is a fascinating read.But, unfortunately, it's quite choppy and too often reads like a laundry list of trivia with no proper transitions or general point. What's worse is that it may not be entirely accurate, either. The author was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, but here she can't accurately quote a popular film. She quotes the protagonist in Lawrence of Arabia as saying, ""The trick is not to mind,"" in that scene where he talks about pain as he puts out a burning match with his fingers. I've seen the movie and he actually says, ""The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.""As a former newspaper reporter, it drives me nuts to see somebody paraphrasing and then using quotation marks around their inventions. Pulitzer, really? ""No, effendi,"" to quote Lawrence. In another chapter, the author talks about the houris in Islamic paradise and how they're made ""entirely of sandalwood."" I've read quite a bit on Islam and never heard this, so I researched and found that the houris are indeed made up of different wonderful scents. But not exclusively of sandalwood. If I can't trust the author based on those two slips, then what else in the book should I take with skepticism? More reviews on my blog. "
11,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1730247-stephen,5,"I guess it helps if you have a crush on the author of the book you are reading. What can I say? It happens. But smitten or not, this was a delight. The first two books I reported on by poet turned naturalist Diane Ackerman chronicled her adventures in pursuit of rare and wonderful wildlife: bats, whales, penguins, etc. In “A Natural History of the Senses” she turned inward, exploring we humans and the way we experience our world.“We tend to see distant past through a reverse telescope that compresses it: a short time as hunter-gathers, a long time as “civilized” people. But civilization is a recent stage of human life, and, for all we know, it may not be any great achievement. It may not even be the final stage. We have been alive on this planet as recognizable humans for about two million years, and for all but the last two to three thousand we’ve been hunter-gathers. We may sing in choirs and park our rages behind a desk, but we patrol the world with many of a hunter-gather’s drives, motives, and skills,” writes Ackerman.“Consciousness, the great poem of matter, seems so unlikely, so impossible, and yet here we are with our loneliness and our giant dreams.”It really hasn’t been that long since we were sleeping in caves in family groups. A sumptuous read about our historic reliance on taste, touch, smell, sight and our sense of hearing to get us through our world unscathed and sated. "
12,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2365252-eva,1,"This book was a disappointment. I expected a decently written, informative book on the history of human senses, and instead got a strange mix of facts, myths and incredibly self-indulgent personal narrative that I couldn't bring myself to care for.I understand the book is 25 years old so some theories will be inevitably outdated, but Ackerman mixes scientific theories with bits of randomly picked interesting trivia that she clearly didn't bother to critically examine and some wide-spread folk beliefs that not even QI panellists would fall for. The writing style tries to be sensual and poetic, but sounded utterly pretentious to me (there is a limit to the number of times you can use 'robust' in 300 pages without sounding ridiculous and Ackerman crosses the point and leaves it far behind her). The whole book felt like a chance for the writer to brag about her fantastic life experiences (yes we get it, you got to tag Monarch butterflies and it was amazing, good for you!) while trying to pass her incredibly narrow, white-rich-American-heterosexual-woman point of view as the universal way of experiencing senses. It would work perfectly well as an autobiography or a personal narrative but not as something that aims to be sold as popular science. "

Such is Ackerman's ""Natural History of the Senses"" for me. Every little natural thing becomes an object of interest with a story to tell. I have often wanted to sit with my feet up, at dusk, in a screened in porch, with Diane Ackerman by my side. She would, I am sure, sit quietly and observe, but when she did say something it would be extremely fascinating. "
15,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863087-kate-conroy,4,"This book was given to me as a graduation present from my high school art teacher–only he didn’t actually get around to giving it to me until probably about a year ago, and I graduated high school in 2012. I read this while in treatment, mostly at 3:15 AM, which was when I had to wake up to get weighed and get my blood pressure and heart rate checked, which was always atrocious, so then I had to sit and drink a Gatorade while the nurses watched to make sure I didn’t pour it into the flower pots like some girls did. So I would read this while waiting to see a nurse, and sometimes they would ask me what I was reading, and I’d show them, and they’d read the back cover with looks of total confusion on their faces.The book is divided up into sections based on the five senses, and each section rambles on about that sense. It’s strange how A Natural History of the Senses is written so poetically, yet it’s full of scientific studies and facts. One of my favorite facts that I wrote down so I wouldn’t forget it is that heart attack patients who have pets live longer than those without. When I was in treatment, I thought about how much I missed my cat more than anyone else. Another cool fact from the section on smell is that people can tell just from smelling an article of clothing whether it was worn by a male or female, and a mother can tell if something was worn by her child based on smell as well. I will have to test that out when I’m a mother.This book gave me a lot of really inspirational quotes to write down as well. My favorites are as follows:A mind that is stretched to a new idea never returns to its original dimension. –Oliver Wendell Holmesand,The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place. –Walt WhitmanThe Walt Whitman quote hit me pretty hard, I think. To me, it means that whether or not I understand it, everything is the way it’s supposed to be. (I dislike the quote “Everything happens for a reason,” because that sounds too cliché, but that’s basically what I mean here.) And maybe this isn’t true for everyone. Probably for most people it isn’t, because it doesn’t need to be. But it was true for Whitman, and I think it’s true for me, because I need it to be true. Otherwise, I don’t know how to accept my life. I have to believe that it has to be this way, it can only be this way, it was always going to be this way, and any other way wouldn’t be right, even if it would hurt less.In any case, I’m giving this four out of five stars because sometimes the flowery language was a little much for me, and it gets a little sensual at times, which made me mildly uncomfortable. Still, I recommend it to all. Thanks, Mr. Marano. Miss you.Read more book reviews @ katelikesbooks.wordpress.com!"
16,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936339-ammie,3,"Here's what Barbara Kingsolver has to say about Diane Ackerman: ""[She:] begins each summer day 'by choosing and arranging flowers for a Zenlike hour or so.' She listens to music obsessively, then speed-walks for an hour, every single day. 'I don't know whether this helps or not,' she allows... 'My muse is male, has the radiant, silvery complexion of the moon, and never speaks to me directly.'""Please read that last line again. A lot of this book sounds like that, although usually it's not quite so blatantly cheesy. But... It's close. This book was frustrating because there's so much interesting writing in it, but I was constantly derailed by Ackerman's sheer presence within her own writing. It's hyperbolic and three-quarters, which is fun in small doses but tiresome in the long run.  On the other hand, there was a lot of interesting information--even if it often seemed only loosely related to the theme--which was sometimes awesome and sometimes not so much. In the vision section, for instance, she discusses the vision problems of various artists and how that may have influenced their work: fascinating. However, she also spends pages writing about looking at the sea, which is a nice bit of writing but (given the onslaught of other distractions scattered throughout the book) sort of overdone. I also felt like a lot of scientific information was presented as simple fact when, from what I've gathered from other readings, it is nowhere near that clearcut. That alone made me approach virtually the entire book with deep distrust and more than a pinch of salt, and the prose couldn't quite stand up to my skepticism.Verdict: pretty writing, some interesting insights, but in the end distractingly ornamented and rather scattered. "
17,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24673004-david-b,5,"It is no surprise that author Diane Ackerman has also written several books of poetry. Her poet's sensibility is certainly put to good use here. She uses beautiful, evocative prose to consummate what is clearly a long-standing love affair with the five senses. Although this book is well-reasoned and researched, including much fascinating information about how the senses operate, this is not really a rigorously scientific book. Rather, it is a collection of essays that often have little apparent connection to each other apart from the particular sense under discussion. One moment we might be reading about the latest (at the time of publication) scientific findings about our sense of smell; on the next page we may encounter profiles of people who work as professional smellers for the perfume industry; from there we might move to Ackerman's own garden or a memory of time spent in a eucalyptus grove. The result is an interesting, highly idiosyncratic journey through our senses and what they mean to us."
18,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/139053-bernadette,2,"It took me a very long time to finish this book. I wanted to like it much more than I actually did. I've loved Ackerman's poetry and I really enjoyed The Zookeeper's Wife, a work of historical fiction by her. But A Natural History of the Senses, as a work of nonfiction, comes across as being completely without structure, except for being divided into sections according to each ""sense."" Each section holds dozens of brief (2-5 page) sub-sections tangentially related to that sense. Some of the tethers stretch very thin on those tangents.The sub-sections I enjoyed most were the ones that featured actual historic and scientific details about that sense, its origins, how it developed differently among the different species. I was very interested in the various scientific institutes that research each sense. That is what I thought, based on the title, that this book would be about. Unfortunately, there is far more random anecdotal reminiscing by Ackerman about the various sensory experiences she's had throughout her life -- the exotic trips to Antarctica, scuba-diving in the Bahamas, a spa in Bermuda, meals in Amazonian Brazil, etc. Ahhh, the rough life of a researcher! Also cloying were the several attempts at listing every aphorism or cliche related to a particular sensory experience.Some of the favorable reviews of this book mention that the readers enjoyed skipping around the sections, reading here and there, opening at random. And that is probably the best way to experience this book. In trying to read it straight through, I believe it was sensory overload. Redundancies became all too obvious, points belabored. In skipping around, readers have a chance to sample here and there, never filling up on one menu item, ensuring the next time they return their appetites will still be there."
19,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2069339-anna-banana,4,"At once history, biology, and anthropology this book explores the 5 senses from a variety of perspectives. Ackerman writes with intense imagery that can be beautiful or brutal. Memorable indeed was a discussion of the cultural evolution of flavor, complete with a medieval recipe for cooking a LIVE goose. I loved her discussion of how smell is the sense most closely linked to memory (which explains why sometimes, washing my hands in public bathrooms, I get instantly transported back to kindergarten through the power of the scent of the soap.) It's a fascinating read."
20,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/703260-tags-taggart,4,"This is a fascinating meander through the five senses. Ackerman's writing is so precise and lively, I picked up some fab new words from her, and was grossed out on the cannibalism specifics in the taste section. There isn't a lot of structure to pull you through this, but all of it is riveting and quirky. I think I see some seeds for ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" in the taste section too."
21,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet,5,"A staple of the writer's reference shelf. As long as the human being exists in the body, the writer needs to consider the senses."
22,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7090747-sara,1,"Perhaps I'm too left-brained for this book, but for me, reading ""A Natural History of the Senses"" is like drowning in quicksand. Ackerman divides the book into six sections: Smell, Touch, Taste, Hearing, Vision and Synesthesia. There are many things I don't like about the book, but I will admit that she is consistent. By that I mean, that she consistently annoys me. From the beginning she is over-the-top poetic in her narrative using flowery language and overusing literary imagery such as metaphors and similes. On the first page of ""Smell"" she writes, ""Smells detonate softly in our memory like poignant land mines, hidden under the weedy mass of many years and experiences."" This is a beautifully written simile in poetic narrative, but the style is overused.She also likes to make lists and ends up creating LENGTHY sentences. On page 15 there is a sentence that is 31 lines long. In this particular example she seems to want us to know how well-read she is by listing every possible literary reference to smell. Ackerman makes these lists throughout the book, all of which are too long.Furthermore, she doesn't write in a consistent tense. I can understand changing tenses from essay to essay, but all too often, she changes tenses within an essay. Typically, she will write in the first-person present tense to pull the reader into a particular moment of an experience. I understand her goal, but suddenly, she will take off in another direction, switching into third person past-tense only to return to first person present in order to continue describing her experience. This is awkward, confusing and distracting. Other problems include the lack of scientific basis for her assumptions and the inclusion of too many irrelevent (albeit interesting) anthropological anecdotes. I can not possibly read past the ""Hearing"" section. It's rare that I don't finish a book, but I just can't take it anymore. "
23,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183993-nathan,3,"Oops: I just left it in the airplane with a few pages left. Oh well. My indifference to my loss says something. Ackerman's systematic attack of the senses is interesting and fact-filled, but ultimately not cohesive or exciting enough to keep me engaged.She does a wonderful job of scattering random tidbits of history, scientific fact, literature references, language idioms, and famous quotations into a flood of the different ways we use our senses to perceive. Though some of these are fun and interesting, there are simply too many disconnected facts to keep it all straight. The narrative is sometimes beautifully written, but it becomes chopped up by small tangents and footnotes with unclear poignancy or necessity. The alternation between poetic narration and fact-dropping felt a bit too schizophrenic. Finally, some of the poetic forays became a bit tedious and saccharine.I do appreciate the idea and approach: our senses are all we have. How we blend them, use them, and interpret them is what makes this existence unique. By learning all about them individually we can take the time to wallow in the beauty of all that there is, of the wide array of possible ways of interpreting this infinitely complex universe.If there is one thing I'll walk away with is the notion of a ""sensualist"": that is, someone who takes immense pleasure and cognizance in the wide variety of ways of pleasing and tickling each of the individual senses. This helps us sop the most up from what we have around us: an awareness of all of the subtle flavours, sounds, tastes, and flickers that compose our world."

I may have another go some day, but it's one of the things I keep putting off.For one thing, I've never really accepted the canonical notion of 'five senses'. I kept waiting for discussion of the other senses. Where are the discussions of (for example) the barometric sense?For that matter, what about people with sensitivity outside the norm in the 'standard' five senses? Whenever I see people on news shows saying they can't assess the damage in storms until after sunrise, I respond ""Why not?"" I can see perfectly well even on cloudy nights, and I have all my other senses, as well. I can tell the difference between open and closed windows by the sound, I can tell when somebody's been outdoors in cold weather by the smell, I can tell whether a telvision is turned on (even with the sound turned down and from another room); and because of these and other sensory peculiarities, I always wonder why people assume that there's nobody who has senses outside the 'normal' range.It reminds me of my sister-in-law describing walking into a store with another of my brothers. Both of them flinched terribly at the very loud high-pitched sound in the store--but they weren't able to get anybody else to even hear it.I suppose there's a sort of intriguing interest in how other people perceive the world--but that's spoiled, in my opinion, by the assumption that it's the same for everybody. You DO have to explain what the common experience is--if it's not common to everybody. Riffing off what you assume is universal isn't much use--if you're speaking Greek to Sanskrit speakers. "

This book is so well-researched and clearly defined, with just slight deviations (but somehow connected) to each of the chapters that I was just as blown away by the unfolding 'story' as with what she packed into 300-page scientific exploration. It was a more fully-involved experience than Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life only in that his tangents were more winding whereas I can usually always see Ackerman's tangents logically leading to another point.The book is broken down into chapters about each individual sense. All have a sensual/sexual, very ethereal slant that was the majority of why I connected with her subheadings within each chapter, saw the progression between ideas, connections in her scientific analysis with her referencing other works and studies, and her willingness to explore. I have found myself referencing sections in conversations with others and know that I want to apply this knowledge in more than just cocktail conversations. I am just astounded by the topic AND the presentation. I think I need to own this. "

Trivia buffs and etymologists will especially enjoy this book. Having done a lot of reading in the area of vision in the past, I can say this book served as a stimulus to investigate the remaining senses further as well.If a tree falls over in the forest and there is no one around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Her writing flows lyrically, chronicling the five senses and how we perceive them in different situations; from the exotic to the mundane, from the erotic to the repulsive. Cutting a ⭐️ for two reasons : 1/ the epilogue and the chapter on synesthesia felt misplaced to me and 2/ the editing can be better at a few spots.

31,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

37,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."
38,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178314-tara,3,"I guess it's not really fair to say I read this book... I guess I read about 85% of this book. The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

I enjoy natural history (""The Hidden Life of Trees"", ""A Sting in the Tale"", ""Weeds: In Defense of Nature's Most Unloved Plants""), and I expected far more scientific discussion than I found here. As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery. At 66, I don't have time for poetic musings mixed with snippets of personal experience and cultural observation.

When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

54,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
55,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

61,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work. The implications are even if you got all the senses right, how they are processed (i.e. the poetry of her words) might still not be there. I sooo dig this lady."

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

67,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."
68,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178314-tara,3,"I guess it's not really fair to say I read this book... I guess I read about 85% of this book. The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

I enjoy natural history (""The Hidden Life of Trees"", ""A Sting in the Tale"", ""Weeds: In Defense of Nature's Most Unloved Plants""), and I expected far more scientific discussion than I found here. As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery. At 66, I don't have time for poetic musings mixed with snippets of personal experience and cultural observation. This blending in thirds made for page after rambling page with a scattering of scientific facts. I put it down 1/3 of the way through and felt relieved."

Such a curiosity about life! “The sensory misers will inherit the earth, but first they will make it not worth living on. When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

84,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
85,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

90,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,5,"a singularly saturated specimen of metaphoricall[iterat]ure, entirelessly enveloping, instructive in the art of loaded words."
91,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work. The implications are even if you got all the senses right, how they are processed (i.e. the poetry of her words) might still not be there. I sooo dig this lady."

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

97,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."
98,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178314-tara,3,"I guess it's not really fair to say I read this book... I guess I read about 85% of this book. The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery.

When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

114,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"

It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work. The implications are even if you got all the senses right, how they are processed (i.e. the poetry of her words) might still not be there. I sooo dig this lady."

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

127,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."
128,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178314-tara,3,"I guess it's not really fair to say I read this book... I guess I read about 85% of this book. The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

I enjoy natural history (""The Hidden Life of Trees"", ""A Sting in the Tale"", ""Weeds: In Defense of Nature's Most Unloved Plants""), and I expected far more scientific discussion than I found here. As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery. At 66, I don't have time for poetic musings mixed with snippets of personal experience and cultural observation.

When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

I think it is best, however, to approach Ackerman with no agenda. At times, I would get a little frustrated with some of the essays; ""what does sky have to do with sight?""

144,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"

It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

151,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work.

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

157,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."
158,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178314-tara,3,"I guess it's not really fair to say I read this book... I guess I read about 85% of this book. The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery. At 66, I don't have time for poetic musings mixed with snippets of personal experience and cultural observation.

When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

I think it is best, however, to approach Ackerman with no agenda. At times, I would get a little frustrated with some of the essays; ""what does sky have to do with sight?""

174,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"

It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."
179,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83996308-rusty-lacy,5,I read this book years ago and it still comes to mind.
180,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,5,"a singularly saturated specimen of metaphoricall[iterat]ure, entirelessly enveloping, instructive in the art of loaded words."
181,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work.

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

187,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."

The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

As Publishers' Weekly said, ""Physiology and philosophy mesh in this poetic investigation of the five senses,"" and that is what one gets - 1/3 physiology, 1/3 philosophy, and 1/3 poetry. The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery. At 66, I don't have time for poetic musings mixed with snippets of personal experience and cultural observation.

When you consider something like death, after which we may well go out like a candle flame, then it probably won’t matter if we try too hard, are awkward sometimes, care for one another too deeply, are excessively curious about nature, are too open to experience, enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly.” "

I think it is best, however, to approach Ackerman with no agenda. At times, I would get a little frustrated with some of the essays; ""what does sky have to do with sight?""

204,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
205,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

208,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15374665-phillip-kay,5,"Ever heard a song or smelt a perfume that took you suddenly and unexpectedly back to another time and place? ""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."
209,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83996308-rusty-lacy,5,I read this book years ago and it still comes to mind.
210,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,5,"a singularly saturated specimen of metaphoricall[iterat]ure, entirelessly enveloping, instructive in the art of loaded words."
211,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI. She is so relevant as a result.""Breaths come in pairs, except at two times in our lives - the beginning and the end.""""We breath 23,040 times and move 438 cubic feet of air.""p. 22 - ""Asian people don't have as many apocrine glands at the base of hair follicles as occidentals do..."" I didn't know that.p. 44-45 - I did not know that low pressure, which makes molecules evaporate faster, effect your perfume lasting longer. p. 73 - ""Massaged babies gain weight as much as 50% paster than unmassaged babies They are more active, alert, and responsive, more aware of their surroundings, better able to tolerate noise, and they orient themselves faster and are emotionally more in control."" p. 137 - In the section on taste... she goes into canabalism... wow... she went there... and wow... fascinating.p. 138 - 10,000 taste buds vs. rabbits have 17,000p. 163 - Her commentary/research on the benefits of ginger is dope.p. 217 - Music seems to produce emotional states that all people share, and as a result, it allows us to communicate our most intimate emotions without having to talk about or define them in a loose net of words.p. 253 onward - color and how the words are very different culture to culture. The black/white are the most basic, but after that, not so much.Brilliant work. The implications are even if you got all the senses right, how they are processed (i.e. the poetry of her words) might still not be there. I sooo dig this lady."

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."

The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day. For now it's on my shelf because I think it needs a break from the elements... and if I take it anywhere, it may just fall apart.(So now it belongs in the unfinishable category.)"

The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery.

234,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
235,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

240,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,5,"a singularly saturated specimen of metaphoricall[iterat]ure, entirelessly enveloping, instructive in the art of loaded words."
241,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI.

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."

It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it.

264,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
265,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."

270,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,5,"a singularly saturated specimen of metaphoricall[iterat]ure, entirelessly enveloping, instructive in the art of loaded words."
271,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,5,"Most people think of the mind as being located in the head, but the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn’t really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalogue as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision. We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die. Etymologically speaking, a breath is not neutral or bland—it’s cooked air; we live in a constant simmering. There is a furnace in our cells, and when we breathe we pass the world through our bodies, brew it lightly, and turn it loose again, gently altered for having known us.Smell is the most direct of all our senses. Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb or smell center. Such cells are unique to the nose. If you destroy a neuron in the brain, it’s finished forever; it won’t regrow. If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears, both organs will be irreparably damaged. But the neurons in the nose are replaced about every thirty days and, unlike any other neurons in the body, they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef.If there are words for all the pastels in a hue—the lavenders, mauves, fuchsias, plums, and lilacs—who will name the tones and tints of a smell? It’s as if we were hypnotized en masse and told to selectively forget. It may be, too, that smells move us so profoundly, in part, because we cannot utter their names. In a world sayable and lush, where marvels offer themselves up readily for verbal dissection, smells are often right on the tip of our tongues—but no closer—and it gives them a kind of magical distance, a mystery, a power without a name, a sacredness.Unlike the other senses, smell needs no interpreter. The effect is immediate and undiluted by language, thought, or translation. A smell can be overwhelmingly nostalgic because it triggers powerful images and emotions before we have time to edit them. What you see and hear may quickly fade into the compost heap of short-term memory, but there is almost no short-term memory with odors. Smells stimulate learning and retention. Can smells influence us biologically? Absolutely. Musk produces a hormonal change in the woman who smells it. As to why floral smells should excite us, well, flowers have a robust and energetic sex life: A flower’s fragrance declares to all the world that it is fertile, available, and desirable, its sex organs oozing with nectar. Its smell reminds us in vestigial ways of fertility, vigor, life-force, all the optimism, expectancy, and passionate bloom of youth. We inhale its ardent aroma and, no matter what our ages, we feel young and nubile in a world aflame with desire.Stumbling on new smells is one of the delights of travel. Early in our evolution we didn’t travel for pleasure, only for food, and smell was essential. Many forms of sea life must sit and wait for food to brush up against them or stray within their tentacled grasp. But, guided by smell, we became nomads who could go out and search for food, hunt it, even choose what we had a hankering for. In our early, fishier version of humankind, we also used smell to find a mate or detect the arrival of a barracuda. And it was an invaluable tester, allowing us to prevent something poisonous from entering our mouths and the delicate, closed system of our bodies. Smell was the first of our senses, and it was so successful that in time the small lump of olfactory tissue atop the nerve cord grew into a brain. Our cerebral hemispheres were originally buds from the olfactory stalks. We think because we smelled.Our blood is mainly salt water, we still require a saline solution (salt water) to wash our eyes or put in contact lenses, and through the ages women’s vaginas have been described as smelling ''fishy''. In fact, Sandor Ferenczi, a disciple of Freud’s, went so far as to declare, in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality, that men only make love to women because women’s wombs smell of herring brine, and men are trying to get back to the primordial ocean—surely one of the more remarkable theories on the subject. He didn’t offer an explanation for why women have intercourse with men. One researcher claims that this ''fishiness'' is due not to anything intrinsic to the vagina, but rather to poor hygiene after intercourse, or vaginitis, or stale sperm. ''If you deposit semen in the vagina and leave it there, it comes out smelling fishy,'' he argues. This has a certain etymological persuasiveness to it, if we remember that in many European languages the slang names for prostitutes are variations on the Indo-European root pu, to decay or rot. In French, putain; to the Irish, old put; in Italian putta; puta in both Spanish and Portuguese. Cognate words are putrid, pus, suppurate, and putorius (referring to the skunk family). Skunk derives from the Algonquin Indian word for polecat; and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England polecat was a derogatory term for prostitute. Not only do we owe our sense of smell and taste to the ocean, but we smell and taste of the ocean.In general, humans have a strong body odor, and anthropologist Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey thinks our ancestors may have had an even stronger odor, one that predatory animals found foul enough to avoid.There’s been so much anecdotal evidence about different races having distinctive odors—because of diets, habits, hairiness or lack of it—that such claims are difficult to discount, even though the topic scares most scientists, who are understandably concerned about being called racist. There hasn’t been a great deal of research into national and racial odors. In any case, one culture doesn’t ''smell'' better or worse than another, just different, but that may be why the word ''stinking'' so often appears as an adjective in streams of racial abuse. For those of exquisite sensuality, there is nothing headier than the musky smell of a loved one moist with sweat. But natural body odors don’t strike most of us as particularly enticing. In the Elizabethan Age, lovers exchanged ''love apples''—a woman would keep a peeled apple in her armpit until it was saturated with her sweat, and then give it to her sweetheart to inhale.George Preti, staged an experiment in which ten women had the sweat of other women applied under their noses at regular intervals. It took three months for the women to begin menstruating at the same time as the women whose sweat they were smelling. A control group, daubed with alcohol instead of sweat, didn’t change their cycles at all. Clearly, a pheromone in sweat affects menstrual synchrony, which is why women in dorms or close girlfriends so often menstruate at the same time, a phenomenon known as the McClintock Effect (after Martha McClintock, the psychologist who first observed it). There appear to be other effects.Salmon can smell the distant waters of their birth, toward which they must swim to spawn. A male butterfly can home in on the scent of a female that is miles away. Pity us, the long, tall, upright ones, whose sense of smell has weakened over time. When we are told that a human has five million olfactory cells, it seems like a lot. But a sheepdog, which has 220 million, can smell forty-four times better than we can. What does it smell? What are we missing? Yet, over time, smell has become the least necessary of our senses, “the fallen angel,” as Helen Keller dramatically calls it. Some researchers believe that we do indeed perceive, through smell, much of the same information lower animals do. In a room full of businesspeople, one would get information about which individuals were important, which were confident, which were sexually receptive, which in conflict, all through smell. The difference is that we don’t have a trigger response. We’re aware of smell, but we don’t automatically react in certain ways because of it, as most animals would.Women in general just have a stronger sense of smell. Perhaps it’s a vestigial bonus from the dawn of our evolution, when we needed it in courtship, mating, or mothering; or it may be that women have traditionally spent more time around foods and children, ever on the sniff for anything out of order. Because females have often been responsible for initiating mating, smell has been their weapon, lure, and clue.Read this book, this is just a tiny smell section. Other word senses will seduce you equally quickly. "

Excellent for those trying to understand the senses in a way that has more than that tactile logical feel. This is what we are trying to recreate!I am reading this b/c I think that data, vr, AI, etc... are all about trying to recreate the sensory input. Ackerman's expert ability to demonstrate how this is done in the beauty of language is unparalleled. Wow. If I could write like her! She's the kind of lady that if she was in your English class and read her essay, you'd just put your pen down and never write again, just outsource it all to her!My notes:p. 6 - Our sense of smell can be extraordinarily precise, yet it is almost impossible to describe how something smells to someone who hasn't smelled it. This is SOOOO Her point. Think of the implications to data & VR, let alone AI.

It is a book that discusses the five senses and dose a stellar job at igniting all of them. I particularly enjoyed the bits about smell and vision. This books was just so lavish with imagery that I was one hundred percent immersed in it. Ackerman just has such a poetic style and she makes the topic of the five senses truly worth reading. You learn a lot about smell, touch, taste, sound, and vision and you almost don't realize it because you are so swept away by the lush beauty within the pages of this book. In my opinion, it is the perfect book to read in your backyard on a warm spring day when the air is tinged with lilac and lily and the grass is spotted with dandelions. "

277,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,3,"The summer before my freshman year of college, Syracuse University mailed me a copy of this book and gently suggested I read it before arriving on campus. I was not in the habit of reading at the time, not even for school (in my entire secondary schooling I think I read four books as assignments, and not many more outside of school), so I thought nothing of it, and of course there were no consequences. I barely remember the book even being mentioned at SU, which probably means I tuned it out or avoided it, and yet I still managed to graduate cum laude. For some reason, I kept the book, and it was still on my shelf this past fall when my friend (and SU classmate) Cricket randomly reflected on it, and recommended it to me. Then it turned out two band buddies had the book on their to-read lists as well, so it was kismet.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were about the mechanics of the senses (how they work) and how they have evolved through time and through species. I found the references to pop culture interesting (what sensory experiences have gone in and out of fashion throughout history). She loses me when she goes off on a tangent about particular sensory experiences. She really goes off the rails in the chapter on vision, which is mostly about the sky, autumn leaves, and art. I'm sure her beautiful descriptive text is what many people love about her writing, but I guess I'm more of an interesting fact guy. The brief chapter on synesthesia touches on the topic, but then becomes a list of what writers do to inspire themselves. Vision and synesthesia are the last two chapters, so maybe I have to admit I was getting tired of the book by that point.Speaking of lists, she loves them. I have to say I don't mind them in retrospect (I write in lists all the time, although usually not in paragraph form), although while I was reading them I was often like, how long is this list going to be? I liked the book and I'll probably read her again, but based on my love for Mary Roach and Sarah Vowell, I think we all know what I'm really looking for in my non-fiction. That being said, Ackerman certainly isn't without her humor. I leave you with this snippet:A quiet, distinguished scientist friend, who has published two charming books of essays about the world and how it works, told me that his secret inspiration was ""violent sex."" I didn't inquire further, but noted that he looked thin."

The book itself went through a series of accidents... It got rained on, snowed on, coffee spilled on it... ran over, went through the laundry... you should see it. It truly looks USED in the true sense of the word. Anyway, at first I was in love with the writing, I thought it was fascinating. But by the end I was kind of tired of Ackerman's flowy over the top language usage and it seemed like every ""chapter"" was super-formulaic... that said, it's really interesting and there are things I really liked about it. Maybe I'll actually get around to finishing it some day.

The combination gave me indigestion. I want to learn about how the senses work, and their beauty and mystery revealed via a thorough grounding in scientific research and discovery.

I love these rambling, train-of-thought explorations of topics, so this book literally* reached out and grabbed me by the wrist when I came accross it in a used book store attached to a reclaimed building materials store in Charlotte, NC.Diane Ackerman runs through the senses one by one, from smell to vision, with illuminations from science, myth, literature and more. Both the world we percieve with our senses and the workings of those senses are under analysis here. There are no conclusions to be found in a book like this, it's just fun to swim in ideas for a while.*not literally"

I really wanted to focus on the senses and to read a more scientific perspective. The essays therein were more fluid than that.I've read other Ackerman books and have enjoyed them thoroughly. I think it is best, however, to approach Ackerman with no agenda. At times, I would get a little frustrated with some of the essays; ""what does sky have to do with sight?"" I found myself pondering these types of questions. "
283,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86502793-ok,5,"Phenomenal. Lyrical, lush, intellectual. A book for readers, writers, scientists, poets, and anyone who wants to inhabit more expansively the sensory field between one’s body and the world. Ackerman’s work on synesthesia and writing was stimulating and joyful to read. 5/5But then time has always been one of our boldest and most ingenious inventions, and, when you think about it, one of the least plausible of our dictions. - 281 ...to step above the Earth and see the whole world fidgeting and blooming below you. - 284"

Another one to jump into where the book falls open, not one i consumed from front to back. I enjoyed it tremendously and it awakened my perceptions for awhile, but lost interest in the middle of the Hearing section. My copy is well worn and appears to be soaked with water, oddly enough becoming a sensual document itself. Great reminder here. Maybe I'll pick it up again."
285,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3083001-audra-unabridged-chick,5,"This beautiful book explores the science behind our five senses in lush, sensual narrative. Ackerman is a poet and her lyrical abilities are seen in her writing: the reader experiences each sense with her. Apparently this is a companion book to a PBS series but it can be read without having seen the show. Highly recommended!"
286,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41716100-roma-giannina,3,"Started off strong, luscious, and incredibly visceral while informative and quirky. About 2/3 of the way through I maybe just got overstimulated and was just 'over' it. I don't know if it was the book or me, but I had to skip sections towards the end as they were noticeably off topic. Started off as 5 stars and trickled on down to 3 by the end. "
287,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/817278-jennifer,5,"A fascinating and exhilarating look at each of the five senses in turn. Ackerman darts around topics in a way that seems haphazard, but ends up feeling inspired at the end. She has a gift with language that makes everything seem more fresh when you put down the book."
288,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62591298-cindy,5,"Diane Ackerman's historical, scientific, and cultural journey through our senses is one of the most engaging books I've enjoyed. Her research, combined with her impeccable use of language brings the subject to light in a wonderful way. I was spellbound...and then would laugh out loud."

292,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"This is non-fiction, but it's full of creative imagery. It's about the senses, so it's not surprising. I like the focus on individual senses mingled with the author's personal responses and experiences. Scientific ideas and some history are blended in. It feels somewhat educational. I like being reminded of my own sensory experiences even though it's very centered around the author's experiences. Sometimes it reads like a travel journal. She's clearly led a privileged life. The book seemed to take a very long time to plow through. I've been busy living."
293,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31218417-lisa,4,"An incredible review of how and why and in what way we use or have used our senses through history. Full of facts and trivia that helps the world come together. As well, the best part, a partially first person non fiction book from a female perspective. Anecdotes are not from a He perspective but from a She perspective. I love it."
294,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,2,"	I bought this book a number of years ago because I was attracted by three things that normally do not lead me to purchase a book, especially not a new hardback. I was drawn to the title for the following reasons: 'senses' because I have only four – none of them particularly outstanding – and looked forward to someone explaining the fifth one to me in a way I could understand; 'natural' – who ever heard of unnatural senses; and 'history' so I could then explain to others that while a sense of smell was extremely important to our forefathers, in this antiseptic world we live in now, smell is an additive, not a primary. The dust cover also caught my attention as it projects more than a look, it covers (excuse the pun, or not) the sense of touch with its raised reproduction of the painting My sweet rose by which one can feel the braids in the lady's hair, the smooth length of her neck, and a hint of petals in the rose. She is holding the rose so close to her mouth as well as her nose that she appears to be tasting as well as smelling it. I would have expanded the portion of the painting to include more of the fountain on the far right so we could hear the garden as well but the original does not extend that far. The inside cover, both back and front, is lovely as well: a variety of greens used to imply ferns in an optical illusion of depth and a look which appears both satiny and velvety. A sensuous book and I hadn't even opened it beyond the inside covers.	Through moves and rearrangements of our numerous shelves, I fondled the book many times but deemed the time not quite right for reading. Now, however, during my first full year of teaching myself the art of writing and preparing for a second NaNoWriMo, a close look at the senses was precisely what I needed. 	I was pleasantly surprised to discover the first chapter was Smell, the sense I lack, hoping to learn what I was missing. Of course, as she soon states, smell cannot be defined except by other smells, or by the way ""they make us feel...disgusting, intoxicating, sickening, pleasurable, delightful, pulse-revving, hypnotic, or revolting."" Although I still can't 'feel' what a smell is like, the description helps, but as I think about it, I had already gotten that idea by watching people's facial expressions when sniffing something. She then categorized smell into categories. That helped a bit more, and two of them, minty and acrid, I have had the 'pleasure' of experiencing when the objects producing the odor is either in my mouth (peppermint gum) or very hot (boiling vinegar). I say 'pleasure' in single quotes because I didn't find it so, more of an odd sensation not to be repeated more often than necessary. The most useful description comes from J.E.Amoore's 'stereochemical' theory, that odor molecules have shapes which fit into specific neuron niche. No, the shapes don't cause me to understand the sensation of smell, but I can now visualize it, and somehow that is comforting. 	In any case I devoured the first forty pages or so. The profusion of the words, combined with her attempt to describe the indescribable, fascinated me and I admired her effort. At times her ideas seemed somewhat exaggerated and I wondered at the veracity (for example, did Napoleon really put violets from Josephine's grave in a locket which he then wore for the rest of his life? Who would know? Who would care?) but I read on eagerly...until page 45, in her discussion of Helen Keller. ""How someone blind and deaf from birth..."" But Helen Keller wasn't blind and deaf from birth. She became so after a serious illness at around a year and half. In fact, without the remnants of memory of sight and sound one could question if Anne Sullivan could have broken into her isolation and brought her into the world of communication. During the rest of my reading I was consumed by fact checking, which frankly, spoiled the book for me. And yes, there were other errors, or if not outright errors, unnecessary exaggerations. For example, her discussion of the idiom 'lighter than air' leads her to state that the atmosphere ""weighs 5,000 trillion tons"" and that only gravity is holding it to the earth. But, weight is defined by the pull of gravity, one cannot separate them into individual entities.	Ok, I am being picky. The author has a wonderful way with language and I learned much from her examples. Here's one showing how to use multiple senses in description: The cottony blue sky and dark-blue sea meet at a line sharp as a razor's edge. Why is it so thrilling to … hear waves crash against a rocky shore, blowing spray high into the air, as the seagulls creak? We not only see the scene, we can hear it, feel it, and from the spray, taste and smell it. I am glad I read this work although I wish I had not been distracted by problems. I also hope that what she says about writers and those suffering from anosmia is not true.	One of the real tests of writers, especially poets, is how well they write about smells. If they 	can't describe the scent of sanctity in a church, can you trust them to describe the suburbs of the 	heart?Does my anosmia doom me to be a bad writer?"
295,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60484820-karol-borrero,4,"this is my first Diane Ackerman read, she is something else. this book is packed with amazing facts and information about our senses, while at the same time full of prose and metaphors that only make it all the more enchanting. a great work for anyone researching on our human history. it also serves as a guide to know how and why we move through the world the way we do. It took me so long to finish, not because it was boring- but more so the interesting facts and information are a lot to take in so you might want to dwell on some pages/chapters/sentences multiple times. i felt like Ackerman made it her job to zoom you in and out, taking you through each of our 'known' senses, and then educating us about the universe. Fascinating details about micro organisms, and the infiniteness that is our world and beyond. i feel every human being should be required to read this book, it reminds us how 'in an odd way one-cell animals may have a more realistic sense of the world than higher animals do, because they respond to every stimulus the encounter. we, on the other hand, select only a few.... this makes our version of the world somewhat simplistic.' this book invites us to live in harmony with nature and to learn from it. all in all, diane ackerman, makes for so much information about our senses and their history a feast to read."

298,0679735666,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15374665-phillip-kay,5,"Ever heard a song or smelt a perfume that took you suddenly and unexpectedly back to another time and place? ""What is most amazing is not how our senses span distance or cultures, but how they span time. Our senses connect us intimately with the past, connect us in ways that most of our cherished ideas never could.""I've just finished reading A Natural History of the Senses, a book published in 1990 by Diane Ackerman, a poet and essayist who has gone on to publish two more books following the theme of this one. When I began I thought it as beautifully written and as profound as astronomer Chet Raymo's The Soul of the Night. Ackerman's book, like Raymo's, kindled my sense of wonder on almost every page.It is a book in which I sense two underlying assumptions. The first, following Thoreau's Walden, that we (all living matter) are very much a product of our environment, and a lot of our physiology has evolved to interpret that environment to our brain. Secondly, that we are now so mechanised, mere technoslaves, that we run the risk of losing that vital connection: once we ignore those signals from our senses about our environment we run the risk of being alienated from it, and alienation is the first step to mental unhealth. The experience of using our body in its normal, healthy state is in itself pleasurable. It is good to remember that life is not all stress and interpersonal pressure, not a shutting out of unpleasant 'facts' by our various addictions. Life is naturally a joyous state.So let's learn about our senses, but not in any conventional sense of learning, for this is not merely a compendium of facts about the senses but an attempt to encourage us to use our senses, to get us in touch with our feelings (sorry about the pun, but you see how close a tie our brain makes between our emotions and our senses).The book is divided into five sections, one for each sense, with an epilog which considers the synthesis of the senses and the existence of other senses such as are found in some animals. There are some good thoughts on how unique each species' view of the world is, how particular to our own species is our 'reality'. It is mind expanding to imagine the world as seen and experienced by a spider, for instance, or a cat. One is a little more readier to accept another human's differing viewpoint, for one thing.My edition was a well produced one (Chapman) with handcut pages, marbled endpapers, well-matched colours in the binding and an expressive jacket picture. It felt, looked and smelt enticing. (I love the smell of books).""...the latest findings in physiology suggest that the mind doesn't really dwell in the brain but travels the whole body on caravans of hormone and enzyme, busily making sense of the compound wonders we catalog as touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision."" The brain we usually think of (the 'grey matter') is part of a system, the nervous system,which occupies our entire body, and which enables us to react successfully to our surroundings. Finding the balance between sensation and analysis of that sensation is hard for us because of our 'big' brain; it parallels what psychologists, following Jung, call the swing between extrovert and introvert tendencies, or what moralists see as the choice between intellect and hedonism. Have you ever seen a plant move a leaf or a blossom to face the sun? It is a graceful and beautiful action: for us finding such a balance between sense and survival is not easy, and other life forms have much to teach us.We now study 'body language', unfortunately usually to find out how to make other people do what we want them to. But we respond to others' body language with our own, and much of what goes on goes on at a sensory level. Our much neglected sense of smell, for instance, tells us how others are feeling, gives guidance as to the dominance structure of a group and help us to find a sexual mate.Ackerman's book is not a book on science, but a book that demonstrates what science is for.It is a book that I want to read again, soon. Much of the book's fascination comes from Ackerman's writing itself, the simple and direct style that reveals herself and her feelings as well as explains scientific findings and describes the natural world and human customs and history in poetic images and metaphors. Her lateral cast of mind can find the connections between humans and the world in which we live through mediators such as pheronomes, evolution, the behavior of Monarch butterflies, Cleopatra and Egyptian perfumes, the colour range of insects, the deer who come to her garden, the space shuttle and a thousand other fascinating examples."
