0,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,4,"Moondust: In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth is a unique account by the journalist Andrew Smith, recording the experiences of the 9 remaining astronauts who went to the moon. As he says:""Of over 400 people who have now been into Space, only 27 have ever left Earth's orbit and seen her from the perspective of Deep Space - all American and all between the Christmases of 1968 and 1972."" In 2005, Andrew Smith realised that there would only be a short time left for this account to be written from their perspectives. Only a dozen astronauts had actually landed on the Moon. The majority of the Apollo astronauts merely orbited it. Of those twelve, three had died, and the rest were ageing. The youngest was Charlie Duke, of Apollo 16, and he was 69. He reports:""I wondered whether the Moonwalkers had reconciled themselves to being Earthbound; whether they'd made peace with their world or continued to mourn their strangled hopes.""Andrew Smith brings his own experience of the Moon programme to bear on the story, making it part autobiography, part biography and part social, political and cultural commentary. This projects us right inside, because not only is the experience shared by all of us who remember that time, it is also what NASA and the media wanted us to experience. Most of the astronauts reported one common experience, which was an awareness of how insignificant humans were. Neil Armstrong remembered standing on the Moon, and noticing he could blot out the Earth with his thumb. Surely that must have made him feel really big. But ""No,"" he replied, ""It made me feel really, really small.""This emotional reaction was repeated over and over again, as all nine astronauts were deeply affected by experiencing such a unique perspective of Earth, and one admits to breaking down in tears on the Moon's surface. Here's yet another:“When I review my travels among the astronauts, my mind's eye goes first to the Houston shopping mall where Alan Bean sat for hours after returning from space, just eating ice cream and watching the people swirl around him, enraptured by the simple yet miraculous fact they they were there and alive in that moment, and so was he.” The book is always interesting, both in detailing the early experiences of the astronauts and reporting their later years. It is startling to learn how wildly differently the individual astronauts have reacted and now behave. John Young, from Apollo 16, later flew the first space shuttle. In his interview he apparently directed every remark to the wall behind Andrew Smith! Neil Armstrong, whose reticence in interviews was famous, offered to send a few emails, plus some details of his mission's technical parameters. Nothing else was forthcoming. Buzz Aldrin's alcoholism became infamous. A fellow astronaut commented:""He resents more not being the first man on the Moon more than he appreciates being the second This could perhaps explain the absence of lunar pictures of Neil Armstrong. Even when Buzz Aldrin was specifically asked to take a photograph, he refused to take a single one of his commander, claiming that he was ""too busy"".Charlie Duke, from Apollo 16, also became an alcoholic, filled with such rage that he bullied both his wife, Dotty, and children until they found God, or as Andrew Smith puts it: ""eventually becoming the Lord's Sonny and Cher"".Other astronauts had also had quasi-religious experiences. Ed Mitchell said that when he returned in his Apollo 14 capsule, he glimpsed ""an intelligence in the Universe and felt connected to it"". This led to him setting up the ""Institute of Noetic Sciences"". On googling this, one finds some very strange stuff indeed. Al Bean of Apollo 12 gave up flying to become an artist. However he also seems obsessed by his experience, and only ever paints variations on one scene - the lunar surface. Jack Schmitt, of Apollo 17, became a Republican Senator. However, he only lasted one single term in office. It must admittedly be wearing to be asked, what is it like to walk on the Moon? How can anyone answer such a question? Andrew Smith reports that the late Pete Conrad, of Apollo 12, merely gave the same snappy answer every time, saying: ""Super! Really enjoyed it!""But the opposite end of the spectrum reveals the saddest case of all. David Scott, of Apollo 15, was disgraced for smuggling stamped letters to the Moon. His reputation was in tatters, and then to seal his fate, the ""Daily Mail"" newspaper reported him having an affair with the newsreader Anna Ford, five years before this book was published. This all seems very censorious and poignant to modern eyes, especially since his plan to sell the letters was not actually illegal, if not strictly conducted openly. But it was intended to raise cash to send his children through college, which he could never have managed on his astronaut's salary. Incredible as it may sound, the Apollo astronauts were simply paid the same rate as they had been when in the army! They were paid just $8 a day, minus deductions for their free bed on the Apollo mission. Buzz Aldrin still had a framed receipt on his wall, which says: ""From Houston to Cape Kennedy, Moon, Pacific Ocean. Amount claimed: $33.31."" The circumstances surrounding the early trips make for surprising reading too. These men seemed to have little in common, except that fact that they were all either eldest siblings or only sons. Interestingly, but perhaps not significantly, they nearly all chose Country and Western tapes to play on their Apollo voyages, and, of course, they all walked on the Moon. But having created these superheroes who were carted round in a jeep afterwards, and used to glorify the USA, NASA paid them off with a pittance. They were then dumped, and left to struggle with the physical, emotional and possibly spiritual consequences of their fame. Not one of them was properly equipped to deal with his ""fall back to Earth"". What could they possibly do with rest of their lives, once they had been to the Moon? However, this is a very unusual and fascinating collective biography. Written by a journalist, it is competent, and shows both compassion and humour. Andrew Smith describes the Apollo programme as:""the most mind-blowing theatre ever created"".Even if it did not tell us much we did not know about the Moon, what comes across is the way it has provided many insights into how we look at ourselves. These Apollo lunar missions have been called ""the last optimistic act of the 20th century"". And the enormous achievement of landing on the Moon did make us think, for a while, that anything was possible.“Was Apollo worth all the effort and expense? If it had been about the Moon, the answer would be no, but it wasn't, it was about the Earth. The answer is yes. The only thing I can't see in all this is a rationale for going back. Unless we could find a way to take everyone.”NOTE:The nine astronauts speaking in this book were:Neil ArmstrongBuzz AldrinCharlie DukeJohn YoungEd MitchellAl BeanJack SchmittPete ConradDavid Scott"
1,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I'm finding it hard to write this review. Not due to the book at all, just due to my own problems. I listened to the audio book of this the last couple of weeks at the gym. And it was very entertaining and interesting, it kept me at the gym for longer than I would have listening to music. But I'd class my audio comprehension as slightly retarded. That styrofoam ball that my sister dared me to shove up my nose when I was six never came back out. I have a feeling that the section of my brain that deals with audio input consists of something that floats really well and responds to static electricity like crazy.This is the style of non-fiction investigation books that I love. It's the same style as Mary Roach and Will Storr in that it is written as a personal investigation filled with interviews and encounters with people close to the subject. Here the journey starts when Andrew learns of the death of one of the Apollo astronauts and hears the news say ""And now there are only nine left"". This get's him thinking of what happens when there are none left, how the nine who are left have changed and are dealing with their strange pasts and what has humanity gained from this strange enterprise that occurred 40 years ago.The main body of the work consists of interviews with Apollo astronauts, the history of their missions and personal accounts by the author of the history and time that these events occurred within. All of the astronauts are fascinating and different, each have lead a different path since getting back home. All of them had changed as a result of the trip. But this isn't just a book full of the words of the astronauts. Andrew has filtered them (some needed filtering) and tried to get to the essence of each personality and what makes these men tick. And in a larger way, what made the Apollo program tick, the United States at the time tick, and even the world. It seems like a big task, but Andrews astute observations resonate and have great meaning, despite approaching the problem from a humanistic as opposed to scientific way. And he made a scientist like myself understand what he was talking about without me shutting off and thinking that it was all just airy-fairy liberal arts talk. I really wish I could put some quotes in here to give you an idea of how switched-on Andrew is, but I don't have the book in front of me. There is no question that I think this is a great book and I'm ordering a copy of it on my next book purchase. Not only to have a copy for myself (the audiobook was from the library), but to actually sit down and read this with my full attention. I feel that only then can I write a fitting review and a fitting score. This read could well be a 5-star read, and I have a sneaking suspicion that it will be. So I guess the message that you can all take away from this is that it is a brilliant read that could possibly be a top-notch read. It looks at the Apollo program from a humanistic approach and is full of wit, insight and respect. I just hope I can do it the justice of a more accurate and deserving review next time.EDIT (5 minutes later): SCREW IT I'M GIVING IT 5 STARS."
2,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5456932-tony,4,"Taking a slightly different approach to chronicling the moon landings, the author tracks down and interviews the remaining “moonwalkers” about how they got there, what it felt like, and how they adapted to life back down here. The result is a fascinating mix: a non-linear history of the moon landings, combined with some social history, travel writing, and a dose of autobiography. It’s also quite a thoughtful book, musing on the significance of the moon landings (and the whole space programme), hoax theories, and the possible future of spaceflight. "
3,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780356-cira,5,"First, let's lament the unfortunate cover of this new edition. Here's the old one:Okay, onward: I actually read each chapter at least twice before moving on. I've never done a neurotic escapade like that with a book before, but I didn't want it to end.Part memoir, part essayist account, part historic narrative (the description of the Eagle landing here is the best, sorry Andrew Chaikin), Moondust is more than a search for the last surviving men who walked on the moon. It's also NOT a technological history, and I find those criticisms of the book unwarranted - this is a cultural analysis and it should be evaluated as such. There are so many accounts and reports of the engineering side of things (there is actually an entire book on just the statistics of the Apollo project), so you can get your fix elsewhere for how much memory the 1964 Block I prototype of the AGC had. We know that cultural depictions of the Apollo program and its astronauts are oversaturated with idealization to a blinding level (cue the opening credits of From the Earth to the Moon), yet they're just so pervasive, aren't they? We put a flag on the moon! The ubiquity of this image and it's meaning has been sterilized and packaged again and again as a succinct summation of the whole process. Even Neil deGrasse Tyson's recent heralded book provided a bland glossed-over treatment of the Apollo program. Now, in 2013, all those incredible 50th anniversaries will steadily accelerate in frequency and then suddenly stop, coupled with the inevitable death of the last remaining 'original' astronauts. Time to start reconciling.The Space Race has largely evaded (popular) criticism; an astounding feat in an era filled with textbook case studies of civil and technological drama. However, the glories of the Space Race, and Apollo in particular, occupy a steadfast place in the American mythos. Going to another world is an absolute symbol of modernity, but for all its perceived optimistic advancement, the astronaut's tale is a sad story indeed. Amidst the default appliqué of astronaut grit and glamour, Smith conveys the shared contemplative melancholy of the moonwalker with a pizazz Tom Wolfe would admire. The bleakness of the moon is comparable only to the science fiction conventions and Scenes From A Reno Hotel Bar. But it's not just about the astronauts, of course not. It's about all of us and the embedded exploratory nature that humans cannot shake; the desire and need for the hero pioneer and the Promethean outcome of it all. Manifest destiny as a space opera is a straightforward outward expansion, but the subsequent inward transformation of the explorer is much more nuanced - and this is where Smith's interpretation excels. He isn't simply de-heroifying the astronauts or chalking the Space Race up to Cold War muscle flexing or unfettered idealism. No; Apollo, and it's place in our collective memory, is much more complicated than that. In markedly few words, Smith is able to convey these tensions without resorting to cliche: outwardly, nationalistic ambitions and courage; inwardly, profoundly intimate disappointment and awe. If this makes it seem like the book's an existential despair fest (the best kind of fest), it's not. The great thing about the Space Race is the absurdity of it all - both in its lunacy (!) and Capital-A Camus Absurdity. Smith writes candidly about the depths of his wonder, ranging from arbitrary to profound and back again. His search for meaning diverges from the common narratives that we all know, and that's what makes this book spectacular. As he goes from interview to interview, his chattering internal monologue captures this conflict. And you can't help but feel that the astronauts are equal parts flattered and amused to be caught up in it all (except maybe Charlie Duke). It's with the gonzo journalism slant that Smith is able to ask the question that is never, but desperately needs to be, asked: WTF was that?"
4,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11004626-gwern,4,"Gonzo-light style book by a music journalist on trying to meet the surviving 9 astronauts who walked on the moon, discuss it and their post-moon lives, and draw Deep Lessons. Prompted by the interesting review of it in the LRB (""What did you expect? The banality of moon-talk"").Smith strives very hard to contextualize the short interviews/encounters, often unsuccessfully, bouncing between a frustrating amount of padding, the history, and very short snippets from the actual interviews - he is particularly baffled by Armstrong, getting out of him only the interesting tidbit that Armstrong packed with him an album of theremin music (fittingly enough), concluding that Armstrong must have deep mysteries indeed (although the more parsimonious explanation would be that Armstrong is pretty much what he seemed). The straining continues with the other astronauts, with Smith ultimately more or less agreeing with ""Alan Bean's view that all the Moonwalkers came back 'more like they already were'"" - the New Age astronaut who tried to do ESP experiments from orbit* indeed continued to dabble in New Age and psi and other sorts of futility, the uncommunicative Armstrong remained uncommunicative, the hilariously and endearingly Aspergery John Young remained Aspergery, etc. The most interesting one is definitely Alan Bean, who feels he was kept so busy during his brief lunar sojourn that he failed to truly appreciate it and has since devoted his time to painting the Moon in pieces like ""That's How It Felt to Walk On The Moon"" in order to regrasp the experience.One possible regularity Smith notes in talking to them is that personality-wise, the disgraced David Scott might be onto something in identifying role and personality as moderators of the ""overview effect"":The Apollo 15 commander spent two days drifting home from the Moon with a man who had (or felt he had) heard God calling to him there - Jim Irwin - and I want to know whether the crew discussed this at all?The reply comes quickly. ""No, there wasn't really time, we were too busy doing the science."" And through the pause which follows, I'm thinking, ""Oh well, I tried."" But then Scott continues.""That's an interesting question, though, because Jim was deeply affected. For instance, before the Moon, he was a good speaker, but afterwards he was a great one. He really believed. Something real happened to him."" He then speaks about something which he called his ""left seat-right seat"" theory, referring to the fact that the commander stood to the left in the lander with the Lunar Module pilot on his right. He sounds reflective for the first time as he notes: ""The six guys in the left seat went down paths you'd have expected, but the six in the right seats went off in all kinds of unexpected directions.""And I suddenly recall Ed Mitchell saying something similar. In fact he had a name for it. I'd asked whether he thought some of the Moonwalkers had been more open to the experience than others and he answered:""Well, one thing to note is that most of the guys who were vocal about the depth of the experience were Lunar Module pilots. It's known phenomenon, from military studies, that the guy in the rear seat of a two-seater aircraft and the guy actually doing the flying have different experiences, because they're focussed on different things. It's the command phenomenon. The view of the guy who has to be alert and on top of things is different from the guy who's just along for the ride. So those of us coming back from the Moon who were LM pilots, we weren't just along for the ride - we had chores - but we didn't have major responsibilities, because the spacecraft was functioning well. We could take it in and contemplate what we were doing more thoroughly."" He further added: ""I think that was also true for people back home on Earth, though obviously in a different way. Those pictures of the Earth from the Moon are the most published pictures in the world. And so one has to ask the question: Why is that so? What is that? And to me, it's because they speak to that spirit of quest that humans have. And to the question 'Who are we? '""Yes. Now Scott is talking about Ed and his noetic quest, and Buzz Aldrin with his postflight breakdown ... and Alan Bean with his Close Encounters Moon art ... and of course Charlie Duke and Jim Irwin, who were directly or indirectly led to their faiths by the Moon. Only Jack Schmitt followed a straight and normal path, and then only if you consider a desire to enter the Senate normal. And for the first time, I fall to reflecting on my own encounters with these men; on the LM pilots' eagerness to communicate what they'd felt up there and the way it seemed to still live inside them, as against the by-turns maddening and amusing imperviousness of the surviving mission commanders. Armstrong, Young, Cernan, Scott: I can admire them all in different ways, but wouldn't want them near me if I were a talk-show host or composer of sonnets. Afterwards, I go to find Scott, because I want to know whether he thinks this postflight divergence is attributable to the different experiences of the Moonwalkers - as he seemed to be implying - or whether Deke simply assigned them roles according to character type, with focus and singularity seen as the stuff of leadership....""No, character doesn't come into it,"" he says. Really? I ask, but he shakes his head firmly. ""Character was never an issue."" So he agrees with Ed Mitchell that there was something primal in the experience, at least for those who had the time and mental space to be affected by it? ""I think so. Yes."" He leaves a short gap, as though considering this for the first time. ""It's interesting, isn't it?""Yes, I agree, it is - even though by this stage of my travels I can no longer believe it to be true. I think Deke Slayton chose his commanders precisely for their rarefied focus and tightly reined imaginations; for their relative immunity to doubt, ambivalence and vacillation - states that arise from sensitivity to one's situation, but might also delay decisions by the split second that turned success to anguish. What Slayton wanted was impregnability. Many of the commanders appear to be fine men, but it seems to me unlikely that they were ever going to become painters or preachers or poets or gurus, or have much to say about the metaphysical resonance of their journey....We pass through money and families and end up at Schmitt the scientist’s different take on the divorces, with him pointing out: “Because it was obviously frowned on for a long time, there were no divorces at first. And then there was some pent-up demand, of course, that finally occurred. But remember, you’re dealing with a fairly specialized selection of Americans. Most of them were only sons or eldest sons in Apollo, and they almost all exhibited what psychiatrists, I think, would call ‘Type A’ personality traits. And so you have to evaluate everything that they’ve done since or during that time against that kind of a general personality background.”And I say: My God! Why didn’t I notice this earlier? When I get home, I call some psychologists and they recommend a book called Born to Rebel by Frank Sulloway, who sees families as “ecosystems in which siblings compete for parental favour by occupying specialized niches.” In his view, the strategies required of these niches become major influences on personality formation. It’s a startling fact that every Moonwalker I’ve met has been either an eldest sibling or only son. More astonishingly still, this will turn out to hold true for them all. Is that what brought them here? Driven, work-obsessed, time-obsessed, fiercely competitive, prone to stress-induced heart disease … Type A. As the eldest of three sons, this produces a particular queasiness (bordering on panic) in me. At any rate, the Type A thesis would chime with the competitiveness Gene Cernan and others have described in the Astronaut Office – though Schmitt, another only son, takes a typically rational and somewhat different view of this, too, averring: “It wasn’t so vicious, because nobody quite knew how Deke Slayton picked his crews.”...I ask whether Schmitt thinks that going to the Moon changed him, repeating Alan Bean’s view that all the Moonwalkers came back “more like they already were,” and his face lights up. He says he didn’t know that Bean had said that, but it’s exactly what he, too, has felt for the last thirty years. The only one who went in a direction no one could have imagined, he suggests, was the Apollo 15 commander, David Scott, whose lustrous career was destroyed by the “stamp scandal” which overtook him a few months after his return: a storm which broke over NASA’s discovery that he and his crew (LM pilot Jim Irwin and CM pilot Alfred Worden) had smuggled 400 commemorative envelopes to the Moon, then sold them to a stamp dealer for a profit of around $6,000 per man. There was nothing illegal in this, but it was against regulations and the crew were canned, with the incident following Scott like a toxic cloud ever after, because he was the commander and thus forced to shoulder the responsibility. Over the three decades which followed he would become the most evasive of all the astronauts, including Armstrong. I find his story intriguing and a little scary.Not being an Apollo buff, I learned many interesting little bits. For example, the first landing was nearly a disaster due to computer issues, excess lunar dust, and a pipe getting jammed & nearly exploding; going to the bathroom in space was so horrifying one astronaut simply didn't do it at all by taking Imodium to cause constipation; John Young fell down repeatedly while cavorting on the moon and immortalized himself by radioing back to Earth, ""I got the farts agin. I got 'em agin, Charlie.""; Buzz Aldrin, while suffering from a peculiar phobia in which he is unable to write things and still upset about Armstrong breaking Apollo tradition by insisting on being first out, still invented the lunar cycler; David Scott, cashiered for smuggling postal covers onto the moon to resell, was probably unjustly persecuted as other astronauts had brought things to the moon as well (in part because they were paid next to nothing (Aldrin keeps his travel expenses from Apollo framed: ""PAYEE’S NAME: Col. Edwin E. Aldrin 00018 / FROM: Houston, Texas / TO: Cape Kennedy, Fla. / Moon / Pacific Ocean / AMOUNT CLAIMED: $33.311""), and couldn't even get life insurance); in Nepal, the astronauts would be asked constantly if they had seen peoples' dead relatives on the moon; selection of astronauts was capricious and done at the whims of a resentful former pilot with a heart condition (although given his mother ""used to tie him to a tree at the age of four to stop him from running into the road"", one suspects his grounding might've been a good thing); Armstrong only got the first moon landing due to the deaths of several astronauts ahead of him; Apollo 12 was hit by lightning while launching and NASA feared the parachute was permanently broken, but let them continue to the Moon because they might as well if they were doomed; most of the astronauts make little money but the orbiters in the command module make far less than the ones who actually walked on the moon, although the experience of orbiting the dark side of the moon helped make up for the resentment of coming so close but not landing; the ongoing problems of fake moon dust being peddled by con artists (fake because legally, only the US government is allowed to own/sell moon dust before 2014); a major finding in panspermia, that bacteria can survive a trip to the Moon, was caused by a worker sneezing into the Surveyor camera; Aldrin & Armstrong had great trouble planting a flag in the sharp hart lunar dust/soil and were terrified it would fall while being videotaped; early in NASA history, it was almost 20% British (50% of the engineers), scooped up from a bankrupt Canadian aircraft manufacturer; of a number of sad moments, the saddest may be one recording in an album of space program audio records, Flight to the Moon, where White is space-walking and Grissom orders him back in, White stalling, finally saying ""This is the saddest moment of my life"", both of them dying just months later in the Apollo 1 fire and never making it to the moon; Dennis Tito noting presciently that anyone wanting to go to the ISS in 2005 should do so as soon as possible as it would never be cheaper (proving to be right, in spades, as the price went up 10x in the years afterwards before Russia shut it down entirely in 2010); an astronomer getting excited over photos of ejected urine, asking what it was, and being told it was the ""constellation Urion""; NASA seriously considered sending an astronaut on a one-way mission and then trying to pick him up years later when they figured that part out (which reminds me of some of the debates over how to do a manned Mars mission); and neither JFK nor Nixon really wanted Apollo, with JFK picking it up as a spur-of-the-moment desperate response to Russia and later backpedaling and proposing a joint program with the Russians; and in 1980, Americans spent more playing 
Space Invaders
 than they did on the space program.* Smith notes that due to a scheduling mishap, Edgar Mitchell's attempt to communicate in orbit using ESP with partners back on earth was incorrectly timed, but in Mitchell's defense, Daryl Bem has demonstrated that mere time is no barrier to ESP, so there's no reason to critique it on those grounds!"
5,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7159980-jenny-border-dweller,5,"This is a book about people rather than technology, or rather, the impact of technology on people. Those looking for a detailed and factual account of the Apollo Moon Landings will be disappointed. Those, like me, who know the official narrative but want answers to the questions no-one thought to ask, will love it.The basic premise of the book is simple: what does it do to a man to leave earth and stand on another world? To answer this question, the author interviews the remaining ""moonwalkers"", their colleagues and families and the results are always interesting and often surprising.The selection and training programme for Apollo overwhelmingly favoured the high achieving thrill seekers, prosaic men who were not given to introspection. Such men may be expected to take even something as profound as walking on the moon in their stride, and for the most part they did. But none were unaffected by their experiences.Those who had latent artistic or intuitive attributes were changed forever, one becoming a full time artist and two veering off into different types of religion. Nonetheless I was left with the feeling that by sending jock test-pilots to the moon, mankind missed out on a unique opportunity. To read these practical, here-and-now men fumbling to describe what it felt like to look back on earth, to walk on the moon, to be so profoundly isolated was rather like hearing a blind-from-birth man trying to describe colours. These men, through no fault of their own, did not have the capacity to reflect on or abstract from their experiences. They did not succeed in creating meaning from what they had done, though it was clear that in their own way, each of them had been on a lifelong quest to do so ever since.This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in people and ideas. It raises many more questions than it answers, and that is its strength. A beautifully written book to engage with on many levels."
6,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"Despite having a slightly contrived aim (the author decided he wanted to track down the nine remaining men, at time of writing, who had walked on the surface of The Moon) and despite me not being a gigantic super-fan of astronomy, I did enjoy this book and find it interesting. Another random punt picked up from a charity shop proving to be a very good choice.The main strength of the book is the writing. In another author's hands interviews with a series of American men in their sixties/seventies might've been a bit dull - esp. considering there's plenty of similarities between the biographies and natures of the (many ex-military, many engineering background) men involved. Smith puts it all in historical and cultural context, and succeeds in fleshing out the facts of the moon landings with a certain depth and humanity, without getting too bogged down in science or too carried away with new-age and spiritual considerations of the time. Plenty to stimulate further interest."
7,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795695-jennifer-ozawa,5,"This book does something that most other books about the space race don’t manage to do: make the men who went to the moon seem human. Those men are heroes, but they’re people and I want to know about them. This is a chronicle of a crazy road trip that brought the author close to the men involved in the Apollo mission. I loved meeting the astronauts, but I loved reading about Smith’s adventures too, especially seeing him as a Brit finding out more about his adopted country. He’s funny and his voice is friendly and familiar. "
8,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257940-chris,1,"What an awful, boring book. Shame really. Space is my favourite subject. I tried to read it, I really did but it just dragged on and on. "
9,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1453295-john,5,"After the death of Pete Conrad in a motorcycle accident, Smith sets out to interview the nine Apollo moonwalkers who are still alive. In his interviews, Smith focuses on discovering how the astronauts were changed by their trip to the moon, and what the trip meant to them. And while the interviews are fascinating (I was born too late to appreciate the Apollo program while it was happening, but I was obsessed with it in the last few years of the seventies, as the program's crazy glory faded and it became clear that we were probably never going back to the moon) Smith's own meditations on the waning years of the sixties and his own life are equally interesting. There are probably better books about the history of the Apollo program out there, but I thought this one was damn good."
10,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Between July 1969 and December 1972, an handful of men lived an exceptional experience, incredible, inspiring and how enviable: walking the surface of the moon. Andrew Smith went on decades later to go and meet them to try and know, not only what became of them, but, also and above all, how they might have been affected by such an odyssey on a deeply human level.From Neil Armstrong retiring from public life to Alan Bean turning artist whose pictures reflect his obsession with lunar landscapes; from Buzz Aldrin who had to fight depression and alcoholism to Jim Irwin, having left NASA to become a pastor; or, again, Edgar Mitchell, him too trying to conciliate science and religion with his New Age movement IONS (Institute of Noetic Science) here's way more than a collective biography of men out of the ordinary. Here's also, indeed, a book leaving thoughtful about our eventual (if at all!) future in space. Thing is, will we go back to the moon? Are we ready to send people on Mars? Behind the enthusiasm created by such potential adventures, pierces the bitterness coming with now living in absurdly risk-averse societies, plagued by bureaucracies and red tapes, and where political short term thinking leaves no space for dreams. The parallels with the daring spirit of the 1960s, that Andrew Smith describes here brilliantly, cannot but strike whose dreaming about the stars... No, not everything was solely about beating the Russians to their own game!Sadly, too, as the author keeps reminding again an again, the fact is that those men are also a dying breed; and so we are not far of from the time when not one being on this planet will left having experienced such an extraordinary deed - leaving the orbit of the Earth to walk an extra-terrestrial land. It might be a bit bitter, but, still, 'Moondust' , portraying a few admirable astronauts reflecting what mankind is capable to achieve, remains a wonderful read! "
11,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/408190-sisterimapoet,3,I found the author far more interesting that the astronauts. I liked his speculations of why we are fascinated with the moon. I liked his thoughts on how the moon landings fitted in with history at the time. I like his reflections on his childhood. I loved the thoughts of proximity and distance that this book prompted.
12,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56417304-lapetitesouris,5,There is nothing to say aside from this book is absolute magic and you should all read it. Beautifully written and captivating from start to finish. I didn't want it to end.
13,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069314,4,"Find my personal ‘Quote of the Book’ on pg.319::  “Pete Conrad used to defuse the question [of what was it like to stand on the Moon] by answering “Super! Really enjoyed it!”.”Then place a bookmark on pg 32 where a crew list for the Apollo missions (11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17) which reached the surface of the Moon can be found. Further detailed information is to be found in the Appendix at the back of Michael Collins’ superb 1974 book “Carrying The Fire”. If you’re reading either of the 2006 or 2009 Bloomsbury paperbacks; the pagination is identical.Right, now let’s go …It is firstly important to grasp is a sense of perspective. The Space Shuttle patrolled a mere 200 miles above earth. Project Apollo was of a different order of magnitude entirely; travelling 240,000 miles into deep space to reach our planet’s Moon. It was only from Apollo that the entirety of our round, blue, world was seen, hanging there without a picture hook, in Space. By contrast, the Space Shuttle has, alas, though importantly, been but an interesting earth-tethered experiment in the feasibility of generating commercial interest in Space.To me, the strength of Andrew Smith’s book lies in the clear and shining proof of his structured, gentle, but insatiable, curiosity. But I so nearly didn’t get there. This book begins with his childhood memories, living in California, of the day that Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. I have both heard and read to saturation point too many individual memories of the genre “Where I was, and what I was doing, when X happened”: admittedly where X is most commonly the death of John Lennon, or of Diana, Princess of Wales, or of JR Ewing; or of ….. NO MORE. PLEEEESE!!!I was also less than enthusiastic when, by now feeling thoroughly uncomfortably unsettled, I sensed that the direction of this book just might be heading off towards nothing much more than a predictable series of trite interviews with a gaggle of astronauts.How wrong could I have been? And what IS the collective noun for astronauts?Smith’s writing developed and began to stalk me. Here I found a man who seemed almost as interested in the tech of Project Apollo (and mention of Mercury & Gemini) as in the makeup of the astronauts. I smiled at his description of Dick Gordon [Command Module Pilot (CMP), Apollo 12]) on pg 82: “He talks about space the way your neighbour might discuss aphids over the garden fence.” he discusses the engineers, and other staff at NASA; and the politics of it all (Moon first, safety (almost) last: pg 150: “The Lunar Module [LM] has been compared to a Stradivarius violin in the artfulness of its design and construction, but its fuel oxidiser was one of the most corrosive substances on Earth. A miniscule leak and the ‘Eagle’ [Apollo 11] would eat itself.”). Smith has a certain way with words. At the end of his book, returning to a discussion of the politics of Project Mercury, he portrays that extraordinary time with an example of wonderful clarity and insight, pg.336:: “… the pilots couldn’t believe it when this steady approach [Boeing’s X-20 orbital plane] was sacrificed to the idea of farting a man into the sky, then scooping him up from the sea as he bobbed about like a helpless infant in his turkey-foil romper suit.” How I laughed! Then on pg.220: the seemingly rhetorical question ‘will man return [to the Moon] today?’ is posed. Smith thinks not; justifying his assertion that taxpayers in a democracy will refuse to pay the prohibitive costs for, amongst other things, considerably improved safety.Smith’s observations on 1960s bathtub technology continue. Between the covers of this book is a visit to those peak Meccano days which I thoroughly enjoyed. Choice delights (a delight is one where tragedy did not result) are laid out; such as that on pg 48: where I learnt of the significant extent of reliance placed on physical, as opposed to modern digital, technologies. As events later proved that was no bad thing. During the return of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module [LM] Eagle to the Command Module [CM] Columbia, Buzz Aldrin inadvertently broke the key which armed the ascent engine. Only quick thinking, and a pen jammed into the lock, saved the mission. But there again, it should not be overlooked that on pg.195: the reader is informed that the computer on board the ‘Eagle’ had a memory of just 36KB. That’s a fraction of the 1 GB RAM contained in an Apple i-phone 5 today (2013).Timbre changes through this book. I fell quiet as I absorbed the consequences from pg. 143: a lesson from a British Royal Air Force pilot flying with the Red Arrows: “ He also taught me about the constant calculation that goes on in the mind of a pilot in relation to speeds and heights and angles, noting that it’s perfectly possible to reach the top of a low-level loop and suddenly apprehend that an unfortunate miscalculation moments ago makes it a mathematical certainty that you will be hitting the runway in 4.3 seconds, at a speed of 358 nautical miles per hour. In fact, one of the Red Arrows had done this just the previous year.” Similar happened a couple of summers ago above Bournemouth (England). I shared Smith’s sadness of the prospect that men of John Young’s (LMP, Apollo 12) calibre will pg.220: now certainly fall foul of the present-day obsession of a society that believes in thinking ever more homogenously, where commercialisation and brand identity are all that matter. Smith is genuinely angry that Young, a man exceptionally short on the unappealing qualities of vanity and narcissism, would never be selected today. I chortled at pgs.247-249: the ‘toilet’ humour and physical challenges of urinating and poo-ing on Apollo are so charmingly and eloquently described. Funny, of course, to the reader; but of VERY real concern to the astronaut and his companions, in what was physically an extremely restricted space. Michael Collins’ description of those same procedures in his book, “Carrying The Fire” should likewise not be missed. Back to “Moondust”, and pg 86: entertained me as to how Michael Collins once speculated on the unmentioned question of travel expenses (The NASA rate of 8c per mile would have yielded a very useful $80,000). He understandably lets it drop when he discovers that another person had already tested this; only to be presented with a bill of $185 million for one launch-ready Saturn V rocket!Smith largely downplays what must have been his most significant challenge; that of persuading as many as possible of the surviving Moonwalkers to open up and grant him one, or in some cases more than one, interview. He won through by respecting their personal schedules, and politely working around them. The best thing about these interviews is how Smith keeps his reader fully, or what feels like pretty comprehensively, informed on what he’s thinking as each encounter takes place, and each interview progresses. Suddenly I became aware that here was a remarkably astute interviewer; one who is gracious enough to seek the best from his subject, but at the same time not to betray the relationship of trust, let alone to betray. He clearly relates well to his subjects; even the notoriously self-contained & publicity shy Neil Armstrong eventually warms and unwinds a little. I thought Smith pin-sharp in his analysis that: p.156:  “Old fashioned fame was acquired, but celebrity is bestowed: it only exists in relationship with the audience-jury we supply and comprise.” and his sighting of how pg.184: Alan Bean’s conscience knew that it would be all too easy to change actual memories from life into memories that he wished he had. Pg.169: explores how that ‘magic’ never left the lunar astronauts is made manifest when watching Al Reinart’s Oscar-winning film For All Mankind. I’ve seen that film. It is jaw-droppingly amazing & pin-sharp. The pressure must have been, and continue to be (for those alive still) considerable. On pg.305: Gene Cernan (LMP, Apollo 17) bewails: “But we didn’t put ourselves in front of the public, which is what celebrities tend to do. We just got thrust there.” I really felt for him (I have never been a fan of celebrity). It is Smith who endeavours to unravel the puzzle: pg.289:  “… our fascination is not about them; it’s about us.” Smith concludes that there is a significant difference between the Apollo Commanders, who were tasked with piloting the lunar modules: Armstrong, Conrad, Shepard, Scott, Young, and Cernan; and their crews. On pg.332 he rationalises Deke Slayton’s choice of Apollo LMPs as picked: “ … for their rarefied focus and tightly reined imaginations, for their relative immunity to doubt, ambivalence, and vacillation …” In one word, ‘impregnability’. I wonder how many employers today select their staff by applying quite such a thorough analytical methodology?4.5 stars. I finished this book really enjoying it. But Michael Collins’ “Carrying The Fire” beats it."

An incredibly engaging, introspective, amusing, curious dive into the Apollo story and the stories of those who lived it."
15,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline,5,"This is an interesting book: part travelogue, part collective biography of the nine remaining men who set foot on the moon and what happened to them after that life-changing experience, and part philosophical discourse on what Apollo and the moon landings have come to mean to us in the forty years since Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon. I loved it, from start to finish; I couldn't put it down, and when I did I felt thoroughly infected by the author's passion and 'childlike wonder'.It's that wonder, I think, that keeps us fixating on the moon, on the Apollo space program, and on the men who risked their lives to reach the moon. Because when you look at the numbers, at the billions of dollars that the program cost, all the men and the manpower and the resources, and what did we achieve? A man stood on another world, but in concrete terms, what has it meant? And the answer is, truthfully, very little. Could that money and brainpower have been better spent solving problems here on Earth? Probably. Was Apollo worth it, in those terms?No, probably not, but that's not why we went. Or perhaps it was, perhaps it was meant to be about technological advances and great leaps forward, and in that sense perhaps Apollo was a failure and that's why we haven't been back since. But it's not why we should go back. Going to the moon, Smith argues, isn't about the moon, it's about us. It's about giving us the perspective to see our own world in its proper context, an opportunity to see how precious and small it is and we all are. Going to the moon doesn't only help us to learn about another world, it helps us to learn about this world and our place in it. To quote Mallory, we should go because it's there. We should go because it's next, because we as humans have always been about moving on, moving up, crossing rivers and climbing mountains and overcoming the next challenge and the next and the next...It's incredible to me that my mobile phone has more technology in it than the program that put a man on the moon, and you can't help but think, Why did we stop? Why didn't we push on? Why has it all stagnated? If we could put a man on the moon forty years ago why aren't we further along? Where has that desire gone? If everyone could read this book, perhaps that spark might be rekindled, because one day Apollo might prove to be the beginning of a journey that will save our lives, and who would be counting the cost then?"
16,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17463213-j-m-hushour,4,"Not so much a history of the Apollo guys, more an expedition for their own self-searching about what they did, as told through the author's own self-searching.Of course, it's with the latter that one can easily find fault, because, frankly, who cares what Smith thinks. This is about finding out what the remaining (then) nine guys who walked on the moon thought about the experience. I'll get back to Smith in a minute.Smith's attempts to wander around America getting the nine living Apollo astronauts views on what it meant for them to go and be on the moon is often hilarious, sometimes depressing, but always eye-opening even when, and maybe especially when, they are understandably reluctant to talk about it. Armstrong is one one end of the spectrum, tight-lipped, notoriously evasive and invisible, avoiding pretty much everyone (he's the nice twist at the end, though, when Smith comes full circle). Others, like Aldrin or Mitchell or Schmitt or Bean (the painter) are frank and unreserved. (Pete Conrad, whose death inspired this book, is sadly absent from the book. He was the best one.)Others, like Young and Cernan, are evasive and vague, shopfronts to an enterprise whose achievement is stark but whose meaning still isn't. It's the latter that Smith is searching for and that's why his book is so rewarding. But it could easily be misconstrued as self-aggrandizing or even self-absorbed, because this is as much about him exploring what Apollo meant growing up the late 60s and early 70s as it is about what the astronauts felt."
17,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18922967-nic-margett,5,"While at work reading this on my lunch break, one of my colleagues mocked the ""Richard and Judy's book club"" logo on the front page. I was very quick to defend them. I've only read a handful from their lists, but every single one has been a thoroughly entertaining and effortless read and this one has been no different. I read a lot of science fiction, yet it occurred to me while i read this that i hadn't really looked at the realities of space exploration in any particular depth. I've watched a couple of documentaries before, but this book really got to the feelings of the men who went up there. Smith's writing is friendly and informative and full of the wonders he felt as a child. I particularly enjoyed how he mentions things like music, and his general experiences on the road to meet the astronauts. He talks about all sorts of things that i hadn't even considered, and i can say now unequivocally that i have a different view of space than the one i had before."
18,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14012853-erin-greenberg,5,"I can't tell you how much I loved this book. I read it a few years ago during a summer of space race reading. I ended up buying my own copy and have loaned it to several friends already! It was amazing to read the impact space travel and moonwalks had on these elite men. Their lives were never the same. The most interesting aspect of this book was watching each astronaut's story unfold. Each of them did the same thing (aside from Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swiggert of Apollo 13) - they each travelled in space and landed on the moon. But each experienced the same phenomenon differently: Alan Bean became a painter; Jack Swiggert was elected to Congress; Neil Armstrong caved from the social pressures and immediate fame. To see their post-lunar careers evolve, as well as their personal and spiritual lives, was incredible. These men and their missions will always hold a special place in my heart. I can't help but look up at the moon and be inspired by what they did. "
19,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,5,"In turns poignant, humorous and contemplative, this is a beautifully written book that goes far beyond simply interviewing the surviving American astronauts who walked on the moon. Considering the trajectory of their lives following their lunar expeditions raises many questions about what brings true satisfaction. I'm actually not very interested in astronomy or space exploration, but the quality of the storytelling kept me engaged throughout, which is a real credit to the author. Excellent audio production."
20,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10074410-mark-fleming,5,"A masterpiece. A book that manages to convey the awe, the magic and yet the very ordinariness of an extraordinary time and event. We can almost walk with these ageing men in an impossible place. We feel their aches of age and the sadness they each seem to convey. The moon-men soared in their early lives, test pilots, fighter pilots and daredevils. Then they set off for the moon. Each in their own way has never returned, and for those who reached its ancient surface, something other than just their footprints remain.If you read just one book on those extraordinary times, make it this one."

The purpose of the book sounded fascinating (man goes to moon, returns, life is ruined forever) but in reality this pitch was stretched wafer thin. The book felt like it ought to have been an interesting long article, but instead you have loads of navel gazing filler from the author - ""weren't the sixties just great let me tell you all about it..."" um, no ta."
22,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48062775-james-ferrara,2,"A passable book - fairly disorganized, this book purports to be about the men who walked on the Moon but is as much about the author and his journey as any of the astronauts. It was an enjoyable, albeit lengthy, read, probably about 20% longer than necessary and disappointing in terms of storytelling. "
23,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242652-phillip-jones,3,"This was a random purchase but turned out to be very good indeed. The conceit is that the writer is trying to find the remaining men who walked on the moon and, while doing so, tries to find-out why the world has become so unimpressed by their achievement. Intriguing."

Delightful, thoughtful."
25,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15167899-hilary-g,2,"EX-BOOKWORM GROUP REVIEWI am very sorry but I finally had to give up on this book, which completely failed to hold my attention. After trying to read it for more than a month, I am barely past page 100 and mired in the incoherent ramblings of Buzz Aldrin. How disappointing that humanity’s first ambassadors into space, had they met any aliens, were barely articulate enough to say “Take me to your leader”.I have always been terrifically interested in the space programme. The year after the first landing on the moon, I queued up in Sheffield to see a piece of moonrock and although it was just a small grey lump, I was in awe of where it had come from and the effort it had taken to bring it where I could gaze at it. Critics of the programme bemoan the amount of money that was spent on it, but not me. I’m sure there were similar people bemoaning the cost of expeditions to America or Australia at the time when they were as far away in the imagination as the moon was before we went there, but we as a race could not continue wondering what was beyond what we could see. Curiosity is a characteristic of our species and we will always need to reach out and explore the unknown, find the answers to questions, learn.There was a bit in the book about a Star Trek convention and about how fans queued up to get autographs from actors pretending to be space travellers, while the real space traveller sat on his own at another table. The point was that the fakes are more interesting than the real heroes. I thought this was very poignant, but very true. These men who landed on the moon were more flawed than fascinating. How human was the pecking order, the political manoeuvrings and the petty criticisms of each other?The writing was very competent and workmanlike. Though I know nothing about him, I suspect Andrew Smith is one of those writers, like Hunter Davies, who can write a book about anything. Ask for a book about the mating habits of the grasshopper and these writers will try to convince you they have been fascinated by the subject since early infancy. But I wasn’t convinced. I never believed that Andrew Smith has spaceships on his pyjamas. The book, well written as it was, lacked any real passion for its subject, to such an extent that the bits that had nothing to do with space travel, that were put in just as literary scenery, were marginally the most interesting bits. An example of this was Smith’s parents coming to New York from Acton Town (and how convincing is that? – Acton Town is merely a tube station and I can’t imagine anyone saying they came from there).I try really hard not to give up on books, but life is too short and there are too many books to read.The one image that will remain with me from this book was the fact that, for a short period, the commander of the lunar module was cut off from the rest of humanity, separated from any other member of his species by the moon. I tried to imagine this solitude, played to a soundtrack of Dark Side of the Moon, but I suspect our lonely hero didn’t even think about it and was too busy recording temperatures or pushing buttons and knobs.I prefer the space travel of my imagination rather than this dreary reality!"
26,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742074-megan,5,"I found this book to be fascinating, uplifting, inspiring, and emotionally moving. It was well-written, and here and there quite humorous. I feel grateful in a surprising way after reading this, grateful and happy that someone attempted to interview these men, and that Andrew Smith got as close as he did to finding out the astronauts real thoughts on what it was like to be on the moon, and what it was like to come home after and live on the Earth. Smith has a gift for staying grounded in reality while letting his mind travel into the wondrous; he manages to capture all that was fantastic and inspiring about the Apollo program and the men who participated in it through describing his own memories and experiences growing up in America during the 60's and early 70's, but he never loses sight of the truth he is seeking or turns to simply repeating facts, lauding the entire endeavor, or gushing. I really enjoyed his personal musings on the Apollo program and the socio-political climate of America during that time, as well as his own ""looking back on it all now"" reflections. But the interviews with the astronauts are truly fantastic. He really probes their characters and their consciousnesses in search of the answers to his questions. And his questions may seem base on the surface perhaps, but I really feel like this book does a better job than anything else I've encountered of trying to capture ""What was it like to be on the moon?"" I find myself feeling... elated, and lucky that someone thought to explore this, and to search out these men, before it was too late. This book is a great read for anyone already interested in space exploration or the Apollo missions, obviously, but I really feel like anyone interested in humanity can enjoy this book and should pick it up. As Smith surmises at the end, ""Was Apollo worth all the effort and expense? If it had been about the Moon, the answer would be no, but it wasn't, it was about the Earth,"" and ""Through Apollo, the Moon did what it has always done: it shone fresh light on what was already there."" Similar to the way in which going to the moon awakened and gave new perspective to humanity, Smith has definitely thrown fresh light onto the history of Apollo with this book, as well as on the culture that produced Apollo and the culture we're in today. "
27,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186293-darkpool,5,"This may not have been the best book to ""read"" (or rather listen to) at the start of my Apollo kick, coming as it does from the far more philosophical perspective of ""What did it all mean?"" rather than the prosaic ""What happened?"". I found myself, as the author reflected on the fact that he was about the same age as the astronauts he was interviewing were when they walked on the moon, realising that I myself am about the age he was when he was chasing these men down to interview them for this book. Does this mean something? Probably not. But Moondust makes us look for patterns and connections in the oddest of places.Perhaps it would have been better if I had become more accustomed to the astronauts as they were at the time of the moon landings before meeting them as old men, as we do in this book. I have however sharpened my focus on what else I want to read most, and whose autobiographies I might skip altogether. I found that I had already formed some opinions of these men through watching documentaries line ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" and ""When We Left Earth"", some of which were overturned by this book, but some which were reinforced. I very much enjoyed this book, and have had to fight off the urge to immediately go off and procure a print copy to thumb through and dip into. I felt privileged to accompany the author on his hunt for the moonwalkers, and to feel the passion/obsession he was possessed with. At times I found myself hooting with laughter, at others looking around for which of my family and friends I could share the latest bit of Apollo trivia with. I'm only sorry he didn't give us a bit more of the ones who didn't walk on the moon; the CM pilots, like Al Worden who wrote poetry while he orbited the moon, and those members of the crews of Apollos 8, 10 and 13, who did the trip but never landed. I know this is beyond the scope of Andrew Smith's intention - to find the remaining 9 moonwalkers - but I would have dearly loved to hear directly from Mike Collins, rather than just having his 30 year old memoirs quoted extensively. That aside, I just adored this book, with its curious mix of the past and present, and want to make everyone I know read it, if only to tell me I'm not mad for loving it so much."
28,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,0,"http://nhw.livejournal.com/647774.html[return][return]Moondust is superb. Smith tells the story of his efforts to track down the nine living men who have walked on the moon, presenting it as a chronological narrative, one by one, with contributory material from other interested parties (Reg Turnhill, Richard Gordon, Bill the dentist in Carson City, Charles Duke's wife Dotty, etc). But he integrates also reflections on how it seemed at the time, what was going on in politics, how the Apollo program affected and was affected by the popular culture of the day.[return][return]He gets much more from the five surviving LM pilots than from the four surviving commanders. Alan Bean in particular comes across as the kind of guy you would like to know. Buzz Aldrin, given a chance to tell his side of the story, seems much more human than in Hansen's biography of Armstrong. Armstrong himself proves elusive - two conversations at conferences, followed by a series of email exchanges. The most elusive of all is the disgraced David Scott, in hiding not so much because of the decades old ""stamps affair"" but because of his fling with British newsreader Anna Ford (which I had completely forgotten about).[return][return]I guess I found the book particularly appealing because Smith reflects several times that he is about the same age as the astronauts were when they carried out the moon landings. He is four years older than me, and wrote most of the book three to four years ago, so I felt a particular connection with him, and with them, while reading it. But I think it is written well enough to appeal even to people who are not approaching or just past their fortieth birthdays.[return][return]It would have been nice to have had some photographs, but Smith's visual descriptions are so evocative that perhaps it's not necessary, and anyway there is no shortage of pictures of the relevant individuals on the Web. An excellent book."

So he decides to interview as many of them as he can and then write a book about his experiences of the interviews.Yes - you got it - this isn't a book about the men who walked on the moon - this is a book about the author's experiences of his conversations with them.Of course, in the course of writing about himself he also includes some material about the moon-walkers, but most of it is about how he felt about this little band of astronauts and the things they did.I felt kind of let down.The next thing I'm going to do is watch the movie 'Apollo 13' - hopefully that'll give me a better idea of how it feels to escape the bounds of Earth and rocket away into the unknown.Just think though - no-one knew what would happen when they walked on the moon. There could have been space monsters or bad radiation or the whole thing could have been made of cream-cheese and they could have sunk out of sight. Just imagine drowning in a sea of cream-cheese!Yuck!As it was, the worst that happened was that it was difficult dealing with the everyday problems of peeing, pooing and breaking wind. Did you know that they peed directly into space? Imagine that - nothing between your todger and the void. Yeah - it makes me shudder to think about it too!Not a quick read.Not an easy read.Not recommended for you if you just want to know what it felt like to walk on the moon.That's all."

My fascination about the bravery of the men who travelled to the Moon was satisfied by the author’s quest to meet with the nine surviving Moon walkers. Questions that provoke much thought are posed throughout the book such as why is the quest to the Moon so engaging? - What was similar and different about the small band of travellers that escaped the grip of the Earth’s gravitational field to look back upon the Earth? - and what affect did it have on the rest of their lives? This is a rolling, evolving book that does not follow straight lines and is all the better for it – the author manages to blend in some personal and autobiographical musings and details that do not intrude on the main theme of the book; this is quite an achievement and at first I did not think he would be able to manage it successfully – but he did.Some fascinating encounters litter the book, particularly with the very different characters that are Buzz Aldrin, Al Bean and John Young. The fact that the author managed to make meaningful contact with Neil Armstrong is a tribute to his determination and the book as a whole has a elegiac feel to it, honouring a time that was brave and at the forefront of human endeavour but which we seem to have lost somehow.

Excellent value!My full review can be found at http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84...The preface to this 2009 book contains Smith's observation that, perfectly in character, Neil Armstrong did not attend his hometown's celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing. In his afterword, Smith observes the mellowing of the survivors of that select band of Moonwalkers.To my mind, the most interesting addition to this book is found on the back of the second page in: a 3 x 4 array of equal sized black & white photographs of each of the twelve men who walked on the surface of Earth’s Moon. All but Buzz Aldrin are pictured in their space-going youth. Alas, there are no photographs of those men and women, from the lowliest cleaner at NASA to the Mercury and Gemini crews, to the Apollo Command Module Pilots. But there again “Moondust” is not an exploration of the Apollo project. Perhaps I am looking for a nest of websites to be written; describing every single person whose work contributed to the process and success of the US Moon landings?"
32,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162759-margaret,4,"In 1999, journalist Smith met Charlie and Dotty Duke, in order to interview them for a magazine article. Duke was one of the twelve Americans who walked on the moon (as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 16), and during the interview, they got the news that Pete Conrad, an Apollo 12 moonwalker, had died in a motorcycle accident. Duke's sad response was, ""Now there's only nine of us,"" and therewith started Smith's personal quest to speak to all of the remaining moonwalkers. The result is a marvelous melange of space exploration history, astronaut reminiscences, and Smith's own recollections of growing up during the moon race era. Along with Andrew Chaikin's A Man on the Moon (a straight history) and Michael Collins's Carrying the Fire (the best astronaut memoir, by the Apollo 11 command module pilot), Moondust is one of the best books I've read on the Apollo program. "
33,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9946326-paulfozz,4,"In some ways I feel I may need to re-read this book in order to gain a better perspective on it, having read it during a period where I struggled to keep focus on reading while other things have been happening in my life. For all that though I found this a very interesting read, an exploration of Apollo and the remaining men who once trod the lunar soil; a search for understanding of the ways their lives were affected by their experiences. It tells a side of the Apollo story that I hadn't seen much of, other than knowing that Neil Armstrong had been very reclusive. I sometimes found that for my taste the book was a little more 'journalistic' than my personal taste and felt it dragged out a little bit longer than I would have liked; however those are only minor points and could just be due to my current distracted state of mind! It remains a very good book and not one that should be restricted to 'space nut' readers, if you'll excuse the term."
34,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16392371-carol-hislop,5,I don't know why I like this book so much because I am definitely not a scientifically minded person but I really loved it. It is written by a journalist who meets all of the nine astronauts who have walked on the moon. He writes about why they became astronauts and what effects their trips to the moon had on them. It's maybe of more interest if you lived at the time of the moon landings though as I did.
35,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903520-alison-smith,4,"Andrew Smith tracks down the last 9 astronauts who went to the moon - 30 years after the event. A fascinating book about the American Space Progress/the Cold War/the 60s & 70s. I was astounded at the danger & risks which the astronauts faced. Smith brilliantly recreates the excitement, the atmosphere of the times. Half the men who went were radically changed, half were not. A really interesting (& entertaining) read. Highly recommended. "
36,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13416328-kyrstie-gennoe,5,"I have a fascination with the moon, space and space travel. I therefore loved this book. It takes us back to a time and an excitement we will never haw again and brings the sense of 'what if' that is not possible today. It focuses on the people and emotions and the day to day work of getting to the moon. I can't wait to read it again"
37,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771227-everett-darling,5,"Totally invigorating and inspiring. Able to renew the space fascination which has dwindled since the Apollo missions, and in general, will touch the reader's own sense of child-like wonder. Never before have I considered the space program in such a meaningful way. Now, I am a believer."
38,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,3,It had an interesting point of view as you see what became of the astronauts who walked on the Moon without technicalities of the missions themselves and also you get some more context for when the missions happened. 
39,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1900466-velimir-randic,4,"A great insight about what happened to the Apollo astronauts after they left the Moon, how they coped with the experience and how it changed all of them."

41,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7870623-afreen-aftab,4,"“When I review my travels among the astronauts, my mind's eye goes first to the Houston shopping mall where Alan Bean sat for hours after returning from space, just eating ice cream and watching the people swirl around him, enraptured by the simple yet miraculous fact that they were there and alive in that moment, and so was he.”I love this kind of immersive journalism where the focus isn't just on pure statistics and recounting of events…but on the feelings and personalities involved.I remember watching Apollo 13 and never realizing what the inside joke the astronauts were making about Guenter Wendt was and never bothered looking it up (call me lazy) until I read this book. Or the fact that Ed Mitchell had contributed to the Quantum Holography theory when just months ago I watched a Kurgezast video on the very same thing. It's the little things like that that kept me hooked. Just how complex and these moonwalkers were and just how little we know about them, especially the current generation, despite their arguably monumental contribution to the history of humankind and that besides being hailed as heroes they were also very very human.And not to mention the various anecdotes and stories about people involved in the missions, the resilient wives of the moonwalkers, the spectators, the celebrity, the scandals, the inspiration, the conspiracy theorists, and the importance and decadence of the missions themselves were truly enlightening."
42,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334584-peter-pinkney,4,"Ah the Moon, beloved of poets, artists, scientists and me!I can remember watching the first moon landing live on a black and white television, just as if watched the previous Apollo missions, and listening to (among others) the wonderful James Burke describing exactly what was going on. To my 13 year old self, this was SF made real.Andrew Smith, an Englishman born in USA, wonders just why they did it, and what had happened to the nine astronauts, who were still alive when the book was written,since. Had it changed their lives? Did they have regrets?Each of the astronauts has a fascinating story-My favourites being Al Bean, Buzz Aldrin, and the wonderful Ed Mitchell. The real question was why America went to the Moon, and why they haven’t been since. Was it Kennedy’s ego (massive at the best of times), The Cold War, or for science and progression? We are given many answers.And then there are the deniers, and conspiracy theorists...good Grief, where do these people come from....A great read, even if some of the technical stuff is difficult "
43,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,3,"Certainly an unusual examination of Apollo, its moonwalkers and their lives post NASA, as well as a wider commentary on the political, scientific and sociological reverberations since America decided 'to set sail on this new sea'.Andrew Smith, born in New York, has lived in England since his teens and lived in California at the time of the lunar expeditions, is an interesting hybrid to analyse the Apollo programme and the astronauts involved. In fact, Smith becomes just as interesting as the subjects that he tracks down as the book progresses.'Moondust' was published back in 2005 when nine moonwalkers remained of the original twelve. At the time of reading this, we have since lost Armstrong (Apollo 11), Mitchell (Apollo 14) and Cernan (Apollo 17). So a case can be made for the increasing value of Smith's biographies."
44,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43625824-patrick-murtha,5,"It has become all too common for non-fiction narratives to be written in the form of the author's ""quest for the story"" (and, coincidentally, for him/herself). Probably the whole format ought to be banished for anything but extremely occasional use; but I have to admit that Andrew Smith's Moondust offers an instance where it really works, because some of the surviving moonwalkers were quite hard for Smith to snare, and their elusiveness is actually central rather than incidental. (Where have you gone, Neil Armstrong?) The quest for the story here is fascinating, step by step, and the material that comes out of it is enthralling. A book justifies its structure by delivering the goods, and Moondust does just that. "
45,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2304684-david,5,"Hypnotic. Extraordinary. Brilliant. A combination of biography and autobiography, reflection and introspection, history and legend. It shouldn't work. It nearly doesn't work, as Smith's tangents at times threaten to hurtle this book into outer space, but it really does work. It's fascinating hearing the details of the Apollo missions, the impact on the men involved, and their reflections on this brief other-wordly experience from 30 years before. Although totally different in style and subject matter, the merging of Smith's life with the subject of his book reminded me of another great book, ""HHhH"" by Laurent Binet. The personal journey of the author in both adds an extra dimension that enhanced the reading experience for me."
46,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100704184-chris-rands,4,"The author's almost spiritual (although not religious) quest to speak with all the 9 (then) remaining living people who stepped on the moon is certainly fascinating and though provoking. There are few technical details here, instead it's all about how the moon landings and space make us feel. The book also asks some interesting questions about the risks NASA took, and the relative lack of recent progress in space exploration (e.g. no human in 'deep space' since 1972). It is reflective and not un-critical at times. The author feels the need to give frequent historical backdrops, which can leave the reader a little dazed, but he manages to pull things back quickly. Moon Dust is a book for dreamers, thinking about our place in the universe. "
47,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24116616-mark-apel,5,"I have been fascinated by space flight and the Apollo Missions since I was a kid. While reading this book I realize my view on Apollo was one of perfection, pride, and the flexing of America’s bicep. Smith’s book shows the Apollo era for what it was...confusing, ambitious, and possibly pointless. (or potentially a model for how we should approach all endeavors in life. I like this point he lands on in the end.) His humor and down to earth (no pun intended) interviewing skills makes this a great read for anyone interested in manned space flight and the moon landings. I don’t read a lot of non-fiction, but this is one to spend some time with."

49,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2839087-greenockian,5,"Such a well-written book. When a writer follows his heart, as in this case, something truly insightful and honest emerges. We get to see the men who walked on the moon as the real individuals they were/are rather than the Marvel superheroes depicted by the media and NASA. What we learn is one of life's simple truths: ""It's good to dream but even heroes can be funny buggers too: just like the rest of us!"" I am so glad I read this and even now, several weeks after reading it, I can feel its impact on me."

51,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163809-edward,3,"A writer explores what walking on the moon meant to the astronauts, himself, and society at large. One quote from moonwalker-turned painter Alan Bean about seeing Earth from space stands out: "" we've been looking out of telescopes for three hundred years; we've been sending probes into space, and we have never seen anything as beautiful as what we see when we walk out the front door. That's why, when I came back from the spaceflight, I was a different person."" "

In the end, I got into the rhythm and definitely enjoyed his musings on all of the above. Certainly different from other books on our space program. "
53,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23515305-eileen-breseman,5,"Both the book and the idea of chasing down the often shy Moon Men for interviews, was brilliant! And also very timely - written in 2005 while there were 9 living of the 12 that left Earth's orbit, their story was very unique. This copy came with an afterward written in 2018, after most had died in their 80s, NASA has new life and private competition. The author, close in age to myself, connects their stories to what was going on in his life and on the world stage to which I could relate. His coverage included the wives and children, their childhood stories, some about their fathers and upbringing that inspired them to become engineers, soldiers, pilots, then space astronauts in a budding new field in a space race that was National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He follows the program from Project Mercury, Gemini, Apollo to Space Shuttle and the International Space Station, but mainly focuses on each of their personal stories. The main questions explored included ""what did it feel to walk on the moon, look back at earth, what were your main takeaways"", and ""what's next in your life after you've been to the moon and back?"" For all, it was a hard reentry into life back home, from unwanted fame to disconnection to family after months away. Those that have looked at our tiny, fragile Earth from a perspective of deep space were all changed profoundly from the experience; and by doing so, we were also. The author's writing style was wonderful! I highly recommend this book."
54,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7652301-john-p-davis,5,"Andrew Smith brings to life the most extraordinary accomplishment possible for any human, walking on the moon. I absolutely loved this book and Smith's honest take on his interviews with the Moon Walkers. He was very transparent and let the Moon Walker's stories and personas carry a magnificent book. I recommend this to anyone. Their perspectives are given so much respect from Smith and he succeeded in writing such an amazing book."
55,0747563691,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4148474-daniel-wood,4,"This is excellent. Not only are the conversations with the Apollo astronauts (and some family, technical staff and even Apollo nuts), really interesting, but it's relayed with a passion and personality that makes it even more enjoyable. Almost a coming-of-age tale too, or a re-coming-of-age, or something like that. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone interested in Apollo, the space age, even people who just enjoy a good read."
