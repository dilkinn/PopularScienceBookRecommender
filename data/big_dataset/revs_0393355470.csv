I wanted to hug her in the end. This book is full of little anecdotes that bring the information alive in one`s mind. Her curiosity is contagious. Physics for everyday life is a book that will put the sparkle in your eye, if you are one of those people who look around, observe and love to know Why. It will make a great gift to the scientifically inclined teen or adult."

In this book, author Helen Czerski attempts to show us how physics affects everyday life. Each chapter begins with something everyday – something small; such as trying to get ketchup from a bottle or stirring a cup of tea. From these innocuous springboards, she uses these examples to investigate much greater events in science and technology, using these seemingly simple beginnings. Even the chapter titles in this book are delightful. You have such titles as, “What goes up must come down,” “Why don’t ducks get cold feet?” and “Spoons, Spirals and Sputnik.” Who can resist? Being a child of the Seventies, when science was not a compulsory subject, my scientific knowledge is less than zero, but I found myself enthused by this book. She does not dumb down her writing, but simply makes it accessible, understandable and entirely riveting. I can honestly say that you will not see everyday things in the same light again if you read this book and so, if you have any interest in how the world works and the strange, amazing patterns within it, give this a try."
2,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5894689,5,"Despite the complexity of physics, this book will make you understand it and love it. You observe simple stuff in your daily routine, and never thought about how they work, right? Well this book will make you look at life in a different way. Physics is for everyone. I kept saying ""wow"" throughout the book. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen-r,4,"Author and PhD Helen Czerski loves physics and wants others to share her enthusiasm. She sure won me over. This is a thoughtful debut by Czerski, a physicist/oceanographer. Chock full of tidbits on how/why stuff works, she breaks down things that I never even thought about and makes science easily understood. Curiosity is human nature and I find myself more curious of everyday experiences and thinking about things in new ways after reading Helen’s book. Is it worth paying more for a fluorescent light? Should my sunglasses have polarizing lenses? How can I tell a raw egg from a boiled egg without taking off their shells? Why isn’t my ketchup coming out of the bottle? Why does my tea water slosh around when I carry my mug to the other end of the room? Why don’t ducks get cold feet? Well, I never put much thought in about these things nor their physics but now I can amaze my friends with newfound knowledge! I could go on and on about the stuff I learned from Helen, but just do yourself a favor and go buy the book."
4,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"This book is an anomaly, it deals with very technical and complex stuff but tries to take the simple approach to explain said phenomena. Physics will always be a complex subject and even though it affects everything inside and around us , there are few people who can name what this subject is about , let alone try to explain it to other people. This book tries to fill that gap and explain complex physics fundamentals to the masses (us), it succeeds in a way , as some parts of this book were really fun and you forgot you were actually studying physics, but by taking the simple route you also lose the ability to explain the more complex stuff of physics which it is what makes that subject so important. A delicate balance had been reached by this book, very short of achieving its true goal but coming in very close to it ."
5,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"This is physics without the equations, far more immediate and dramatic than the way we usually encounter it in courses. Czerski provides a great deal of good, basic knowledge--how physics is a part of everything we experience and do. Her examples are easy to understand and refreshing.The end of the book, about electromagnetism, gets a bit denser. And the conclusion has a ""history-of-the-world"" overreach aspect. But, these are minor, minor points in an innovative, thoughtful and considerate-to-readers explication of this basic science. One comes away saying ""why can't anyone else teach physics so clearly?"" The answer is, it takes a remarkable talent to first understand the science (with all of its equations), then doubly so to explain it with such immediate, everyday examples.The biology corollary to this book is the beautifully-written, unfortunately-named Lab Girl, by Hope Jahren."
6,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,4,"Storm in a Teacup lives up to its name - the book takes basic, every day phenomena and explains the physics behind the phenomena in an easy and approachable fashion. The stand out feature for me was the clarity of explanations aimed at the common person without getting into too much detail while still retaining the core of the physics. There are multiple topics covered in the book and within each topic, there are various examples considered. This book focuses mainly on newtonian physics which is a good bet since that is more in line with our common sense.Overall, I will highly recommend this book for people who want to get a basic understanding of physics in the real world without getting into equations or quantum mechanics. Advanced readers will not get much of this book though."
7,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"Helen Czerski, physicist at University College London's Department of Mechanical Engineering, explains what the physics is behind everyday stuff, like what makes a toaster toast bread or what forces are at work when we stir milk into a serving of tea. Amazing. I had no idea electromagnetic forces were in the bottom of my toaster, for example. I had no idea of why ducks' feet do not freeze. I had no idea of how the sound of thunder worked (that rumble after the initial crash). She talks about the soda bubbles and centrifugal forces and gravity and electrons and photons and soundwaves which underlie our activities in kitchens and gardens and oceans. I never thought about snail slime, but now I know more about the physics of slime. I knew atoms vibrate, but now I understand more vividly how fast or slow that that vibrating is occurring determines so much more about what form an element takes - solid, liquid, gas, and how it makes stuff, like water, glass, clothes drying out, function.'Storm in a Teacup' is an excellent general science book of everyday physics, well written and extremely fun to read! Highly recommend. Simple explanations, but not at all juvenile or patronizing. Subjects are vaguely linked, but the author really seems to more or less follow a train of thought than rigidly organize her subjects.Really interesting book.

8,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22117564-douglas-lord,1,"Damn this book is disappointing because it sounds like it could be so good. It’s scattered, not centered, and feels disorganized. Czerski’s ’splainings aren’t so clear, skipping from point A to point B then to point Z in leaps and bounds. For example, she discusses the strength of air pressure through writing about Otto von Guericke’s vacuum pump demonstration for the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III in 1654. This segues into a discussion of the first attempts at mail by rocket, then space rockets generally, which she tries to sum up as “just molecules bumping into things.” The rest of the explanations are similarly reductive, chopped up, even discrete. VERDICT Isaac Asimov could teach through his writings (see Of Time, Space, and Other Things), and authors such as Mary Roach, whose personal approaches take the form of narratives, can be followed and learned from. Not so much with this book.Find reviews of books for men at Books for Dudes, Books for Dudes, the online reader's advisory column for men from Library Journal. Copyright Library Journal."
9,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"For some people, science can baffle them, they see it as confusing and the domain of experts and specialists. In some cases, they are right; there are some hideously complicated theories out there that are seeking to explain the finest detail about quarks, string theory and genetics. But it needn’t be that way, science can explain just how the things that we interact with on a daily basis, work. In this, her first book, Czerski takes some well-known items, like eggs, popcorn, ducks, Wi-Fi, magnetism and of course teacups and describes how they work and how they show the inner workings of the physics laws. As an introduction to physics and science it is a great little book. Czerski has a chatty style of writing as she tell us about the various subjects, whilst unobtrusively slipping the science in under the radar. For me it is a bit too general in scope, I tend to prefer more specific books, but by making science interesting, and more importantly accessible, this book will appeal even to those that rarely venture into the world of science. 3.5 Stars"
10,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Helen Czerski has long been one of my favourite popular science presenters, due largely to the infectious enthusiasm she beings to her work, and this book begins in very much the same tone. The introduction bubbles with her rapid fire passion for knowledge. However, if think you might find this ebullience wearing, don't worry. Czerski reins this in to a more academic tone for the book proper without ever becoming dry and, Instead, holds the reader's attention in a fascinating way. In each of the nine chapters she begins by discussing a particular physical phenomenon that refers to real-world experience and skilfully expands it to broader and yet more interesting connected areas.I found the approach to be engaging and educational. Even in areas where, as a long time reader of popular science, Czerski was covering ground with which I was familiar, I was still engaged by her obvious interest and approach, and by anticipation of the direction that her train of thought might lead us."
11,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"Slightly edited version of my review in Wall Street Journal:​Did you realize that the rumble of thunder associated with a lightning flash is actually a result of the whipcrack sound from the lightning flash taking longer to reach the ear from greater heights up the lightning bolt itself? “These sound waves are travelling at about 1,100 feet every second or 767 mph, which means they’re taking 4.7 seconds to cover a mile,” explain Helen Czerski in her entertaining new book. “What I hear just after the initial crack is the sound from slightly higher up the lightning bolt. It started as the same sound but it took longer to reach me because it had to travel along a sloping, and therefore longer, path. And then as the thunder rumbles on, I’m hearing the sound from higher and higher up that same lightning bolt.”Dr Czerski is a British physicist with wide experience as a science popularizer both in print media and for the BBC. The emphasis here is definitely on “popular”; “Storm in a Teacup” is very much a fun book, pulling together many easily accessible accounts of how physics explains everyday phenomena, from the titular teacup whirlpools to the reason why ducks don’t freeze when swimming in icy water. Most of the stories are self-contained, so the reader can dip into the book anywhere and be pretty sure of pulling out a juicy plum; many are anecdotal, drawing on the author’s experience as a marine researcher, investigating what goes on at the boundary between sea and atmosphere. Czerski is at her best when describing her personal experiences of natural phenomena, whether this is her struggle with scientific equipment on the heaving deck of a research vessel in a storm, or something as familiar to the reader as that flash of lightning. The result is a painless way of learning how the world works, like having a friendly physicist giving you a personal fireside chat.Although individual anecdotes are self-contained, “Storm in a Teacup” is arranged thematically, with eight chapters each jumping of from a particular phenomenon (such as the reason why popcorn pops) and developing a theme based on that everyday event (in this case, how space rockets work) with a final chapter looking at humankind’s place in the universe.I particularly enjoyed the discussion of why coffee stains dry out to produce brown outlines, not because the explanation was a surprise to me, but because of the nod given to the pioneering microscopist Robert Hooke, whose contribution to the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century is so often overlooked. “Hooke,” she says, “hadn’t just shown the way to the world of the very small; he’d thrown open the doors and invited everyone in for a party. [His book] Micrographia inspired some of the most famous microscopists of the following centuries, and also whetted the appetite of fashionable London.” Indeed “Storm in a Teacup” whets the appetite in the same way, and the fact that there is indeed a connection between Hooke’s work and the way a puddle of coffee dries out gives you a hint of the approach used by Czerski.One thing I learned was why ducks paddling in cold water are able to maintain their body heat. The chapter is jokingly titled “Why Don’t Ducks Get Cold Feet?” but what it actually makes clear is that their feet do indeed get cold (very cold), but thanks to some ingenious plumbing arrangements, this does not make the body of the duck cold. As the author herself says, “ducks can happily stand on the ice precisely because their feet are cold. And they don’t care.” This otherwise excellent book did irritate me in a few small ways. A misguided attempt to interpret the English for an American audience ends up falling between two stools when we are told that the British approach to solving a problem is to “find the cookie tin and put the kettle on.” In my experience, a Britisher might have a biscuit tin, and an American might have a cookie jar. No Britisher I know has a cookie tin, but perhaps they do things differently on board ocean research vessels.More seriously, a reference to radio waves spreading out in circle from the sinking Titanic misses the opportunity to point out that they actually spread spherically, which is relevant to the story built up from that remark. I suspect that the author meant “spherical” but wrote “circular” in a fit of absent-mindedness and never corrected it. Finally one of my pet hates is to see a physicist refer to “the Theories of Special and General Relativity.” It is the theories that are special (that is, restricted to the special case of uniform motion) or general (that is, generally applicable to any motion), not the relativity! As these examples show, the book would have benefited from a final polish by an editor with an understanding of physics and the vernacular. But these are minor points which are unlikely to trouble the intended audience. “Storm in a Teacup” would be an ideal gift for any scientifically inquisitive person, including children and adults who retain the sense of wonder of a child. Robert Hooke would have loved it."
12,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323455-jeremy,4,"A pretty strong offering for the popular physics genre. The author does a good job taking everyday events (frequently involving tea, sometimes coffee or milk) as a springboard to show how physical principles and processes play out across a range of scales. The great strength of this book is a welcome focus on phenomena like fluids and surface tension, which are quite fascinating but don't get this thorough a treatment in other books I've read. A drying coffee spill leads to an explanation of how redwoods can carry water all the way to their top, mopping up a splash of milk leads to a discussion of the technology of microfluidics, and so on. Naturally, this also entails a discussion of how changes in scale (in size, time or speed) change the way that the physics plays out at the same time she underlines the similarity in the processes at work. Her writing is clear and detailed and a joy to read.There were some weak places as well. I was particularly underwhelmed by her treatment of magnetism and how batteries work, but in a book that covers so much ground those are minor dull spots in an otherwise excellent piece of popular science writing."

A very informative and at times unique, out-of-the-box perspective of some of the most fundamental principles in classical physics without the essential mathematics."
14,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"It’s so easy to cast an eye over the world that skims over detail and curiosity. Most would admit to just seeing blue skies, oceans, blindly make their cup of tea in the morning and shoving their toast into the toaster, baring no thought to the world around them (me included) however this book has given me a whole new eye when looking over the things I previously didn’t connect the wonders of science to. If you want a book that will revolutionise your thinking and make you think twice about those everyday things you normally don’t think twice about, this is the one.The authors enthusiasm for her field truly shines through the pages and I absolutely love how big and usually intimidating theories and concepts in physics are brought down to a normal human level in the things we see and do in everyday life. It makes it so much easier to connect to a subject that some can find hard to visualise and understand. It truly brings out your inner child curiosity that normally doesn’t continue into adulthood when it comes to things like science and as a scientist myself, it’s all too easy to launch into the hardcore science and skip out all the fun stuff and fundamental thinking. This is a great book to further your understanding and have fun with all sorts of physics concepts. Fantastic book and a recommended read, this is one I’ll definitely re read again as it’s such an effortless and interesting book!"
15,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"This book delivers pretty much everything I like from a general-interest popular science book. Clear explanations of scientific concepts, in this case about physics, and how those ideas connect to impact peoples' lives. I thought the organization of the book was done very well, and liked how Czerski tied disparate threads together. I particularly liked the explanation of how snails use their slime for moving around, and for navigating seemingly impossible routes, all due to the physics of mucus which behaves like a solid or a liquid depending on the forces acting upon it. This book was packed full of fascinating departures into subjects that might not seem at first to have anything to do with physics, but time and again the author demonstrated how an understanding of science enriches the amazing beauty of the world. the final chapter taking perspective from three different levels of viewpoint was an excellent way to close the book."
16,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,3,"Hmmm, how to rate this one...Well, I didn't love it. In fact, I found it hard to get through. But still, I don't think it was that bad of a book. Czerski brings some interesting tidbits and every day knowledge of physics into her book and from her writing it is quite clear that she is passionate about science. She even has a sort of love letter to science in the final chapter. Physics is just a bit convoluted at times and it's tough to visualize some of these concepts without the aid of diagrams or pictures at all. Some information reads fine without it, but other aspects I struggled to completely grasp. Although she avoids dense vocabulary and generally being pedantic on concepts, it doesn't quite hit the mark. It's too bad because the author seems a lovely, dedicated scientist. I just don't think she exactly struck the balance between physicist and pop. science books. It's not bad... just not my favorite. "
17,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"A well-written pop-science book by a young marine physicist.

18,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762558-amanda,4,"Originally posted at Desert Island Book ReviewsHave you ever wondered why coffee spills leave a ring on the table, or why a piece of buttered toast always falls butter-side down? These are just two of the topics physicist Helen Czerski explains in this book, released at the beginning of January.I’ve always liked science, though I’ll readily admit that physics was always my least favorite branch (I’m a chemistry kind of person). That doesn’t mean that everyday phenomena don’t sometimes mystify me. I understand the theories about things like wireless communication and electricity, but it’s just so crazy to think that we’ve managed to harness them and do so much to make them useful. That’s one of the reasons I really appreciated this book.Czerski takes these everyday things and explains the physics of them, applying what is (I think) the least exciting branch of science to learn to simple little things, like bubbles, coffee stains, and cell phone wireless signals. Okay, that last one is not quite so simple. Still, I liked that in each chapter, she was able to tackle a theme (for instance, electromagnetism) and find several real-world applications to demonstrate it. I liked her apparent natural curiosity about the world and her easily replicable experiments (like putting raisins in a bottle of something fizzy or knocking toast off of the table).I think this book helps make physics seem more approachable, something that’s definitely nice when you want to read about it and not get your PhD in it. It’s science and when you read, you’re learning, but there’s nothing dull here. There aren’t loads of calculations and numbers (one of my least favorite parts of physics in high school). A lot of the things in this book would even make good cocktail party conversation starters (with the right crowd, of course).The only part of this book I didn’t like was the last chapter. I know it was meant to tie things together and give us a broader overview of humans and our place in the world, but it kind of bored me. I liked the earlier chapters’ concrete examples and experiments and found that this was missing at the end. I would’ve left that whole chapter out, focusing instead on the real content of the book.Storm in a Teacup is easy to recommend for anyone interested in science or in learning a little more about how and why the world works. I think it’s appropriate for anyone, of any age, though if you do have a physics degree, it might be a little elementary for you. It’s not exactly a quick read, but if you break it down into chapters, it’s enjoyable, educational, and something a little different, especially if your TBR pile looks anything like mine. I gave it four stars.*ARC from W.W. Norton & Company via NetGalley"
19,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"Basically, this book is the author's reflection on the physics of everyday life. The level is very introductory for the layman. It is what it is. I was a physics major in college so I've kind of seen this stuff before but for a nonphysicist, it might be a fun book."

I have read many great books, but since I’ve read Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes more than one year ago, I’ve never found another book that I enjoyed so much… until now! Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life is exactly what the title promises. But more than that, this is one of those books that make you look at things around you in a different way. Whenever I least expect it, I find myself going back to what I’ve read: yesterday, when I went for a walk and saw an airplane flying above in the sky, this morning when I was preparing breakfast and switched my toaster on and looked at the bright red filaments inside, or just a while ago, when I was turning the spoon around in my teacup and the tea started to swirl around and make a “hole” in the middle. I look at all these things, I notice what is happening and I know why it is happening. And that’s such a great feeling!You don’t have to know anything about physics or even like science to thoroughly enjoy this book.

This is a book that anyone can read and comprehend. It may even change your perspective of the physical world.Each chapter begins with a small example: popcorn popping, swirling water in a teacup, coffee rings on your counter top. After explaining the science behind that phenomenon, it broadens out into larger examples, eventually showing the big picture and how one small law affects every aspect of life.This was a fascinating read for me (because I know little about physics!). Each explanation is crystal clear and thorough. It's the perfect book for someone who wants to know ""how things work"" but doesn't have a head for facts and details."
22,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A wonderfully entertaining read which brings the physics that most of us can't understand into the vernacular. Most of all, it concerns itself with simple explanations and clever experiments which the reader can do at home and experience the wonder of physics. The writing style is clear and simple, but it does not stay shy of some good humor, which can make you feel as if you're just having a proper ol' banter with the author. Would totally recommend to any science geeks who come from an angle of not that much knowledge on the subjects touched, but rather suffer from an incurable case of curiosity and wonder. "

But these familiar surroundings are just the place to look if you’re interested in what makes the universe tick.""(source)I've long felt that my understanding of the physics everyday objects around me is poor and this was the perfect book to remedy that. Author Helen Czerski did an amazing job conveying why physics is so exciting to her. Her writing style was as entertaining and conversational as the blurbs promised. She illustrated every concept with her personal experiences, fascinating historical anecdotes, and interesting natural phenomena. I was far more engaged in the concepts than I ever was in a physics class. She made the concepts both engaging and memorable.My one complaint is that each chapter covers a set of clearly related physical principles, but the many illustrations of those principles don't always flow nicely. In some cases, I also felt that I had to infer the topic of the chapter, when I'd rather have been given a more descriptive chapter heading. However, this really is my only complaint about an amazing book. I learned more fun facts than I know what to do with and I couldn't have enjoyed the learning experience any more. I might be getting ahead of myself, but I loved this book enough that I could see it being one of my top nonfiction reads of the year.a Rafflecopter giveawayThis review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Czerski is an excellent science communicator, making physics both easy to understand and even fun. Her love of physics certainly comes through in this book, and you get the sense that she never stops delighting in seeing the fundamental physical principles at play in everyday life. I am a person much more interested in Earth and the problems we face here than I am in looking towards space, and I think it is a bit misguided that so many people think that the physics of the universe is the main place to find awe, inspiration, and profound ideas. This book shows us that, from a simple teacup to the clever technology of the toaster to the key systems that keep us and our planet running, that you don't have to look beyond our planet to find all of these things."

I am so inspired by this author."

It highlights the concept of ""we are all connected"" on a different platform. It beautifully connects the most mundane of things like stirring your cup of tea to how a storm brews.It's relatable because the examples Helen starts with are practical and then she branches out to many different areas of science explaining how things are.The big topics of electromagnetism, gravity, gas laws, waves, atoms, etc. were discussed using the tangible little things we see and experience (and take for granted) everyday.I gave it a 4 because yes, at times it felt as though her narrations jumped erratically-I guess she wanted to cover as much as she could... and scaling down big topics like that was a feat and so still kudos to her. Also, I was still hooked from the 1st page. If only I had this book when I was studying those concepts... It would've made science subjects a whole lot more fun."
32,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,5,"This is an excellent book on physics for the non-scientist. If you already understand physics, you will probably be bored. But for those of us who have been intimidated by physics for most of our lives, this was a welcome introduction. I don't say that I'm now comfortable with physics, just a little less intimidated. Czerski describes the physical processes and rules involved in a number of everyday occurrences, from the mundane -- ice in glass of water -- to the extraordinary -- movement of the techtonic plates. And she explains them in everyday terms so they're mostly easy to comprehend. And she personalizes it with anecdotes from her life. I very much enjoyed this book and recommend it highly."
33,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1916727-laura,3,"This book is one I checked out of the library and now will buy for my son to read. Czerski uses commonplace things like bubbles, ketchup, cotton towels, coffee, etc., to explain physics. She is fascinated by the physics in the ordinary everyday world around us, and her enthusiasm and willingness to explain it all makes this book good. "
34,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14404332-sara-goldenberg,2,"I wasn't super crazy about it. I knew it's written for the lay person but I just don't think she explains things simply or interestingly enough. For example, she explains why ketchup is so hard to get out of the bottle. I read it, it didn't much resonate with me, and since my daughter is a big fan of the stuff, I read it to her. Neither of us were terribly impressed."
35,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20388505-muhamed,5,Amazing book. It is exactly what I wanted which was to learn about the physics behind everyday phenomena. She does an amazing job. The book is so easy to follow and very entertaining. It just made everything around me much more interesting. It's so cool to know why things happen the way they do.

37,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21194234-rachel-dick-plonka,4,I enjoyed it. My husband has a PhD in physics and I now feel like I know more about everyday physics than he does.
38,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"Hooray for scientists like Helen Czerski! Correction—hooray for scientists like Helen Czerski who are also gifted writers, a skill combination that is not a common occurrence. Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life is an excellent book with answers to questions readers may not have articulated, but are now glad that they know. This book will charm you into a respect, and possibly even a love for physics. Ms. Czerski’s enthusiasm bubbles off the pages and tickles the literary senses. The “Everyday Life” part of the book’s subtitle might lead readers to expect routine and mundane aspects of daily existence, but this book’s content if far from that. The author takes humdrum activities, items, and events, and peels back the scientific layers of what they are and what’s going on. And though she views things through a scientist’s lens, her explanations are enormously accessible and deeply absorbing.A glance at chapter titles themselves are perfect teasers for what readers can expect; however, Czerski in no way limits herself from connecting a vast array of topics and ideas. For example, a chapter on “Popcorn and Rockets” will certainly address the popping of corn and the launching of rockets, but the reader will also learn about katabatic winds, elephants drinking water, focaccia dough, and blueberry jam! Other chapters—such as “Why Don’t Ducks Get Cold Feet” and “Spoons, spirals, and Sputnik”—clearly show the fun-loving side of Czerski.Some critics may complain about how much Ms. Czerski “jumps around” from one topic or idea to another. But to this reviewer, it simply reinforces the reality that we are surrounded in daily life by a wild potpourri of natural and manmade things that have beautiful scientific explanations. Ms. Czerski juxtaposes spinning tops, bubble baths, and why toast invariably falls butter-side down, with surface tension, angular momentum, and the difference between true north and magnetic north.With Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life, Helen Czerski has performed a great service to scientists and nonscientists alike with an entertaining, educational book. The range and depth of her topic coverage illustrate an almost exhaustive diversity, whether it is addressing dizziness, dolphins, and DNA, or atoms, adiabatic heating, and Aristotle. But this is never overdone and generally leaves readers hungrily wanting even more. Czerski’s natural and intense curiosity is infectious. If these qualities are absent, this well-written, delightful, and fast-paced book is guaranteed to bring out the scientist in readers one and all!This reviewer does have one question only Ms. Czerski can answer: when can we expect the next book?"
39,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36651447-will-simpson,5," Great writing, Helen has a super story to tell and tells it with natural enthusiasm. She clearly explains hard physics with everyday situations. She pulls back the curtain on several physics principles.  Science of the small. Gravity is the prominent force at our, the human, scale but the weaker forces gain native strength as the scale gets smaller and funny interesting things begin to happen. Viscosity and surface tension are two samples.  Some science is of the large. Einstein was interested in the large and saw funny and interesting things happen at that scale. Time scales are important and make for some interesting physics. We (humans) are in the middle. What I experience everything in a human (100 year) time scale but that is very different from a planetary or an ATP molecule scale. Things happen differently at different time scales. Helen explains the physics behind this. This book is about the small, the unseen and how the forces and phenomena interact with daily life.  Love this book for what it teaches me and for showing how things fit together with what I’ve learned elsewhere.  Recommended for readers interested in mental models of how the world works and science geeks."
40,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31403872-trung-nguyen-dang,5,"This is an amazing book. It's fun, entertaining and enlightening at the same time. It shares the understanding of the inner working of everyday objects in layman terms. What impresses me the most was the way the author links the same principle across different objects/events/things of different scales seamlessly. For example, linking the same principle of conservation of angular momentum, which can be used to differentiate raw eggs to boiled eggs, to the 6 gyroscopes in the Hubble telescope that gives the telescope reference point, is just wow. The author's passion and enthusiasm is contagious. The audiobook is read by the author herself, which is great. However, I still feel it's best to read a science book, rather than listen to it. With physics, no matter how easy it is explained, I still need to pause and ponder to appreciate it. I am re-reading the digital-ebook to absorb it better.It will be a great gift to your teenager or any adult interested in science. "
41,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,5,"I really enjoyed this for two main reasons. Firstly, the subject was ideal for my (graduate scientist, gave up physics education aged sixteen) level of interest and my understanding of physical sciences. Yes, at times it was a bit simplistic for me, but most of it was perfectly pitched to the intelligent layperson, and there were so so many frequent little bits of new knowledge which were quirky and interesting. Why pigeons walk that way. The word 'katabatic'. More stuff like that.Secondly, Czerski has a really good writing style, clearly she is as excellent a writer as I know she is as a television presenter from the documentaries I have seen her do. It's hard to pinpoint, perchance self-deprecating Northern humour.. it just worked for me - clear explanations, not patronising, personable, variety, and really well grounded in everyday experiences."
42,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321501-deborah,4,"This little book was full of surprises. (Its only 250 pages long.) It talks about gravity, molecules, waves (sound, light, water),time, Sputnik, & ducks! (And more, I think.) Its talks about these subjects in a way I never thought of & brought home the beauty, wonder, & magic (aka science) of our world. It is a hopeful book as well. Ms. Czerski explains things clearly & often delightfully for the general reader. There might have been once or twice I had to reread a paragraph (I chalked that up to aged brain syndrome,) so this book should not scare anyone away. I enjoyed it & learned a lot in the reading."
43,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,4,"That was really nice! A really sweet and personal journey through the physics of everyday things (as advertised) like why duck's feet don't get cold in the winter (they do - and it's important that they do) and why toast falls butter-side down; as well as some less everyday things like the Large Hadron Collider and gravitational waves, but explained in a way that I promise you anyone can understand. I did this as an audiobook and the reader's Northern England accent was amazing. It worked perfectly (as the author is from Manchester) and the whole thing was just a super enjoyable and fun experience. Another winner from the Talk Nerdy podcast!"
44,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21569599-vesna-jusup,2,"2 stars are not reflecting book quality, but my own experience. As art historian working in political sphere i highly appreciate being confronted with natural science vocabulary and stories. But this book just endlessly counts examples with rather squary explanation of psychs laws. So after reading it i am no better equiped to implement, understand or explain them than i was before reading it. Aside maybe two or three stories that got me curious so ended up googling. But if you have no knowledge from schooling or are really out of this world it might be rather easy digest content to get you excited about the world around you."
45,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17595639-sabrina,3,Helen Czerski compares the natural frequency of tea sloshing and buildings in an earthquake. I learnt fascinating facts about heat preservation (why a duck's feet don't get cold) and how magnets help us harvest energy from wind turbines.The book starts off very simply and is great for a beginner to see the science in absolutely every single thing in the world. It is even simple and clear enough to be read with children.
46,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4583065-sidsel-pedersen,5,"Amazing! This book has really been a marvel to read! It's so accessible and entertaining. It explains physics in a way where I did not only understand it and apprised it, but wanted to share it. The book has spawned so many conversations and made me think. It has been a hot to read!I really feel that this is refreshing and expanding my understanding of the physics of the world and it is so well written. One of the best non-fiction books I have read in years!"
47,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,4,"I enjoyed reading this book. It's an easy read and makes good use of real-world examples to explain the physics that's going on all around us all the time. It would appeal to readers without much scientific knowledge and it certainly did a good job of explaining why science is important and exciting!There is a varying degree of quality in the chapters, however. I thought the chapter on waves was strong (apart from saying waves don't shove our world about and cause major disruption having only just talked about earthquakes in the previous chapter!) but the chapter on equilibrium wasn't so good in my opinion. The example experiments you could try at home seemed to dry up towards the last few chapters of the book. The author ducked a few complex questions, e.g. why things carry charges, with a ""that's just the way it is"" which was a little disappointing, but in a book aimed for non-scientists I think that was fair but a pointer to where a reader might learn more might have been good.There were a few factual errors, e.g. how canal locks work and the composition and structure of the Earth's outer core but they didn't distract too much from the message. I did wonder if some of the real-life examples may have been embellished to fit the narrative, e.g. not knowing that snails can crawl upside down seemed a bit odd to me!Overall, a good book and I would definitely recommend it to other readers."
48,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37705826-victoria,4,"Loved this book. Made me think more critically about so many first principles that I don’t acknowledge day to day or take for granted without thinking through any of the ‘why’ behind them. For someone who remembers more high school physics than me, it might be elementary but Czerski does a great job of conveying the wonder of science. Makes me want to go back and restudy more with greater appreciation now as an adult."
49,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34517345-rayne-reid,4,"A really fun and witty read which made me know about so many things I frequently interact with . It will be impossible for me to remember it all, but a lot of it has definitely made me more interested in investigating how everything works =)"
50,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97117245-matthew-smith,5,I really enjoyed this. It's an easily accessible refresher on your high-school and college science courses explained with everyday examples. The last chapter is a poetic summary that was just pleasurable to read (listen to).
51,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60610737-wayne,3,"An interesting read if you are in to nerdy science facts explained simply. If you have much of a science background, you may not get a whole lot out of the book. Nonetheless, there are plenty of good tales and enough to keep you entertained. "
52,0393355470,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29218942-harish-namboothiri,4,"Storm In A Teacup is a book written by a physicist that explains how knowledge of physical laws enhance your understanding about the world that we live in. This understanding can be an enriching experience. After reading this book, I feel this is the way to learn new things. Acquired knowledge, even if it is about subatomic particles, is only useful when we are able to relate it to the small and large phenomena that happens around us. This way of learning can help us in finding ways to improve our lives too."

Helen Czerski clearly loves her work and it shows through in how she explains some pretty complicated concepts in a bite-sized way. I keep coming back to some of the concepts she introduced in my life now, which for me, is a sign of a very good book"

It took physics concepts and applied them to every day life, helping understand physics through processes and moments that we experience every day. The tone could be a bit dull in parts, but there were hints of humor that I enjoyed. Overall, an enjoyable read."

Czerski is passionate about her topic and writes in an engaging, funny and clear way. HIGHLY recommend to everyone who breathes."
