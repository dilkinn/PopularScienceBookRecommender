0,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"(I actually reviewed the UK hardback, with this cover.) This is a weird one - it's a book where I'm really struggling to identify who it's for and what it is supposed to do. The only conclusion I can draw is that Calculating the Cosmos is intended for people who like Ian Stewart's excellent maths books, but who don't usually read popular science books, so need a maths-driven introduction to astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.The particularly odd thing is that despite the subtitle 'how mathematics unveils the universe' there is very little explicit maths in the book - it's mostly just straightforward physics with little prominence given to the mathematical side. And the physics is put across in a fairly heavy handed 'fact, fact, fact...' way - the book is light on narrative throughout. Where it does stray into history there are one or two examples that don't quite get the story straight - for instance, when talking about Newton's development of his gravitational work, Stewart tells us that it took a 'stroke of genius' to see that the Moon is both falling and moving sideways so it misses. What he doesn't point out was that the genius in question was Robert Hooke, not Isaac Newton. This is one of the few points where Newton explicitly says the idea had not occurred to him until Hooke wrote to him about it.Where the book does stand out is where Stewart delves into something that is usually glossed over in a popular science book. Sometimes this content feels a touch 'so what?' - for example in describing the method used to simulate the formation of the Moon - but in other cases, for example the analysis of how comet 67P got its 'rubber duck' shape, the route of the Rosetta probe, and in probably the best explanation of curved spacetime and manifolds I've seen. Best of all, Stewart explains how dark matter could not exist at all, simply being a matter of making the wrong assumptions in combining the interactions of stars in a galaxy and the way he eloquently dissects the many worlds hypothesis (many of the best bits are towards the end of the book). However, these are standout moments amongst a whole collection of information we've seen so many times before, and when he does explain the science, the approach taken is often not easy to grasp - for example his impenetrable use of Penrose diagrams in talking about black holes.The story of the Rosetta probe is probably the closest we come to having some narrative to engage us, but even here the storytelling is bland, and, from a mathematical standpoint, we miss the opportunity to look at a different kinds of mathematical involvement, as there was interesting work done on the scheduling of Rosetta's experiments to deal with the very limited communications bandwidth.This isn't a bad book, but apart from those handful of highlights where something is explained better than elsewhere, most of it fails to bring in anything new and lacks the engaging writing style of, say, Stewart's books written with Terry Pratchett. Here Stewart rarely makes use of mathematical insights to tell us anything different to straightforward familiar astronomy and cosmology, which is a shame as he is so excellent at making maths interesting. For the science, though, we get this distinctly 'here's a fact, here's another fact, here's yet another fact' style of writing. It might work as a book for that maths-based space newcomer, but I'm afraid its not for me."
1,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,5,"I absolutely loved this one. Stewart's writing style is easy to understand for the layman (such as I) without ever being condescending. It's even funny in places and he gets bonus points from quoting both Red Dwarf and the Discworld books.There's not as much mathematics in here as I was expecting, given the title, but I can't bring myself to knock a star off for that. Highly recommended."
2,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"I don't recommend this book for everyone, but it was a perfect fit for me. The last time I read a physics/astronomy book that taught me profound new things was Michio Kaku's Hyperspace. While I can definitely recommend Kaku's work for anyone, this book was more technical. I would say it speaks to a graduate level audience in either math, physics, or astronomy. While these aren't my areas professionally, I am passionately interested in them, so this book spoke my language. Every chapter took a subject with which I was familiar and laid out a laundry list of all the things I didn't know about it, and all the underlying assumptions that aren't set in concrete. I was floored to read about the subtleties and intricate structures within Saturn's rings, for example, a treasure trove of lessons from Mother Earth about how gravity works, and far from settled science. I was equally exhilarated to hear doubts about what Stewart calls ""bolt-ons"" to the Big Bang theory: Inflation, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy. Not because I don't want to ""believe in them,"" whatever that means in a scientific context, but because they are so counter intuitive they cry out for either a better explanation or some measured degree of doubt.The greatest lesson of the book is that science is always provisional. Every theory we have (even the seemingly settled, orthodox ones) are only as good as the observations they match. And every theory we have really only matches 98% of observations. Science is a continual process of improvement and the occasional overhaul. It's a great pleasure to read an author with both expertise and humility, who can illuminate while at the same time casting doubt."
3,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"The first half of the book is a nice survey of our solar system, it's formation, and discovery.The second half goes off the deep end with bizarre dark matter denial, and crank alternatives to the Big Bang. He also gives a totally incorrect description of Schrodinger's cat.The author seems to see himself as an outsider as a Mathematician. He constantly attacks a straw man of the physics community. He says things like, ""nobody thinks about the boundary conditions"" (which is simply false) and ""there's also a tenancy to overstate the implications of the latest idea or discovery"" (which is true about the media, but not about the scientific community).This book is a good example of Max Planck's maxim ""Science progresses one funeral at a time."" This author just can't seem to accept scientific discoveries made after ~1950."
4,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I am not exactly sure what to say about this book. The first 4/5 of it were slow going and didn't seem to bring anything new to the table. I expected this book to have the passion and insight his book Fearful Symmetry, which dealt with patterns found on Earth, did. When this book came out, I rushed to get it, thinking it, like Fearful Symmetry, would open my eyes to the wonderful patterns not just on Earth but in the entire universe. I was mostly disappointed. However, it picked up significantly toward the end when Stewart took an analytical sledgehammer to the Big Bang theory, dark matter, and inflation. That alone made the rest of the book worth reading. Also, Stewart's descriptions of star type (what determines a red dwarf, brown dwarf, neutron, etc) and the evolution of stars was the best I have read yet. "
5,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,Jumps around a lot but starts with Scientific revolution and the solar system and moves out into the stars the galaxy and the universe and it ends on the big bang and cosmology. As far as covering the topics it does fairly well but the narrative is fairly jumpy. I think it could be organized better.
6,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,5,I'm so sorry I finished this - I just wanted it to go on and on and now I don't want to give it back to the library. I found it a new (for me) perspective on cosmological ideas and that helped me learn a lot. In the end I'm neither a mathematician nor a cosmologist so I have no worry about things being true or false at this stage and I can just enjoy the ideas.
7,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76939280-drugh,5,"A fascinating tour of how we understand the cosmos. Stewart has the ability to expound, without getting bogged down in technical details, on the most interesting subjects, like chaos, galaxies, comets, moon, and stars. He puts each part in its historical context and then unveils more recent discoveries which are often much more complex and elegant than what imagined. I appreciate his scientific flexibility and he writes with a sense of a continual process of discovery. The book has its thumb on the pulse of lively research."
8,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71830385-eugenio-viola,4,"Nice book, great for those who are wondering what is mathematics for and how the whole cosmos can be simplified to equations and numbers. "
9,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56603341-erica,4,"Diving into an astrophysics publication so cleverly titled as Calculating the Cosmos: How Mathematics Unveils the Universe, readers would expect a lengthy and complex account of the vitality of mathematics in the astrophysical world filled with heavy scientific terminology. However, University of Warwick professor and popular-science author Ian Stewart effectively constructs his book on the relationship between math and astronomy in a way that is comprehensible and enjoyable even for the average reader lacking any prior knowledge of astrophysics. From a mathematician’s perspective he explores the various ways and specific instances in which the use of math helps find answers to scientific questions or to bring scientists one step closer to finding answers. Such questions include: What is the likelihood of intelligent life existing outside of planet Earth? What might such extraterrestrials look like? What alternative theories are there to the big bang? What is the shape of the universe? Why are we here? Is it possible that there are more universes than the one we inhabit? Stewart explores these concepts as well as gravity, the formation of the moon, the content of Saturn’s rings, spectroscopy, and black holes - all of which have some relation to mathematical principles, as difficult as it may be to believe. There’s even a mathematical explanation for the gap between planetary orbits - a pattern, in fact! Since ancient times, astronomers and mathematicians have utilized components of geometry and calculus to gain a better understanding of how the world works. In Calculating the Cosmos, Stewart emphasizes the absolute necessity of these mathematical techniques in order to obtain answers.  Although Stewart’s purpose of the book is evidently to convince readers of the importance of math in scientific discovery, specifically in relation to astrophysics, the majority of the math explained in the book is not explicit. He does offer a few equations and calculations that may leave the mathematically-challenged with a headache, but for the most part, the physics is fairly straightforward and demonstrated concisely with the experience and knowledge of the general public in mind. Therefore, much of the science is understandable for readers who have a high school education and therefore a foundation for comprehending the more complicated concepts. Still, some points of description went a little overboard with basic physics such as the concept of momentum, while at other points, short passages of complex science might deserve a quick re-read. In that respect, there was some inconsistency, albeit little of it. Moreover, he emphasizes how intricate and complicated the math can be, and simultaneously expensive and time-consuming. One wouldn’t expect much on the narrative side of things, but Stewart delves into the history of currently accepted theories and chronicles the discoveries that led to our modern understanding of the universe. For some readers, these tidbits may even be more engaging than all the numbers and calculations. In addition, Stewart includes a few pop culture references - from a Joni Mitchell song about stardust to science fiction’s portrayal of humanoid aliens - in order to add a bit of humor to his writing. He keeps his diction simplified to ensure understanding among the everyday readers, although when it is necessary to use astronomical jargon he includes a synonym alongside the vocabulary. For example, libration is a fancy term for wobbles (Stewart 42). To help with comprehension of some of the more difficult concepts, Stewart offers sufficient analogies such as comparing the search of trojan asteroid blips in light curves to the search of lion tracks in a game reserve (194). Stewart writes with exceptional flair and takes advantage of various sentence structures, especially very short sentences for emphasis. He keeps an upbeat and slightly subjective tone throughout the book that almost makes one forget that they are reading a book about science.  A few passages were slow, but in general, the book was fast-paced. A few topics were not explored fully in depth as much as they could have been, such as the gravitational evidence for dark matter, although that can be respected as an artistic choice. There is a lot of information already presented throughout the chapters, evidently more about breadth than depth. Ideas seem to become more outlandish as the book progresses, partially chronological in the history of discoveries and partially working from small scale to large scale in terms of celestial objects (from talking about asteroids to planets to galaxies to the universe itself).  It is admirable that Stewart addresses the nature of astronomy and science itself. Although not as explicit, it is clear that he encourages readers to think critically and not accept theory as fact as he would often repeat the notion of scientists correcting other’s (or even their own) mistakes and always trying to prove things wrong. That’s how science works. As Stewart says himself, “if no one is allowed to get things wrong, no progress will ever be made” (261). He acknowledges this fundamental idea while remaining skeptical of some of astronomy’s most recent theories, such as the multiverse theory. At the same time, he encourages readers to never doubt what is possible in the realm of astrophysics because there was once a time when spaceflight was believed to be impossible and people could not fathom the idea of landing on the moon. Sure, Stewart makes some phenomena such as comets and extraterrestrial life not as exciting and dramaticized as they are in science fiction films. However, it is important to know the basis for the mathematical principles and scientific theories behind such phenomena in order to understand why accurate, precise measurements and careful calculations are important. In cases such as sending a space shuttle full of humans into orbit, misunderstandings and miscalculations can be costly - even deadly. In general, the book is very well written and serves as an excellent source for both information and entertainment for any reader who is interested in the ever intertwining relationship between math and science. Ian Stewart’s Calculating the Cosmos allows readers to gain a deeper understanding of the significance of mathematics as well as develop an appreciation for all it has contributed - not only to astrophysics, but to the world as a whole.

10,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56045633-benjamin-uke,4,"I can't think of any book on mathematics that I have actively enjoyed listening too before.The book traces the evolution of mathematics and its links to astronomy starting with the Babylonian integration of mathematics into the study of astronomy and cosmology and working up to the modern day. New readers beware, this book will awaken dormant parts of your brain, blossoming concepts and reinvigorating the old while giving you a love of the beauties of existence. If you're into that sort of thing.My only major caveat to the quality is that the constantly building material makes it approachable at first but a bit incoherent later in the book, but I attribute that to my own inexperience if nothing else."
11,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,5,An utterly fascinating discussion of all things cosmological. Ian Stewart explains all of the various aspects of the cosmos in such a clear and concise way that it makes the incomprehensible understandable. He also describes the math behind these mindblowing concepts in such a way that even someone as mathematically challenged as myself can almost grasp it. Truly a remarkable book.
12,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6161999-steve-gross,4,"A really nice overview of modern cosmology. My only cavil with the book is that it is more ""Cosmos"" than ""Caclulating"". Don;t read it for the math, read it for the astrophysics."
13,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92817623-james-p,4,"In my attempts to read this book, I had about five false starts. I kept giving up. I’d make it, like, twenty pages in and just throw my hands up. I returned it to the library and checked it out again and again, trying to get through it. I was a probe sent to land on a faraway planet and mission control back home just couldn’t get the knack.Then, after the early days when the coronavirus began to affect our lives, I made a final dash to our local library and I picked this book up—again.Briefly, Stewart’s book is an absolute kick. Somehow, even though the language is often about as over-my-head as Voyager 1 (or 2, I forget), the amount of material discussed is just plain awe inspiring. But there were many, many sections I had to just sprint through. I could reread this book twenty times and still not understand most of it.This varies from a lot of other physics books I’ve read, like those written by Carl Sagan, Steven Hawking or Carlo Rovelli.Just the same, Ian Stewart’s English humor and sensibility was a huge plus. Toward the end of the book, the author started tearing through a bunch of different theories about the origins and fate of the universe and raising questions about them all. I sense that even he was sprinting to the end. In conclusion, Stewart completely leaves the door open for subsequent scientific work on the subject. And that was refreshing and reassuring to read."
14,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58574789-sanjay-banerjee,5,"The book moves from the formation of the Earth and the Moon to the planets and asteroids of the solar system and then to the wider universe. The architecture of space and time, how galaxies form, why stars implode, how everything began and how it will all end - are described by the author. Beginning with the Babylonian integration of mathematics into the study of astronomy and cosmology, the book traces the evolution of our understanding of the cosmos - how Kepler’s laws of planetary motion led Newton to formulate his theory of gravity, how the motion of Mars led to Einstein formulating his general theory of relativity, how the discovery of the fact of expanding universe led to the development of the Big Bang theory and, in turn, led to theorize new components like inflation, dark matter and dark energy. The author also finally highlights the inconsistencies that have developed and the still unexplained observations and leaves us with the question whether a new theory and thinking is required.A great book but may be somewhat technical especially related to some mathematical concepts."
15,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"This is a very readable account of the mathematics that underlie several of the most important concepts and phenomena in modern astrophysics. Stewart is at his best when dissecting the current theories of galaxy formation as well as the theories of our own moon's formation; these sections are not only very readable but also quite thorough and captivatingly written. Additionally, his brief discussion at the end of book surrounding the fundamental flaws in notions of the, ""fine-tuning,"" of our universe's cosmological constants is an excellent précis to the more thorough work on this subject by Victor Stenger. His disagreement with multiverse theory is presented well though much too briefly and a greater amount of material here would have made for extremely interesting reading. This is an important book that I would recommend to those with a background in the math and theories behind the subjects discussed. "
16,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20595684-ronald-mccoy,5,"Excellent book. Unlike a lot of books in this genre, this book is no Mia rehash of the same old narratives. You can see that the author really understands the mathematics behind what he’s talking about. He goes into a lot more depth than your average description of the universe, but at all times he’s very clear. There were a lot of new concepts I had never heard of before which I will now follow up. The chapter on the orbital dynamics on the solar system is really good. The author is also not afraid to be critical of currently health theories, talking about their issues. There is a lot to think about in this book, and I thoroughly recommend it."
17,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25110006-bree,3,"The first 13 chapters were pitched at a perfect level where the maths wasn’t shied away from but it was balanced nicely with stories and history. The rest of the book was too technical and required a lot of concentration so although the author attempted to keep that lighter, conversational tone - it did not work under the high level maths and the brain breaking quantum mechanics. tl;dr my brain hurts but it was worth it ultimately "
18,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14671945-kian,5,"A journey by the means the mathematics and physics, starting from the Earth to the remotest possible place in the universe.Ian Stewart explain enough of almost everything, not much in depth for the novices nor too shallow to makes one who already knew somethings bored.Best introductuon to the astrophysics I've read so far.The amount of knowledge that has been cover properly in this book is enough for one to feel the satisfaction of it at the end."
19,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8663503-david,5,"Excellent and accessible explanation of the development of current thinking about the the origins and future of the universe (...or universes...). Author Ian Stewart provides not only the basis for the current theories, but also the ideas developing as to how those theories need additional work to resolve a number of outstanding issues."
20,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,3,"Fairly conventional, with a dose of skepticism towards the newer concepts such as dark matter, dark energy and older concepts like the big bang. Not satisfying, though, as it's neither convincing nor providing any interesting alternatives. Also, it's a bit over-committed to the ""calculating"" part, unless you're RainMan."
21,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20543252-michael-myers,4,"There remains so much we do not know about the Universe. This book does a good job of conveying what we believe we know, issues surrounding our theories about the universe, and conveys the great mysteries remaining to be resolved. It leaves one with a great sense of humility concerning our knowledge of the mysteries of life, the universe and our place in the Cosmos."
22,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85655533-anna-cook,4,"A great and informative read. Some concepts are a little difficult to fathom for the reader who hasn't delved into space and physics before, but I thought he did a good job none the less. I liked his views on the progression of science and thought his thought process in the book flowed well."
23,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034045-chuy-ruiz,4,"Math ftw! An enjoyable read that takes you through the history of the universe according to math. It's really quite fascinating how much of the natural world can be described in terms of equations. This is a topic that could have been a dry read, but it definitely was not. "
24,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101425908-melanie-crisp,5,Great book for laymen and those wanting to enter into studies in astrophysics. The book's title is a bit of a misnomer in that the book does not have a lot of math - it is more a general overview of latest in the fields of cosmology.
25,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13186187-ions,4,"Informative, but kind of a dry info dump. The author peppers some humor to break it up, it the audiobook was like a 12.5 Great Courses course. Props the the 2 Pratchett quotes, I legit smiled when they popped up!"
26,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755486-melinda,4,Great read. Lots of concepts discussed here...many went over my head - but an interesting read none-the-less. Made me think that there are alot of very clever people in this world.
27,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17757241-leonard-kim,4,But I don’t recommend the audiobook which has numerous questionable and distracting readings and pronunciations.

31,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3176609-nate,3,"I love books dealing with astrophysics....especially ones like this that focus on my favorite bits: black holes, vulcanoids, and the Kuiper belt. 😀"
32,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57635403-cosmic-jae,4,Very intriguing and fascinating read. The author is first and foremost a mathematician. So a lot of the chapters are written from that perspective. He takes you chronologically from how the ancients calculated orbiting planets and stars to modern technology’s use of computers to simulate the Big Bang. There is a fascinating chapter on the math behind Einstein’s cosmological constant and the redshifts of galaxies. 
33,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11066575-madhav-sinha,5,Ian Stewart has written a good book discussing main mathematical ideas facilitating the amazing insights of modern physics. And some of his own ideas on the current fashions of physics! But no discussion on Max Tegmark's ideas of universe as mathematical structures!
34,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"This book is a bit hard to rate. Stewart intends to explain many of the interesting details of astronomy, astrophysics, etc. via the mathematics involved. However, he often either doesn't explain the math well, or even doesn't mention it at all!Nevertheless, the book was quite interesting. He covers a wide range of topics--gravity, elliptical orbits, the abnormally large size of our moon, asteroids, the distance between the planets, the rings of Saturn, Lagrange points, spectroscopy, the milky way, black holes, the age/size of the universe, etc.One of the most interesting discussions was the one involving scientists' increasing dissatisfaction with the Big Bang theory as it is currently formulated. For instance, galaxies withe huge redshifts, which ought to date to less than a billion years after the Big Bang, ought to be dominated by young, superhot blue stars. But many contain way too many old, cool red stars. Why? And why are there large superclusters of galaxies at high redshift, which wouldn't have had time to organize into such large structures? Perhaps other explanations are needed, especially involving reshift and cosmic background microwave radiation.If there's anything this book makes clear, it is that the theories are always changing. A hundred years from now, it's quite possible we won't believe in black holes or the big bang. Who knows. The science remains fascinating, even if Stewart doesn't always do a great job at laying it out clearly."
35,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109369526-kuldeep-charan,4,"Having interest in mathematics yes I'm of course biased to this book. Cosmos is based on upon mathematics and how the subject helped these fields progress.This book covers all the historic great mathematicians- I.e. newton, laplace, gauss, riemann, etc and highlights their Their contribution in understanding of solar system and beyond. Further there's a very little need of understanding advanced mathematics- very few formulas and the ones that he uses are those that we studied in high school. He does review some advanced mathematical theories, especially the ones leading up Einstein's theory of relativity, but if don't you understand mathematics, you can still understand the essence of what he is sharing.Further I enjoyed the criticism of the current theories of dark matter, dark energy, multi-universe, string theory. As he states, the math is interesting but the conclusion are faulty he suggests that physicists have gone down the Wrong path to make sure that there formulas are work."
36,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87100873-thom-abeln,5,"Really interesting, a little bit more difficult than the average space related book but that's actually what made it so interesting. If you love to know more about the mathematics and physics that ""control"" the universe, then this is definitely a book you want to read. Also his way of writing is enjoyable, he knows how to make quite dry information easy to read and has a good sense of humor."
37,0465096107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2523117-eric,2,"In addition to the errors noted by other reviewers: - During a section on simultaneity in special relativity, the author wrongly claims that the causality of two events in spacetime can be reversed. - The chapter on dark matter fails to mention gravitational lensing, even in passing. Instead, the author spends much of the chapter discussing alternate theories of gravity, none of which have gained widespread acceptance.- The book feels rushed in many ways. Figures frequently appear without being directly referenced in the text. Several pages of color plates are also included, but never mentioned. A few page headers don't match the chapter title. I was glad that the author included several topics that don't often get discussed in popular astrophysics books (the chaotic nature of planetary orbits, n-body simulations, smooth particle hydrodynamics). However, the whole book suffers from a lack of attention to detail and several rather large errors."
