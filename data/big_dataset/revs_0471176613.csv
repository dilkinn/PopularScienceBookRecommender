When it comes to history of mathematics presented in an easy and fun to follow manner, i'm a sucker. The level of the book is not terribly high. Some parts require only to be aware of some ideas, others some familiarity with basic high school mathematics and some to have some previous experience. The most requiring subject to understand was differential and integral calculus to give you an idea. The contents include a lot of mathematical ideas, how they evolved, interesting stories about great mathematicians, interesting proofs. I highly recommend it"
1,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70318520-sohum,4,"William Dunham's non-fiction book, The Mathematical Universe, is an enthralling book which takes readers on a journey through some of the most popular algebraic and geometric proofs, such as Runges Theorem and proving the value of pi. Despite its title and subject, the book was unexpectedly interesting as Dunham found a way to connect or relate these concepts of thought to any scholar's standard education. For instance, when discussing the differentiation of integrals, Dunham some how managed to relate the calculus involved in this process to basic polynomial fundamentals, which any educated middle-schooler should have knowledge of. In essence, Dunham has found a way to put complicated math concepts in terms in which even those with the most basic of educational backgrounds can understand, thereby expanding the range of the book's audience. However, when I checked this book out from my school's library, I had noticed that it had been untouched for an extended period of time, which was expected. Students would not often find this book interesting as they may not have a vested interest in mathematics, which is a recurring pattern with most students. Dunham, however still attempts to draw the attention of young students by placing comic strips or puns in his book, so that it may appeal to a younger audience. The most striking characteristic of this book was not the fact that it covered such wide branches of mathematics in a small amount of pages, but the fact that it placed it in terms in which any student could comprehend such concepts without being hindered by their lack of knowledge in mathematics when compared to college graduate."
2,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,A very consice introduction to the mathematical world. Reads great. Definitely a must read.
3,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502157-david,4,"A solid, clear overview of mathematics, both simple and advanced. For anyone who wants a grounding in general math topics, this seems just about perfect. For someone who wants a more organized system, this will disappoint you (he jumps from topic to topic, based on the alphabet), and for someone like me who wants tougher questions answered (""what is Hilbert space?"" ""What is a Cauchy sequence?"" etc.), this won't do much to help. But even though I realized it was the wrong book for my project, I kept reading it anyway because the author is clearly having so much fun. I'd heard that this was something of a classic, and now I know the reason."
4,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33419412-raj-sharma,5,Most interesting popular Mathematics book. Parents of students wanting illustrious careers must read this book themselves and let their wards read it. This book can lay the path for young boys to become great mathematicians for the new world.
5,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,4,"A understable book whith a background of high shool level;it is alphabeticlly ordered ,for example L for Leibnitz,E for Euler,D for diferential calculus ,P for prime number theorem and so on"

7,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12833631-dick-harding,4,I enjoyed this more than expected. It is a wide smattering of math and it's history. Some of the math seemed to be a bit beyond me but all in all I enoyed it.
8,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96009346-john-volpe,5,Awesome book! Definitely my favorite author.
9,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16177673-chelsea-m,3,"I liked the author's style - witty, but casual and disarming. The stories and analyses of the ""background"" behind histories and characters of mathematics fascinated me, but the mathematical ideas themselves were rather simple, most of it being at high-school level. I wish I had found this book a few years before, when these ideas were new to me."
10,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7573754-emma,0,"Because I couldn't write this for the work I had to do on it. An alphabetised look on the whole of maths, as good as a work of fiction but with complicated maths as a storyline and 18th Century mathematicians as characters."
11,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092429-scott,4,"A fascinating(and often humorous) look at the history of mathematics and the personalities involved in it's development. It's written to the non-mathematician, so don't let the subject matter dissuade you from reading it. Great book. "
12,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,4,"This is a great book to introduce some of history's fascinating and lesser-known mathematicians. I read it primarily for some background on Euler, but also found interesting information about Newton, Liebniz and others. "
13,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2136561-brett,4,Dunham really has a gift at making mathematics readable. Fun stuff.
14,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3507298-jianliang,5,Very inspiring.
15,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3763598-jennifer,4,Really enjoyable and enlightening book - does rather stretch a point or two on it's alphabetical nature but well put together
16,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12183125-john,4,Entertaining walk through a Mathematical alphabet of mathematics and mathematicians. Dense material yet easy read. 
17,0471176613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78911-katie,4,Total nerd book but I liked it. :)
