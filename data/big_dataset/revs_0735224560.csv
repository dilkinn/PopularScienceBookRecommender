0,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Flipper is far overrated, the underrepresented (except Free Willy) whales are at least as astonishing.Luckily the creepy days of mass whale slaying are over, just the rusting remains of the huge whale processing facilities stay as a warning against the overexploitation of nature. The few remaining countries with traditional or so-called scientific whaling are the least problem. Instead, the ever-louder ocean with stronger communication tools for the growing world ship population, pollution and the unknown, coming effects of climate change and global warming are and are becoming a problem. Maybe a more whale friendly navigating technology may be found or the whales adapt to the new circumstances by altering their communication process or even physiology. Who knows, nature is very creative in dealing with new circumstances. Intuitively one might probably think that such a large animal might take longer to change ist behavior, but their brain is not just big, but smart too, although sometimes size certainly matters.There is big and there is whaleBIG. Just the numbers how quick they grow while they drink vast amounts of milk (more than 250 Liters a day) until becoming really huge and eating until a stomach that can hold two tons is full. An interesting question may be how big they are going to get. Assuming the climate change may improve the conditions and turn large enough areas of the oceans in a kind of underwater rainforest paradise( a cold one, cause the colder the climate, the bigger the animals) where they have enough food all the time, they might get even bigger. Or the whole oceanic foodchain may collapse otherwise.It is immense how much can be reconstructed just by analyzing and comparing fossils. With today's modern technologies and coming help from AI the few lonely, unrelated skeletons and open questions may be solved soon. How animals went on land and off the land or stayed in the coastal zone or thought, ""Damn it, I am going to adapt to the highlands or deeper areas of the sea where I can live in peace."", is just amazing. How their bodies adapted to each new environment and still adapt at this moment, how each climate and food availability could be made a home with ingenuity. Especially whale graveyards are both a great possibility to study the history and a reason to ask the question, how intelligent and sensitive whales might be. If it might turn out that they go to die in certain places and/or these places are visited by their family, that might be a milestone. The development of blowholes, the adaption of bones that were originally built for a higher gravity, how the body and organs deal with the extreme freediving trips. And, of course, epic fights to the death between a sperm whale and giant squid. It might get even more entertaining if the squid lived in one of the many areas where nuclear waste used to (or still is) be stored temporarily until a secure form of final disposal will be found. Many deep seas creatures are bioluminescent, but that might add a special touch. Probably even the legendary octopus/ Kraken, now with glowing, nuclear superpowers, who cooperates with the giant squid against the sperm whale. The look in a far future, million years from now, is even more interesting with an animal that has already been on land in the form of Pakicetus, got better adjusted to the sea as Ambulocetus and finally became a real whale with all the different adaptions to eating just plankton or meat. Out of that grew more pacifistic or aggressive species of whales and one cannot imagine what will come. I mean, freaking gangster, Chuck Norris style Orcas have begun killing white sharks cause they like their liver and other organs. All other marine animals think ""Oh my god, a shark, we are all gonna die."", and the killer wales like ""Hold my kelp beer and my seal burger for a moment...""And after the massacre, the orca thinks: ""Nah, I wasn't even hungry, I will just eat the most delicious parts an leave the rest behind."" Sharks are really poor victims, humans cut their fins off from above and the orcas come coordinated from all sites. One must be a smart badass to do that. And just like chimps and dolphins, especially Orcas may tend to be cruel for no reason too."
1,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53419883-scarlett-readz-and-runz-through-novel-time-distance,5,"Spying on Whales is a beautifully written introduction to the immersive world of whales. From their ancestry to their future, the beauty and evolution of these magnificent creatures as well as their adaptability, influence and importance to their and other ecosystems is explored in easy terms anyone can understand. This is the endeavor of Nick Pyenson, a paleontologist and curator at the Smithsonian Institute, who shares his passion for whales and the history their bones tell us. He himself considers paleontologists tour guides, since they are used to asking questions without having all the facts. Fossils studied are often removed from context, and therefore only give clues to draw inferences from. In this book, Pyenson presents a selective account of chasing whales, both living and extinct. Otherwise you would find yourself reading an encyclopedia for each whale species. He describes his experiences: ”…from Antarctica to the deserts of Chile, to the tropical coastlines of Panama, to the waters of Iceland and Alaska, using a wide variety of devices and tools to study whales: suction-cupped tags that cling to their backs; knives to dissect skin and blubber from muscles and nerves; and hammers to scrape and whack away rock that obscures gleaming, fossilized bone.” – Nick PyensonCheck out the Peyenson Lab:http://nmnh.typepad.com/pyenson_lab/ Spying on Whales is divided into parts:Part I tells us about the PAST. A chronicle of whale history from mammals walking on land to their transition to aquatic animals. This is the part scientists rely mostly on fossil records. It therefore explains how paleontologists look for clues and what questions they have to ask themselves to uncover the details presented. This information borderlines with other sciences and tells us about whales in geological time. Pyenson specifically spends a greater part of detail on the discovery and his works at Cerro Ballena, the world’s richest fossil whale graveyard. Here is the link for Cerro Ballena:http://cerroballena.si.edu/imagesPart II tells about the PRESENT. How did whales become the biggest creatures ever in the history of life? What are the challenges of sustaining such enormous sizes? Here is where we learn about biological processes of whales and Pyenson’s work at a whaling station. What are the challenges of studying organisms of such size? What are his newest discoveries? Part III explores the (uncertain) FUTURE of whales. It informs of population rates, climate change, new habitats, other species affected, changes in the oceans and new unusual whale sightings. We have all heard, read and seen the tragedies unfold by the hands of humans affecting whales and their co-inhabitants of our oceans. Therefore, I want to assure those that have asked me if it is a depressing book to read, that there are no horrific pictures or scenes depicted in this book. Part III acknowledges this, but does not harbor on these. Rather it explains scientific works needed, the news of other scientific findings and the collective deduction that perhaps gives hope to further investigations.  “My hope is that this book says as much about the inner lives of scientists as it does about whales.”  – Nick PyensonI was fortunate to have two copies of this book available to me. One was the audio book version and the other a copy from the library. The narrator on the audio book was Nick Pyenson himself. That is always a plus. To hear the author express his writings in his own voice made it conversationally easy to understand and added emphasis on what was most important to him scientifically as well as distinctively convey his message to the reader. As I was finishing up my listening and began to dig into some of the author’s research, I became aware that there are drawings in the book that I did not want to miss. Lucky for me I was able to get a copy of the book at the library. There are many interesting facts that come into play in Spying on Whales. More then I can list here. Upon reading this book and discussing it with others, I was confirmed that whale bones in particular are a great example to study evolutionary history on. Pyenson presents this with clear examples, his love and experience for paleontology and the changes that have occurred over time. Not only in whales, but in mammals and other aquatic animals. From bone structures (skulls, hips, tails, fins) to senses like eyesight, hearing and blow holes and to communication, order of species and socialization.  The fact is, the oceans are like the frontier that still offers plenty of room for discovery. My take-away from this book is that there are passionate people around the world working tirelessly in their respective fields. It is not only a race against time, but a journey to understanding more of the past that tells the story to our now. I am not a scientist, for certain. I merely have a general interest or thirst for knowledge. This book presents a glimpse into the life of whales and the study of paleontology and it quenches this desire for a little while, till I discover another topic and book to delve into. It certainly suits as an introduction for curious students perhaps to pursue the sciences, research, fieldwork if not at least create compassion for living things. I certainly would recommend it as such. My awe for whales has only been fueled thanks to the things I learned and did not know before this book. I would love for everyone to read it as it reads effortless and interestingly. It is books like this one that lead to more searches online, create more engagement by its audience, instill awareness, hence spread knowledge in the general populous. Give it a try.

2,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,3," I was really excited when I saw and read about this book. Whales are such majestic and mysterious creatures and I thought it would be a fascinating read. Unfortunately, no. Spying on Whales was actually quite dull and boring. How is that even possible for a book on 
WHALES
?? This book was all over the place rather than written in any type of linear fashion. It jumped from paleontology to whaling expeditions to stories about scientists to the evolution of whales to their anatomy and back and forth and around and around. Just when I started to get interested in something, the author would jump to another topic. Rather than answer questions, he simply framed more. I learned little about whales in this book, sadly. I realise that partly this is because there is much about whales that we humans still do not know; however, the blurb of the book was quite tantalizing, dangling the promise of answers, compelling me to read the book. OK, I went and read the synopsis again. Perhaps I should have read it better before; it says, ""Nick Pyenson's research has given us the answers to 
some
 of our biggest questions about whales"". So there it is: This book has some (very few) answers. Maybe I'm just greedy and expect too much, but when I read a science book, I want to actually learn something. There were a handful of interesting tidbits, making this not a total wash-out:•The record of time a whale has been recorded holding its breath is 137.5 minutes. That's over 2 hours' worth of oxygen sucked into its lungs!•Whales have the same individual finger bones as humans (though they are flat, wrapped together in flesh, and streamlined into fins).•Whales have culture, culture being defined as the ""kind of information stored outside an animal’s DNA that can be transmitted across individuals or generations"".•Whales can live to be over 200 years old.Unfortunately, the book contained much more about paleontology and stories of bone-collecting expeditions than whale facts. If you're into paleontology, you might like this book more than I did. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 (half star awarded for the gorgeous cover)."
3,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,5,"I've always had a fascination with whales, dolphins and other mammals that live in the sea. I think maybe it's because they are so like us, and yet so different at the same time. When I saw this book written by a Smithsonian paleontologist, I knew I had to read all about the past, present and future of whales. I'm glad I did -- this book is fascinating!Nick Pyenson shares so many facts about whales...species that still swim in our oceans and ones that are long gone. He discusses the ancestors of the whales we know today, the life of whales now and what the future might be for some of the largest creatures on the planet. There is still so much about whales that we don't know because they spend most of their time in deep ocean where even modern humans have a hard time following. I found it fascinating that Pyenson shared the fact that some whales can live more than 200 years...so there are some still swimming that saw wooden ships with sails skimming across the ocean. It made me wonder with awe what experiences the oldest whale in the world might have had over its long life. There is a lot of information and facts shared in this book, and at times Pyenson does get a bit academic. I read this book in small pieces, not in large chunks. The information is interesting and fascinating. But at times, the author let his ego show a bit. I don't fault highly educated people for this at all....they have a lot of knowledge and experiences that I don't. For me, small doses is best with information dense nonfiction like this book. Every night I would read a chapter or two while the HD television across the room showed an ocean documentary for ambiance. It just so happened that I was reading this book while Shark Week was on Discovery Channel....so it worked out perfectly. Sharks aren't whales of course...but the lovely ocean scenes made a perfect background for my enjoyment of this book. Lovely book! A nice blend of Pyenson's personal experiences and facts, history and information about whales themselves. He presents the information in an interesting way. Pyenson actually gives tours at the Smithsonian. After reading his book, I imagine he is an awesome guide! Great read! **I voluntarily read a review copy of this book from Penguin/Viking via NetGalley. All opinions expressed are entirely my own.**"

They hold a very symbolic meaning for me and so I couldn't wait to get this book. The book itself is still fascinating but exciting? Not so much. Written by a scientist, it reads a bit like a science book. Nick Pyenson was extremely thorough in laying out the evolution of whales. I'm sorry to say it wasn't enough to keep my attention for long periods of time. I'm still in absolute awe of whales. I mean, look at that book cover, wow! 2.5 stars rounded up."
6,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"13th book for 2019.One of my jobs as a scientific journal editor was to commission review articles on topics of general interest from leading scientists in the field. A surprising number of reviews were unusable because the author decided to base the entire ""review"" around their own work. And this is a major problem with Pyenson's book. Most of the book is a somewhat rambling collection of his own experiences as a scientist without any real breadth. So there's lots about his own excavations of whale skeletons and somewhat random facts about whale anatomy (basically facts pertinent to his own previous research), but very little about other scientists work. Not even very systematic facts about the life cycle of whales, their distribution, their social networks; presumably because that was the work of other scientists. And he is constantly name dropping the fact that he's working for the Smithsonian. Get over it!Nice cover though!2-stars."
7,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague. An excellent, non-technical, introduction to the marvelous animals known as whales. But, Pyenson's love of his field, paleontology, is obvious and it opened up a new insight for me as to how this field functions. Quite well done!Pyenson's time at the Smithsonian has been instrumental in the creation of this book. We learn about the different types of whales and how they evolved over the millennia. Pyenson explains the various field programs he has been on and what he has found. We accompany him to the Atacama desert where he looks at fossils and explores his inner thoughts about the longevity of whales (some can live to be 200 years old!!), all the way to the Antarctic where he looks for more evidence of whale evolution. His love of his field and whales shines through.He breaks the book down into three parts: past, present and future.The past covers how whales went from four-legged animals to the majestic water dwellers we know today.The present looks at the state of whales currently and the future ruminates on how humanity and whales can co-exist and what humanity can learn about these amazing creatures.A great book for anyone interested eiother in whales or in paleontology. "
8,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706640-jamieson,3,"So, whales are one of my favourite animals like they are so beautiful, so majestic, and some of them are so huge it's mind-boggling! I was definitely one of those kids reading those huge whale encyclopedias in primary school (you know the ones where it lists all the species and shows their size compared to school buses). Yeah, so I've never got over that, I love whales!Spying on Whales is a book I saw get a lot of hype last year after it won a Goodreads Choice Award, so I really wanted to pick it up and see what all the hype was about! I can see why people enjoyed this, it's a really short book that packs in a lot of information, and has a strong personal voice that runs through the entire book. Pyenson is obviously really passionate about his work, and infuses this book with a lot of personal stories and research that helps fill between the jargon and academic sections. Some of my favourite sections included the evolution of whales, and how they went from land mammals to aquatic mammals. The small discussion on the ethics of killing endangered whales for scientific research, and some of the new research emerging about whales, like how some live for 200 years!But even though I liked this book overall, I did have some issues. For one, this wasn't structured well. Even though it's separated into past, present and future, there isn't really much distinction in the sections. The present section I expected to be about the future of whales, but a lot was about extinct whales of the past, which was weird. The author also would start on a topic, then randomly cut to another without a proper linking topic. I also found the heavy focus on the author's stories kind of annoying - I personally don't like science books that focus more on the writer than the research. The way the story cut between a story the author was telling, and the factual bits, annoyed me and again, really needed more linking and structure to make it less choppy. That said, this was still a nice, short non-fiction with some really interesting tidbits about whale life that were definitely fascinating. It just wasn't my favourite in terms of writing and structure. "
9,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,5,"Wonderful book about whales. Mostly focused on whale fossils and the paleobiology of whales. Well written, great information. Beware: there are some graphic passages about whales being processed by a whaling ship. Definitely recommended for biologists interested in cetaceans. There's also a nice reading list at the end with some great suggestions for follow up reading!"
10,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5209447-princesspwny,2,"I wanted very much to enjoy this book, but it was dry and poorly focused. The emphasis was on personal experiences and the paleontology/taxonomy, without strongly addressing the compelling questions in the jacket blurb. Although there are some illustrations, they are overly simplistic and seemed to be decorative and not informative. The notes section is good and provides interesting references and additional resources."
11,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49523912-steve-nolan,2,"I think having read ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" right before reading this really soured this one for me - there was more paleontology in this book than there was in the dino book. "

I sat transfixed by a sea littered with a million fragments of ice, all rising and falling in time with the slow roll of the waves. We had spent the morning looking for humpback whales in Wilhelmina Bay, threading our rubber boat between gargantuan icebergs that were tall and sharp, like overturned cathedrals. We had come to the end of the Earth to place a tag on one of these massive oceangoing mammals. 
Written by the curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian, Spying on Whales is a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of whales over tens of millions of years. The book is divided into three parts: past, present, and future, focusing mainly on whale evolution, biology related to feeding, and the impact of human behavior on whales. Pyenson is an eloquent writer, weaving just the right amount of story-telling into the narrative. (For me, facts are like chocolate chips and the story is the cookie dough. You need some dough so the book isn’t too dry, but I like the chocolate bits best.)As a paleontologist, Pyenson has a sweeping and confident story to tell about the fossil record, not only from studying the amazing collection at the Smithsonian and other museums, but also through his own adventures in fossil hunting from Alaska to the Artic. (He seems to view himself as a kind of Indiana Jones figure, which I found amusing.) I was amazed to read about the transformation of whales from small four-legged animals that lived on riverbanks to oceanic leviathans that use adaptations like echolocation. I had no idea that whales are the largest animals to ever live on the planet. Yes, bigger than dinosaurs. Today, there are beaked whales and narwhal whales with unicorn-like horns (the horn is actually a giant tooth) because evolution is awesome and really, really strange. Pyenson extensively describes the feeding habits of the two types of whales (baleen and toothed), especially how baleen whales gulp in huge volumes of water and food, then strain the water out through their sieve of baleen. He and colleagues discovered a gelatinous sensory organ inside the whale jaw attached to tiny hairs on the outside of the chin (like cat whiskers!), which help whales detect fish or krill nearby. Honestly, I was less interested in baleen feeding methodology or anatomy than the brief descriptions of whales working together to capture fish by creating bubble “nets” or killer whales hunting in pods.
I caught sight of a tall dorsal fin that can belong only to an adult male killer whale knifing through the air. From far away, the elongate triangle was devoid of reflection, as if someone had cut a hole out of the sky. As the supreme predator of the oceans, their diet includes an entire species list of other marine predators: great white sharks, baleen whales, other dolphins, sea lions, squid...
The future section is the shortest and (to me) the weakest part of the book, speculating on how climate change, rising sea levels, and the impact of increasing CO2 on the aquatic food web may benefit some types of whales, while decimating others. Pyenson hypothesizes that whales able to survive in diverse environments and subsist on a broad-based diet are more likely to survive. Sadly, some species are already extinct a result of human actions like whaling, bycatch, building dams, and dumping mercury and other chemicals into rivers and oceans.The references to whale song, intelligence, and behavior were the highlights of the book for me. Pyenson notes that ocean dolphins (e.g., killer whales) have the largest brain to mass ratio (called the EQ) of any mammal except humans and baleen whales have an EQ very close to primates. For most of our planet’s history, dolphins were the brainiest creatures around! Dolphins are one of the few mammals to pass the mirror self-recognition test and toothed whales have such complex vocalizations and clicks that the mathematics of information theory seems to be one of the few ways to describe its content. And whales often sing together:
 Scientists had recently discovered that male humpbacks produce complex songs, composed of phrases collected under broader themes, nested like Russian dolls that repeat in a loop. Each new singer improvises on the loop…
This was a fascinating, well-written, and meticulously researched book. A few things prevented it from being five stars for me. I would have loved more information about whale behavior and fewer snide remarks about “whale huggers.” Pyenson is an incredible scientist, but not necessarily an animal lover. (The matter-of-fact descriptions of him dissecting whale heads on a ship in Iceland, with rivulets of blood underfoot and the carcass being turned into meat, made me a bit queasy.) As he explains, he is a scientist interested in Deep Time and whales are a means to answer his questions about evolution, but not a means to an end in themselves. He is absolutely entitled to this perspective, mine is just different. (And yes, I did have a stuffed whale as a child. So?)As another great author once said…so long, and thanks for all the fish."
13,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30325324-kirabobeera,3,"If I wanted an analytical and purely scientific examination of whales' history and evolution, I shouldn't have picked up this book. If I wanted an objective and comprehensive evaluation of scientific research, I shouldn't have picked up this book. Instead, you get a narrative of one scientist's traipse across the world and self-promoting research. Rather than a clear and impersonal account, you get a narcissistic, author-centric novel about his own grandiose work. Now, that isn't to say that Pyenson's research is diminutive in any way. A lot of the research that he has performed has been invaluable in understanding whales' evolutionary history and potential future trajectory. I was initially drawn to this book due to his prior research and contributions to the greater scientific cetacean community. However, the information within this book is just so focused on him rather than the whales that it becomes a bit difficult to get through. I emphasize the word ""narrative,"" as this is not the distanced writing of other familiar scientific authors. There is so much peripheral ""stuff"" that is about him, his family, his feelings, and his thoughts that it ultimately detracts from the overall science of the book.Pyenson's novel seems to rely centrally on himself and the work that he has done over the course of his career. Again, that isn't to imply that his research is unimportant or irrelevant—his work truly compromises the backbone of Spying on Whales and is a fundamental part of the underlying story. There are tiffs about driving over nighttime Central American highways, quips about his family's begrudging acceptance to let him foray for fossils on the beach, and nudges about how he's just so well-versed in his area of study (which is a given, as he is an expert paleontologist.) It comes off as self-centered and egotistical; a tone of voice that carries so much extra authority that it's just tiring.Narrative aside, the science and research is captivating. There is so much to be learned from whales, both present-day and long-extinct species. Removing the periphery of Pyenson's narration, you learn an incredible amount about how whales have evolved, why they evolved, and what it means for the future. Truly, the information contained within is striking, and I have never been so impressed with these incredible creatures.If you're willing to wade through the narrative, this book is certainly one to be taken seriously. Though the book is riddled with rhetorical and hypothetical questions (few of which are actually answered,) you will find yourself immersed in the Miocene oceans of early cetaceans and taken through the fossils collections of the Smithsonian. This is not a book that I would consider to be heavily scientific, but it does contain vital facets of scientific research, collaboration, and analysis. I am pleased to have read it, but am unlikely to pick it up again. Surely, there are those readers that would find the narrative effective in making the research more personal and relatable, but there are also those that would find it trite. Be sure to know which one you are."
14,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,4,"4 stars - It was great. I loved it. Did you know that whales used to walk on land before returning to the water?Oh the rabbit holes this book led me down….googled until my googler was sore. Easy to read (not dry at all) with fascinating tidbits. I love that the author makes you aware of what has been done by humans, along with what might happen due to humans (pros and cons), without being preachy or condescending. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: We sent whalesong into interstellar space because the creatures that sing these songs are superlative beings that fill us with awe, terror, and affection. We have hunted them for thousands of years and scratched them into our mythologies and iconography. Their bones frame the archways of medieval castles. They’re so compelling that we imagine aliens might find them interesting — or perhaps understand their otherworldly, ethereal song.First Sentence: At this very moment, two spacecraft move at over thirty-four thousand miles per hour, about ten billion miles away from us, each carrying a gold-plated copper record."
15,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,4,"This book was more than I imagined it would be. I've read plenty of books about whales (and loved pretty much all of them). But I've never read a book about whale fossils, which is largely what this book is about. Pyenson is a paleontologist and curator of fossil marine mammals for the Smithsonian. He's also a skilled and interesting storyteller, as evidenced by how little I wanted to put this book down once I started reading. There were a handful of words I had to look up (something I hope to be doing for as long as I'm reading; learning is my favorite part of reading), and some really fascinating (to me) exposition on how large whale fossils are excavated, studied, and preserved. This book isn't fluff, and it isn't whimsical, but it's full of beautiful stories about whales beautifully told. (It also has some seriously lovely black and white illustrations.)That scientists have been able to learn so much about the origins, past incarnations, and current machinations of whales from assorted bones and fossil fragments found all over the globe will never not be impressive. Perhaps the most memorable parts of this book for me are the chapters and pages centered on whaling, which are equal parts haunting and honest. I could write endless essays about how ridiculous, irresponsible, short-sighted, and self-serving it is that countries like Iceland, Norway, Japan are still whaling, but what's even more devastating is how many millions of whales were killed by men from all over the world in the 20th century alone: Three million whales gone. Species utterly decimated. Populations diminished to the brink of extinction, to the detriment of oceanic diversity and stability, and to the detriment of all of us. [Four stars for so many dogeared pages and notes in the margins, and for the relentless hope that if more people take the time to learn about these stunning and resilient leviathans we won't destroy them (and our oceans) before they have a chance to survive us.]"
16,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.Pyenson is clearly obsessed with whales — with the idea of them, with studying them, with understanding them and sharing that understanding. In this volume, he does his best to share all those things: his enthusiasm for whales as much as his academic interest, his wonder at them as much as his understanding of them as part of their environment. He tours through whales of the past through their fossils (so if you’re a palaeontology nut, this one’s for you too!), whales of the present through observation and dissection (so if you’re into biology…) and whales of the future through trying to understand how they impact their environment, and what the seas might be like without them.It’s a fascinating journey: whales aren’t one of the topics I read about obsessively, but I wasn’t going to pass up a book about them from the library, either. Pyenson’s style is breezy, and he manages to communicate wonder even about things that might sound kind of gross (like whale dissection). To my surprise, I think I was most fascinated by his chapter about the weird new sense organ he discovered in whales’ chins, via actually being there on a whaling station to see freshly killed whales being butchered. (He has mixed feelings about this, but correctly notes that sometimes, you have to use the opportunities you get.)I’m not raring to go dashing off to become an expert in matters marine, which is the sign of a non-fiction book that really gets to me, but nonetheless there’s plenty of interest here for the armchair enthusiast. If the idea of these massive mammals takes your breath away a little bit, this book might just augment that."

The image in the book (page 104) shows the walrus digging for mollusks using the left tusk. There was no date that I could find indicating what period these creatures existed. It mentioned on a page about walruses and krill, typical of the book jumping around in subject matter. The three groupings ""Past, Present and Future"" made little sense to me as in each chapter there were still references to the past and a hodge podge covering of the author's experiences.*Newsflash > Wikipedia says their temporal range was 7.2-3.6 mya and they are known from Peru and Chile."

If you are interested in whales as I am, this is a book you. In Spying on Whales: The Past, Present, and Future of Earth's Most Awesome Creatures, Nick Pyenson talked about the major evolution changes of whales by examining whale bones: how whales became aquatic mammals; how blue whale became the largest animal on earth; what does the future look like for whales in the Anthropocene. He also documented the major dig in Cerro Ballena in Chile where four layers of mass graves of whales bones were discovered."
19,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"I liked this one. I found the search on whales fascinating, especially a whale that can live over 200 years. I grew up in Alaska and I learned about the wildlife in and around that great state. I've seen whales in the far distance, but never up close until two years ago when I went up for a visit and we went out on Resurrection Bay. It was quite amazing. They are so large, playful and an awesome sight. The author did his own narration and he did a great job. You could hear his passion for what he does in his voice and that made this more enjoyable. So 4 stars."

I feel like the book I listened to is not the book advertised in the blurb. There's way too much background about the author. I don't care about him. I just wanted to learn about whales.

23,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nick Pyenson studies whales--all cetaceans, in fact. Whales include the largest animals that have ever lived on Earth. We've interacted with them for much of our history.But because they spend most of their lives underwater, and mostly don't have any regular need to be close to shore, we know surprisingly little about them. Which whales have the most oil or blubber is important for whale hunters, but not exactly a deep scientific insight, taken by itself. It doesn't tell us anything about how whales evolved, where they are and what they're doing in the great majority of their time that isn't spent anywhere near humans, or what their likely future in a changing world may be. Nick Pyenson has spent his professional life trying to answer those questions.This is the story of that research and what he and other scientists have learned.Pyenson reads his own book in a lively, enthusiastic, and clear voice that's easy to listen to. His passion for his subject comes through, and he's got really interesting material to work with.His first section is about the cetacean past--how whales arose from four-legged, somewhat dog-like land animals, by stages, from fully land-dwelling animals, to animals spending a lot of time in the water but still mostly land-dwelling, to water-dwelling animals who gave birth on land, to animals that still had vestigial legs which clearly could not have supported them on land, to the current variety of fully aquatic whales and dolphins. A significant part of this research involves a fossil bed in Chile that has the largest and most complete fossil remains of extinct species of whales, deposited in at least four separate episodes, possibly due to toxic algal blooms (i.e., ""red tide."") One of the small, interesting details from this section is that whales' closest living relatives appear to be hippos.The second section is about currently living whale species, what we know and don't know, and how we are still learning the basics of internal whale anatomy and the differences to be found in the different varieties of whales. This includes discovery of previously unsuspected structures in the jaws and chins of different varieties of filter-feeding whales. Gathering some of this data included reluctantly joining a whaling expedition, not something he was pleased to do, but a rare opportunity to examine internal anatomical details on whales that haven't already begun to decay.The final section considers the possible future of cetacean species in a changing global environment--which species are recovering from past depredations and which aren't, which seem to be adapting to the changes we're living through now, and which seem to be struggling, or losing the battle. There are some very impressive successes.All in all, it's both a fascinating book, and a good listen.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
24,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,4,"With a glut of science books focused on humans’ curiosity with the animal world, I am in awe. The ocean is just one big ball is amazingness that has yet to really be explored because it tests our limits, so it wasn’t hard to read this book when a Smithsonian scientist wanted to talk whales. And the title just was icing on the cake. Yes, that’s all humans are really doing- spying. Because we can’t do anything else at those depths and with our technology. But we sure as heck are leading them to extinction and that pisses me off. Then you become mesmerized by factoids like whales are being clocked in at 200 years old based on eyeballs, ovary scars, and teeth. There was quite a bit about there history and specifically excavation of bones at a few particularly rich locations in the world and while he was fantastic at telling the story, it was less interesting than discussing the present that we’re living in for obvious reasons. He spoke to several of the species and to their awesome features. I could read on and on. When I finished I wanted to fall down the rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos of whales but surprisingly there are not many. A few clips for National Geographic, some amateur video from whales emerging from the water in front of a boat, but not much else to be awestruck by (though there are several LONG videos claiming to have on repeat whale sounds for mediation and sleeping) and that just adds to their mysteriousness. Kudos to our author for bringing his A game to share with couch scientists everywhere about whales because I was completely sucked in! (wink wink for a poor joke about our lunge eaters!)"
25,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65436618-sophy-h,3,"If you like whales, and paleontology, you'll probably like this book some! Pyenson uses archaeological and paleontological evidence to back up observations made in the field about whales, from feeding habits, to sleeping positions to singing across miles of ocean!The issue I have with the book (which I find with quite a few nature writers actually), is the acceptance and almost indifferent attitiude towards the ongoing brutal practice of whaling; so much so that Pyenson and his colleagues ""borrow"" bits of whale bodies that have been hacked from those poor creatures that have been brutally harpooned from the ocean! Surely a better stance from the scientific community would be to completely condemn whaling, as opposed to ""well, lets not let a whale corpse go to waste, give us its skull""!! He even admits to decimation of whale numbers over the years, and extinction of certain river dolphin species. So campaign against it then from the safety of your Smithsonian office, instead of going out on whaling boats (!!!) and collecting more specimens to squirrel away in a museum back room!! Eugh it makes me mad that some scientists seem quietly resigned to and almost complicit in the further slaughtering of ancient, intelligent, and truly amazing animals. "
26,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13007397-shelley,3,"Maybe a 3.5, but this book teetered between more exciting descriptions of expeditions the author had been on to sections which were pretty dry and academic. If you are interested in whales, especially Orca, read Carl Safina's books. His intensity and beautiful writing made this book suffer by comparison IMHO.When I first started the book I saw the three main sections, past, present, and future and thought this would be organized as such, but it seemed to skip around. Given that Pyenson is a Paleontologist, I thought the first part would be his wheelhouse and I'd hear the enthusiasm, but it builds then drops off. If he could have written more with the passion I saw in his discussion of discovering the sensory organ in the whale's chin in Iceland (pg. 154) I'd have rated much higher."

30,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,4,"An interesting book but somewhat disjointed. Good stories with new information about whales but too much paleontology. Along the way, we learn even more about the impact of climate change. Studying the largest organism means thinking about the limits of biology and what whales need to do to maintain their big bodies, writes Nick Pyenson, the curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. As enigmatic creatures, whales defy many tools to measure them. They travel through vast oceans, dive to dark depths and can live twice as long as humans. Scientists tag whales with a smartphone-sized monitor, which gives scientists a remote view into their lives. Whales seem otherworldly by combining a mammal heritage with size, power and intelligence. Yet these benign giants pose no threat to us, writes Pyenson. They live as approachable and sophisticated. The oldest fossils comes from forty-five million years ago of dog-sized land-dwelling four-legged ur-whales. Eighty species survive but six hundred others went extinct. Only thirty years ago, DNA revealed hippos as the closest living relatives to whales. And just eighteen years ago, paleontologists discovered a unique anklebone that placed whale ancestors with cows, goats and camels. The biomass of a blue whale ranks as the most massive animal in the history of life, weighing well over a hundred tons, more than the biggest dinosaurs. When we chart the ratio of brain to body size, we learn that ocean dolphins plot higher than every animal except for us. And before we came along, they were the brainiest for ten million years. Whales engage in conversation. But they live in a world foreign to us, making it difficult to decipher the clicks, chirps, squeaks and songs. The best evidence for culture in whales comes from their acoustic behavior. Sperm whales live in long-distance acoustic clans that expand this phenomenon to the scale of ocean basins with thousands of members over thousands of miles. Whale poop matters to the ocean ecosystem on a significant scale. That poop brings tons of nutrients to the surface from deep below. Part three of the book muses about the future of whales. Whales and humans began interacting thousands of years ago. But only in the past few hundred years did the encounters affect whale destiny. Simpler threats in the recent past included ship strikes, fishing gear entanglement and pollution. But now climate change represents the greatest human impact of all. Climate change warms the poles faster than anywhere else. So measuring and monitoring humpbacks in the Antarctic becomes more critical every year. The Arctic is warming fastest of all, and it may become free of sea ice in twenty years. A warmer Arctic with less ice allows for more shipping, which leads to collisions with whales. A warmer Arctic also creates an ecological niche for invading species, such as Orca. A couple dozen linocut and scratchboard illustrations decorate the text. Thirty-seven pages of well-annotated notes support the story. My favorite note: “The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance. It is the illusion of knowledge,” by Daniel Boorstin of The Washington Post, who wrote that in an article years ago titled The Six O’clock Scholar. That endnote supported Pyenson’s comment in the text when he learned something new about a whale chin: “So goes discovery. Unless you know your own ignorance, you won’t recognize when something truly novel is right before your eyes.” Bookplate: “Presented to the Milwaukee Public Library for the Citizens of Milwaukee from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.” Thanks! Whales intrigued me for over fifty years. I read books about them, collected whale music and hung a whale mobile in my bedroom. I dreamed of opening a restaurant called The Blue Whale, featuring the blues. Customers would walk in through the jaws of a life-size blue whale. I moved here from Monterey County, California, in my first Honda Civic bearing a license plate, which friends still remember, that read CETACEA."
31,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7410827-allen-adams,4,"http://www.themaineedge.com/tekk/spyi...Writing about science in a manner that is entertaining and accessible while also conveying the desired information with clarity and concision – not an easy task by any means. Finding the proper balance of wonky jargon and narrative engagement requires a backwards-and-forwards depth of knowledge about the subject matter AND significant storytelling acumen. It’s a shot at harmony while dodging discord.In short, there’s a real art to science writing.Nick Pyenson’s new book “Spying on Whales: The Past, Present, and Future of Earth’s Most Awesome Creatures” is a prime example of getting it right. Pyenson is unabashedly wonky for long stretches (though he does come by it honestly - he’s Curator of Fossil Marine Mammals at the Smithsonian and a noted paleobiologist), but he also allows his personal passion for the work shine through. True passion is infectious, and that’s what he brings to the table – the reader can’t help but be drawn along.The book’s format is precisely what its subtitle tells you it is. “Spying on Whales” comes in three parts, each section an exploration of the past, present or future of the largest creatures on Earth.In Part I, we get a good look at Pyenson’s work with fossils. We pay a visit to an unexpected treasure trove of ancient whale bones discovered in Chile and watch as he’s forced to rely on unconventional solutions to ensure the future educational possibilities of the site. We follow him deep into the nooks and crannies of the Smithsonian, learning about the multitude of whale artifacts therein. We even get a couple of deep dives (pun intended) into how whales have come to be and how they’ve impacted the ecosystems in which they exist over the millennia.With Part II, Pyenson gives us a closer examination of whales as they are today. These whales are true giants of the seas; the biggest of them are arguably the largest creatures to ever exist on this planet. Seriously – the largest recorded blue whale is basically the same size as the largest of the dinosaurs. And so many others are also gigantic, so big as to beg questions with regards to the logistics of their existence. We also spend time with Pyenson at an Icelandic whaling operation where he and his team are able to explore whale biology in ways that hadn’t been done in years if at all.As for Part III, we get a glimpse at some of Pyerson’s thoughts about the future of whales. With the changing nature of the climate, there are some ecological shifts that impact whale life (some positively, others negatively). The population devastation wrought by the relentless overkill of the whaling industry’s peak has some major consequences for species viability going forward as well. The seas were once teeming with whales, but mankind’s interference – filling the seas with noise and trash and carbon dioxide – may ensure that such a day never returns.Full disclosure: were it not for my job, I might well never have picked up “Spying on Whales” in the first place. While I have my affection for science-oriented nonfiction, I can’t say that I’d ever given whales much thought. And there are plenty of other new books out there to review. Yet this is the one I started to read.And I’m truly glad I did.What “Spying on Whales” does so beautifully is convey the seemingly boundless passion of a scientist in a way that is true to his work without sacrificing accessibility. Despite the fact that Pyenson does get a little wonky at times, the book continues to engage. The specifics and minutiae being shared are a delight, but even if they’re a bit too much, their presence never impacts a more general understanding.Anyone who has spent even a little time thinking about it is aware that whales are fascinating creatures, but what books like this one do is shine a light on that fascination. Pyenson loves them and loves learning about them … and wants the reader to love it too. Academic joy is weird and niche, but it’s also pure and entertaining as heck.“Spying on Whales” is prime science writing, a distillation of a subject that is neither condescending nor exclusive. It’s a lovely piece of nonfiction, one that educates and entertains. Lovers of science – especially biology – will adore it, but even absent those interests, a reader possessed of simple natural curiosity might well find themselves diving deep."
32,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19914325-samantha-trillium,3,"I think the title misled me a bit with this one. I thought I was getting a book about someone who spent a lot of time observing whales in their natural habitat and would give us a run down on what we know what theorize about these creatures. While we did get a bit of that here, there was much more emphasis on the actual bones and carcasses of the whales and what that can tell us about them as a species, how the managed to evolve into living in the water and so on. Fascinating to be sure, but not really what I wanted to read. "
33,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1509047-linden,5,"Pyenson is a paleontologist and gives us a long look at the past starting almost 52 million years ago with the Pakicetus, about the size of a large domestic dog having four weight-bearing legs. He, Pyenson, talks about the known but extinct evolutionary stages, continues following their descendants through the decimations of the whaling era, and brings them into the present. He also writes about their future with a focus on qualities of the whales that may be expected to survive the current climate change and those that will likely not. Interestingly, the entire book is not told in a linear fashion, though chronology is going on, but through anecdotal stories, both historical and his own, mixed with the science behind them. He does this in a fashion that is hard to put down because each sets up what is to follow. Some of the many things I learned: * Whales have countable pregnancy scars on their ovaries. (p. 189)* Their mammalian hearts have four chambers; the largest whales have hearts the size of tractor tires. (p. 145)* In 1992, a 51' female bowhead was killed and was discovered to have a stone-headed harpoon embedded in her shoulder. Alaskan whalers stopped using them by 1880; her age was found to be about 133 years. (p. 190)* The lenses in whales eyes age somewhat like those of humans. In 1995, one killed and analyzed was found to be 211 years old, possibly born during the time of Lewis and Clark expedition. (p. 191)* Whales have culture. (p. 236-37)* Likely two kinds of cetaceans have a sense of self, meaning they can recognize themselves in a mirror. Along with us, the great apes and Asian elephants, so too do bottlenose dolphins and possibly killer whales. (p. 233-34)* Most fascinating: the physics and process in lunge feeding by rorquals and the timeline marking when whales started to become gigantic.This is one of the best non-fiction books I've read a a long time. I even found additional interesting information in the 38 pages of footnotes! In fact, Spying on Whales is one I know I'll continue to reread. Mind of the Raven by Bernd Heinrich is in the same category. I read it once from the public library and then twice from one I purchased before sending it on to my granddaughter. One of the deciding factors for me is that both share a more complex pattern than most linear non-fiction books. While a timeline makes for understandable and orderly content, somehow following the development of a reader's comprehension of any aspect of the topic, especially with the experiments and studies that lift that understanding to a new level, offers a classy and almost endlessly appealing experience to me."

No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted.At the heart of this book is the young man, the boy, whose curiosity led him to become a paleobiologist. Dr. Pyenson tells the story of whales with a childlike enthusiasm that sees the best in colleagues, endures the tough physical challenges as well as the rigorous academics involved in his position, and what seems like an endless amount of passion for passing knowledge and understanding on to people of all scientific abilities, including me.Despite its math and methods science is still a human endeavor, and it requires heart and passion to reach us. Pyenson offers facts and information but more importantly his writing and narration are relatable and his personality is friendly. He tells a story.I saw my first whale while I was listening to the book, off the Massachusetts beach where we spend a lot of time. Although it wasn’t bigger than a bus, it was as large as many of the fishing boats in the water. It was certainly the biggest animal I had ever seen in the water. We saw whales several times this past week including a breaching. I know more about the whale species than I did before I read the book, but, be advised that like many natural science books it can be hard to understand certain words. One term I found I had completely misunderstood as “Roark Whale” is really “Rorqual Whale.” But it also seems likely that the whale, or whales we saw were humpback or minke whales. I also found the colorful descriptions of how whale research is done fascinating: deserts, freezing seas, rocky roads, cliffs under tides all but once a year. It is often dangerous, most assuredly uncomfortable and dirty work. As a paleobiologist it is curious how important Pyenson’s work is to understanding how this species fares today: how it was and is affected by hunting, pollution and climate change. He offers facts, theoryPyenson, is brilliant, and he has a pleasant voice for delivering his words in audio format. His ability to personalize his work, tells the story of the whale and the story of science. "
35,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,4,"This is a good science book. It focuses on a few of the author's discoveries. For example, with collaborators, he worked on a massive whale graveyard in Chile, where dozens of rare complete skeletons were found, having been laid down in four different events—thought to be victims of poisonous algal blooms. He goes to Iceland and works in a whaling factory, where before the whales are stripped down he discovers a sac of nerves in the tip of the rorqual chin—thought to be important in opening the jaws for feeding. There are a fair number of interesting whale facts, but the book is not overly dense. Like good science it focuses more on the process of discovery, and on how we know what we know. There are vignettes of a scientist's life, some history of whales, whaling and the Smithsonian, lots of whale prehistory, and some speculation on the future (e.g., gray whales moving from the Pacific to the Atlantic [where they went extinct maybe 400 years ago, for unknown reasons], or orca populations with different food sources, like those specializing in salmon, diverging into separate species). The book is quite short. It is occasionally overwritten—a lot of sentences and paragraphs could be tightened up—but not badly so. "
36,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5488536-anna,5,"Won from a Goodreads' giveawayI've seen that many people didn't care for this book as much as they expected, because it tends to wander off of the straight and narrow path of being all about whales, and I can agree with that point. The author does give us a look into the work he does, both in the Smithsonian and out in the field, his personal thoughts, the discoveries he has been part of, etc. Honestly...I loved that. His descriptions of the places and events that happened pulled me into that very moment. For example, I recall feeling excitement as he described one of the finds, and understanding his feelings of conflict over whaling. I guess you could say I enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes view of whale research too. But yes, you will still learn about the past, present, and probable future of whales in this book. I wasn't completely ignorant on the topic of whales before this, but I can certainly say I added a lot more information to the section of my brain dedicated to these beauties courtesy of this book. So if you want to learn about whales, but also wouldn't mind learning about the research and hard work that goes into bringing you that information, I think you should give this a shot."
37,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85581563-ec2151,4,"Be aware that the book is mostly interested in facets of whale biology and fossilized whale bones. Vignettes and anecdotes about discovering whale fossils etc. fill out the tract. There is time given to discussing the process of tagging whales, how whales evolved to meet various different environmental challenges, and a final section on how whales can survive (or not) in the modern age.The text is rendered in a readable and approachable format. The narrator, Pyenson, comes off as affable and willing to lead you through the subject despite being outside of anyone's purview (unless the person reading this review is also a student of the evolutionary history of whales). The book is in equal parts in awe of and a clinical examination of whales, and how they have managed to thrive on this planet for so long.Recommended from the perspective of someone with an amateur interest in marine biology."
38,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19965907-natalie-k,5,"This book is SO good! I have always been interested in whales and paleontologist Nick Pyenson definitely has a deep and abiding love for them that comes through in this book. He divides the book into three sections—past, present, and future—and writes eloquently about whales. Ancient whales that were fossilized, whales whose populations were decimated by whaling, and what the future may bring for whales in a world populated by more and more humans.I think the most fascinating thing I read was about the lifespan of bowhead whales. Pyenson demonstrates through scientific investigation that these massive creatures can live for over 200 years! They live in the Arctic and were hunted back when whaling was still legal (or rather, practiced a lot more than it is now).This book is not to be missed. If you don't like whales already, you will by the time you finish reading it!!!"
39,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5693583-james-jd-dittes,4,"Pyenson here synthesizes a number of areas of science: evolutionary biology, marine biology, paleontology, and physiology to name a few.And what creature could inspire such a wide-ranging look into Nature's past, present, and future? It would have to be the whale.Pyenson takes the reader along to a road cut in Chile, where we learn about prehistoric whales and geologic changes to the Pacific coast of South America. My favorite chapter found him and a friend at a whaling station in Iceland, where their dissections of rendered whales led to understanding of the physics and physiology of how finback whales take in huge gulps of water to capture prey.I don't come to Pyenson from a scientific background, but more from a literary one, having taught Moby Dick for many years. Still, I found his insights fascinating and his passion for cetacians to be contagious."
40,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5025818-edward-canade,4,"I liked it. I like whales and I felt like I learned some about their evolution, habits and and the effects of whaling and climate change on their chances for survival. Nick Pension intentionally wrote in a style any layperson can understand. The author shares his personal experiences in his quest to learn about whales from direct interactions with both living and fossils of Cetaceans. Not only are some whales the largest beings to ever roam the earth, but some also can live to 200 plus years. (Now don't go telling me about clams or sponges, or mushrooms being bigger or living longer.) So if you are looking for a primer on whales, this might just be a good book to start with."

It may be the fact that it was the audio version I listened to and I would have enjoyed it more in written form but I listen to audio all the time without an issue. There was some interesting information about whales in there, however the way it’s presented is just too blah and I missed a lot of it during my mind’s wandering. Be prepared for lots and lots of talk about the fossil record and the author’s work in this area. Although the author is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, it’s presentation just didn’t work for me."
42,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72716572-dustin-rottier,4,"Won this book in a Goodreads giveaway from Viking books. This is a relatively quick, easy read packed with scientific data and anecdotes. Author is a paleontologist and rightfully includes his expertise to help explain the natural history of whales and highlight many of the questions still not 100% understood about these marine giants. I love that the author shows how a scientist works through a problem through what may be taught as the scientific method."
43,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40496763-elise,4,"I listened to this book and though there were some spots that were a little hard to follow, it was still very interesting. In the last chapter the author brought out some fascinating facts: For instance, a right whale was found around the beginning of the 21st century with a nineteenth century harpoon head in it. That would have made this whale over 150 years old.Definitely worth the read (or listen)."
44,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26377616-becky-stanley,3,"Lots of information about whale evolution, although it was a little dry for my taste. I was hoping to learn more about behaviors and family structure so I had expectations going into this book which probably colored my experience a bit. I definitely walked away with some new information, though!I received a free copy of this book in a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for my honest review."
45,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10036370-lauren,4,This book was totally different from what I was expecting but not in a bad way. It covers the evolutionary history of whales and also covers some of their unique anatomical features. It was interesting learning about them through a paleontologist vs biologist. I also enjoyed the last section which was on the future of whales. Hopefully they will continue to rebound. 
46,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,4,"A paleontologist explores what we know of the past and what it might mean in the future for whales. There wasn’t quite as much about the day to day life of current whales as I expected, but I really enjoyed learning more about how whales evolved and how much we still don’t know about their lives."
47,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10785156-caitlin,4,"Fascinating, easy read about these majestic animals. I found the evolutionary history and the author’s guesses as to where the different species of whales may lead to be the most interesting aspects of the book. Worth the read. "
48,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43081076-jedioffsidetrap,5,"Fascinating, comprehensive & fun. The paleontology angle was new to me and added depth (pun intended ;-)) to the subject. The bit on dissecting whales at a whaling station in Iceland was especially fascinating! "
49,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57238300-tia,5,"Loved it. Huge plus for the pictures, although I would have liked more. I am not familiar enough with cetacean anatomy to understand how their jaws work, for example. Then again, I learned a lot, including the word ""cetacean"". So definitely 5/5."
50,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33132537-melissa-mcguire,4,Since i was little I always was so intrigued about whales. This book lived up to what I was expecting and I learned quite a fee new things.
51,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29710590-debbie,3,I finished reading “Spying on Whales” by Nick Pyeson. I found it to be an informative book on everything whales. I learned quite a few new things about whales. Beautiful animals!
52,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1681381-awallens,2,This book was very dry in places and I found the writing a bit scattered going from one thing to another. I wish it had been a little more linear.
53,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34599782-dre-mcdermott,3,This was very encyclopedia-ish and full of really fascinating information. I was hoping for more of a narrative but still incredibly readable for this genre. 
54,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84745651-alyssa-swink,4,"DNF. Very interesting, but I need to be in a different state of mind to read it. Hopefully I can finish it in the future."
55,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/696679-mark-fallon,4,"The majestic beauty of whales has always captivated me. Pyenson weaves the story of whales' evolution, hunting and future in a way that makes me want to learn even more."
56,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44043450-riley-jackson,5,"If you like natural history, marine life, or just a great story, this book is amazing. The author has such a unique perspective that he communicates very well and it is worth a read! "
57,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/528278-bridget,4,"So many whale facts! I'd say this was maybe a 3.5 star read for me, but I haven't looked at the book yet to see the art, and I am very curious about that."
58,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21336711-katie-lucas,2,"Some interesting anecdotes, but I was hoping for more insight into living whales' behavior, and less info on anatomical structure of whale skulls (!)"
59,0735224560,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"I grew up very close to Mystic, Connecticut, a historic 19th century whaling port. It’s a sad association, though I was fascinated with its history, and the whaling ship Charles W. Morgan moored at the museum. As I grew more aware in my teen years (do note, long before an internet), the horror of what humans did in decimating whale populations scarred my intellect forever. This book speaks to my heart. And at times, tears it. Especially when Pyenson shared how old whales can live and the age at death of two that were killed (spoiler that I'll save for the end...)Pyenson is a paleontologist and breaks his book into three obvious parts: Past, Present and Future. I've read a bit on paleontology and fossils over the past 48 or so years, but not much on whale fossils and whale evolution. I think better than other authors I've read, Pyenson explains the forensics and deduction in piecing together fossils, identifying common species characteristics and new species. He talks about some fascinating techniques in scanning and 3D printing of fossils so that paleontologists can manipulate and study skeletons without damaging the real fossils. As with much of the fossil record, there are large gaps, but that there are whale fossils at all is fascinating. Pyenson talks a bit on different extinct families of whale ancestors.Modern telemetric tagging with special suction cups yields tremendous data on movements, feeding, and so much more. Scientists learned that Cuvier's beaked whales can dive to an astonishing 2,992 meters while holding breaths for more than 137 minutes while foraging for squid and fish. While whaling is abhorrent to any rational human, it is still a fact in places like Iceland, though with severe restrictions compared to early twentieth century butchery. And as it is a fact, scientists use the opportunity to access anatomical data they otherwise would not be able to have. and the data reveal some answers to the evolution of echolocation, baleen, gigantism and more. And as for intelligence, When we chart the ration of brain size to body size - a metric called the encephalization quotient, or EQ— we have a way of quantifying the fact that dolphins are indeed very brainy. While baleen whales and river dolphins plot closer to primates, oceanic dolphins— including killer whales— plot higher than every other mammal except us, slotting in second behind humans, but ahead of chimpanzees.Hunting methods and social behavior emphasize a degree of intelligence, and many species have exhibited deliberate culture passed on not through genetics, but (and Pyenson doesn't use this term) through memetics.Whale depletion forced killer whales to change their feeding from larger whales to walruses and seals, and then down to sea otters. As Pyenson notes ""[l]iving at the top of the food web for decades alson means continual exposure to and concentration of any persistent poisons in your diet."" Kile whales have ""some of the most contaminated tissue of any mammal on the planet, carrying high loads of chemicals such as flame retardants and complex organic molecules, which resist rapid decomposition."" We did that. And few people know of it.On the future, with the limits on whale hunting, many species populations have increased, and some, while no longer on an endangered list, have only stabilized. One rare positive effect of anthropogenic global warming might be that, barring human predation, some whales might thrive more as the food columns of the Arctic might bloom do to the increased heat of the ocean. The slaughter of millions of whales in the early twentieth century had devastating effects not only on whale populations but huge oceanic ecosystems. ""Whale poop"" feeds the lowest tiers of phyto- and zooplankton, which are significant for Of course, the carbon dioxide levels in the oceans will increase its acidity, which will have far more far-reaching detrimental effects, but for a brief period, maybe some whale species might rebound further. The toxins in those orcas would probably increase to deadly levels, so the positives are few.On the book itself, the notes section is nearly as long as the main text - and in that form I really dislike: no reference in the text; a leading sentence fragment of the paragraph supported. I guess I am too old school; I want to know when a cite is made so I can choose to follow it. I so much dislike stumbling across them at the end, with only a tacit connection to what I read. I do not want to go back after I’m done. Even for books as good as this. I understand the purpose of not interrupting a flow, but it does a grave disservice to anyone actually thinking about what the author is writing. End notes, at least. Please.Something about huge mammals, I guess - I also love elephants. I’ve been on whale watching tours, but have only seen their smaller cousins (which are still whales). Someday. Sigh.Now ...SPOILER ... in 1992 a fifty-one-foot-long female bowhead whale was killed off Barrow. Once the blubber was stripped, scientists discovered an old injury in the shoulder and investigating further, discovered a stone harpoon lodged deep in the bowhead's body. Stone harpoons were last used in the 1880s. Considering that the whale must have been relatively mature at the time to survive such a strike, Craig [George] and his colleagues surmised that the whale, labeled 92B2, was at a minimum about 130 years old. When they later counted the pregnancy scars on her ovaries, the age that they calculated was completely consistent with a healed wound from the nineteenth century: 133.Here was a whale that had survived more than 130 years! But wait! There's more! Analyzing eye lenses for certain proteins that change over time at a consistent and known rate, but unlike other cells in the body, are not replaced over time, that same Craig George dated a 48 foot male killed in 1995 to be...211 years old. Here was a whale, older than the Constitution, tragically killed. A majestic creature, the longest lived mammal know, killed for I presume food. I am still stunned to learn how old they can live."
