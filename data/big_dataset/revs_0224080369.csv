No problem. He's a good writer and his analogies are interesting even if they're ones I've heard a hundred times. You know, like the one about Einstein on a Train. Raindrops on a tarmac for mass distributions of black holes and the eventual release of their captured radiation over a grand long time until entropy has its final way.Where the good stuff is, (in my opinion,) lies in the idea of time and its reversibility in the grand 10 to the 124 schema, or if we eventually throw this whole universe down a gravitational funnel, the 10 to the 125 manifold. Is this the reversal, the homogenous transformation of matter back into straight energy that preceded the original big bang? Is this an ongoing cycle that repeats?Well, that was what *I* wanted to know, anyway. Let me let you in on a big spoiler: (view spoiler)[We still don't know. (hide spoiler)]Honestly, this is good, even with all the talk about the lambda, Einstein's cosmological constant, and how it still maintains a strong presence in the grand discussion, but really? I truly have a much better time trying to wrap my puny little brain around the string theories more. Holographic universes also float my boat. Still, for all that this text tried to convince me of an old theory that may or may not be quite up to date, it's still a fun read.Maybe one of these days I'll do more than just nod my head at some of the more complex equations. :) Truly, enough exposure to these, book after book, IS doing me a lot of good. Maybe if I collect enough great analogies and get a spinal shunt with a couple hundred external parallel processors to hang my brain on, I'll be just about ready to transform a few tensors. :)"

Unfortunately, the evidence to date is far from compelling. But, even if it isn't correct, Penrose is asking such interesting questions that the book is absolutely worth reading.So here's my understanding of what it's about. Penrose starts by explaining the basic puzzle, which was a key theme in The Road to Reality and has been tantalizing cosmologists in general for a good while. As everyone knows who was paying attention during high school physics, the Second Law of Thermodynamics says that entropy increases with time; the universe gets progressively more and more disordered. If you drop an egg off a table, it breaks. But the time-reverse of this process is so vanishingly improbable that you don't ever expect to see it happen. A mess of egg-white, yolk and shell will not magically reassemble itself into an intact egg and then bound off the floor onto a table.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"

I took a tea break walked in a circle, picked back up the book and continued to stare at it trying to glean somehow the information that I obviously was not meant to be clever enough to follow. I felt like Zoolander beating up the computer to get the information out of it. I can honestly admit that I could not understand nor have any basis for figuring out the vast majority of this book. I tried. I am not stupid. I know basic physics. This is not basic. The math is way in another universe from my limited calculus background. I really tried, and I kept trying because I think the idea is flawless. I love a cyclic universe. I want a cyclic universe and frankly I don't want just anyone, I want this one. It is beautiful and well conceived. I just can't honestly say I understood the building up of it from the mathematical viewpoint. I got lost three equations in. The IDEAS that are here I love. I just can't make any comment on the checking out of these ideas at this time in my life. Luckily I bought the book, and I plan on living a while longer, maybe I will eventually get enough background to re tackle this one. "

It's definitely not the general population.You need some serious background in physics and mathematics to even start to understand what he's on about. So much so that you probably don't need to read the book, you could just read a summary of the argument and understand it.I usually don't mind skim-reading the deeply technical parts and I can still appreciate a book where the author tells you what it all means in plain english. But that just never happens.There wasn't even a conclusion that I could discern.

6,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,2,"Cycles of Time is Roger Penrose's attempt at (mostly) fleshing out his hypothesis of conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC), which is along the lines of previous cyclical cosmology proposals, suggesting that the current universe is merely a conformal (""smooth"") geometric extension of universes past.Penrose's prologue and epilogue in Cycles of Time are somewhat silly but presuppose the book's narrative. Penrose begins with the problems of the second law of thermodynamics in modern physics, specifically the role of entropy, which he accurately characterizes (though not explicitly) as microscopic degrees of freedom.This raises the question of how highly dense, highly heated, low-entropy pre-big bang conditions can result in a universe that is getting hotter and whose entropy is increasing, irreversibly. Penrose does not explain how his CCC model shows the transition (or ""crossover"") from the previous universe (""aeon"") to the present universe in terms of the dynamics that take place during this transition. Specifically, Penrose does not explaining how, nearing the end of the universe (some 10^100 years), a low-density, low-heat, radiation-dense universe with decreased phase space (and thus decreased degrees of freedom) gives rise to a new big bang. (The radiation, Penrose assumes, arises from massive particles eventually becoming massless and turning into electromagnetic radiation, or photons). CCC views the state of the universe in classical terms. Penrose dismisses modern cosmological models distinguished from CCC, such as string theory and loop quantum cosmology. CCC dismisses the necessity of discovering the nitty-gritty physics of space-time singularities in classical general relativity. In Penrose's view, non-classical (quantum) physics must be introduced at the Planck scale, which is the scale at which singularities must be dealt in order to avoid the problem, among many others, of infinite curvature. But Penrose dismisses the notion of infinity and the necessity of discovering new physics to explain spacetime singularities. Rather than working to explain them, we should merely walk around them.Penrose's CCC relies heavily on local conformity within Riemannian differential geometry. The mathematics he presents is not difficult to follow; he barely shows any math, save for his work in the appendices. Nevertheless, it is crucial for the reader to follow ith his definitions and to keep a reference of his notes, because they help to clarify or expound certain points.Penrose goes from a dab of statistical physics at the beginning of the book to general relativity. His arguments for CCC against other cosmological models with the aid of general relativity are relatively easy to follow, but he doesn't actually mention any dynamics of how transitions occur. Many of his explanations in these manners are hand-wavy.Cycles of Time is worth picking up, and although a narrative is present, it doesn't bring tie everything together very neatly, because it doesn't answer every question it poses. Chapter 1 poses great questions, and Penrose's attention to detail with how entropy operates in our universe is very refreshing. In addition, Chapter 2 is wonderful crash-course in special and general relativity. Chapter 3, however, leaves much to be desired. Overall, CCC deserves a formal exposition so as to cover as many loose ends as possible to a specific audience. Penrose should have added another chapter devoted to explaining how CCC, in conjunction with other cherry-picked GR cosmological models, might work during crossover, and not just how it works or looks geometrically."

8,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33219649-hal-taylor,5,"The explanation of what happens before the big bang is laid out nicely in Roger Penrose’s book “Cycles of Time”. This book, like all Penrose, is not for wimps but at least this time he puts the Riemann geometry and manifold calculus in the appendix. According to Penrose the big bang is merely the remnants of the previous Universe which at the end of time has been cleansed of all its matter by black holes and Hawking radiation. As the boundaries of any Universe approach infinity space-time is re-scaled by a factor K as matter disappears (S=KT). When all the black holes have evaporated and there is nothing left but circulating electromagnetic radiation K approaches zero. The fascinating logic behind this is that time cannot exist without a means to measure it or be aware of it. And since photons do not experience time (they travel on the surface of the light cone after all) there’s nothing left to experience time and space so it shrinks down to the point where all the energy of the Universe now in the form of photons and background radiation can no longer be confined and a big bang occurs.A personal note to Roger Penrose:Dear Sir: You finally gave me an answer for what really happens at the end of time. The notion that all the space and mass in the universe can shrink down to a microscopic point to begin anew with another Big Bang was so counter-intuitive that I, like most laymen listening to TV cosmologists on public television, was not convinced that this could happen in real life. But then I read your book “Cycles of Time”. At last someone has laid out a physical and mathematical rationale for what happens to all that space and mass. The idea of putting your friend Steven Hawking’s discovery of black hole radiation to work was brilliant. As black holes vacuum up all the mass in the universe and the boundaries of the Universe approach infinity space-time gets re-scaled by the scaling factor K. S = K T. I was even able to conceptualize the Big Bang event in my own original way by observing that since time is defined as the interval between events then when time ceases to exist all events occur at once making all the left over energy in the Universe, now just in the form of circulating electromagnetic radiation, do an instantaneous flash-bang. In fact I would be flattered if you used that idea in your next book. Yep. I got it all figured out now, Dr. Penrose. Thank you.Hal Taylor"
9,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,3,Picked this off the 'in' shelf at the library. I can see from the date stamps that loads of people have been reading this.... Technically it lost me very soon. While I have previously encountered null cones and think I get the drift - I have also previously encountered strict conformal diagrams - and they are still complete mysteries. Maybe next time. Because that is what I love - I might not understand very much but each time I read a book like this I do understand a little more. And I just love to know that so many people are borrowing this book!

It is not as technical as a scientific paper, but it is way more technical than a popular science book. Roger Penrose is clearly much more comfortable with linear algebra and tensor calculus than this reader."

I will re-read it soon because of some parts I didn't understand very well.Probably I would like to see more concepts explained in the appendices, that's it."
12,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91446276-frans-robyns,4,"I'm not going to lie, I really struggled to get through this book. Not because of the mathematical complexity (he helpfully banishes the complex equations to the Appendices to avoid confusing laymen such as myself) but because the ideas that he expresses in this book are so fundamentally non-intuitive. I had to take several breaks from the book to try and digest what I had understood from the text, often returning to it only to discover that what I thought he was trying to say was almost the complete opposite of what he was saying. Nevertheless, perseverance eventually paid off and I was able to comprehend (mostly) a genuinely new theory about the nature and history of our universe, one of the most beguiling and fundamental questions we can ask.However, this book is really not for the uninitiated. After struggling through the first part outlining why the second law of thermodynamics is central to an understanding of the processes of the universe, I realised that my current knowledge was not suitable to tackle this text, so I had to take a prolonged break from the book to refresh my understanding of thermodynamics in general. Once I had done this, I thought the rest of the book should now very simply and elegantly fall into place. How wrong I was. The second part of the book throws you into the strange world of relativity, conformal geometry, and black holes. I think I understand his broad point of this second part, that the Big Bang was a special moment in space-time as while it appears to breach the second law of thermodynamics it actually didn't. Why not? Well, this has all to do with the time-symmetry of matter and the nature of the universe as an inflationary body that conforms to a principle known as a null-cone. Nope, I'm not entirely sure what this means either. However, the consequence of these principles, while equally conceptionally difficult to envisage as what is laid out above, is at the very least one of the most fascinating thoughts a human can have: the Big Bang does NOT represent the start of THE universe, only of THIS universe. What an extraordinary thought, and the third part of his book is devoted to explaining exactly why and how this is the case: through something that he calls 'Conformal Cyclic Cosmology', or CCC. The basic principles of CCC are easy enough to grasp - the contention is that there has been a definite number of 'universes' each started by a Big Bang and each followed by an infinite future expansion that eventually (this is where it starts getting tricky) encounters a level of entropy similar to the earliest moments of the Big Bang, thus encapsulating what he refers to as an aeon. This is simple enough to grasp: we are one of many universes that have come about according to this predictable state. But it is the consequences and implications of this concept that really sent my mind reeling.The first has to do with the nature of the boundary between the universes. They are 'conformal' with each other in that they inhabit the same space-time (despite being separated by more than a googol years) and are attached together through a process called 'conformal rescaling', something that I really do not understand. The result of all this is a new solution to Einstein's equations that demonstrates that the Big Bang cannot have been the start of the universe. Fine. At least it's possible to try and understand this. The second and far more difficult problem is the physical implications of this for the universe; in other words exactly how the particles (the stuff) of our universe reacts to this situation and in particular the crossover point of the boundary between aeons. Here some really quite in-depth knowledge of quantum mechanics and particle physics would not go amiss. Essentially (at least what I could grasp from it) there are some particles that are able to cross the boundary without hindrance and some that are not (this all has to do with conformally invariant quantum theory, something that I do not understand in the slightest). The outcome of this is that space-time becomes curved, providing the kind of low-entropy state that is required by the second law of thermodynamics at the beginning of each aeon. This is therefore what makes the Big Bang 'special', and why it was not the beginning of the universe.This is really not an easy book to get through and only the most brilliant physicists the world has ever known should be able to consider this 'light reading'. Nevertheless, it really is worth the effort to try your best to get through it. It really does make you think about the universe in a completely new way, which is undoubtedly the greatest strength of this book. Perhaps Penrose could have made it slightly easier to comprehend (an introductory and concluding paragraph for each chapter trying to get across just the most basic central points of the chapter would have been much appreciated), and so for that I eschew him the hallowed 5-stars reserved for those works that are both brilliant and relatively easily comprehensible. But perhaps I'm being too harsh on him. Given the nature of the subject he is tackling, there is a not-insignificant chance that this book really does represent the most straightforward way to convey these ideas. Or maybe not, and I would certainly appreciate someone far more clever and knowledgable than myself to give it a go, or else I fear that we may lose this extraordinary idea to obscurity."
13,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,3,"A joint review of:Cycles of TimeRoger PenroseThe Grand DesignStephen Hawking and Leonard MlodinowOnce upon a time, Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking collaborated on a seminal piece of work which proved that if the general theory of relativity is correct our Universe began from a state of infinite density – a singularity. The investigation of the implications of that work, now more than 40 years old, still reverberate, providing the basis for intense debate among cosmologists. Since the 1960s, Penrose and Hawking have each written best-selling books introducing the lay reader to arcane areas of science. Now, they have independently produced books which address some of the implications of their early discovery about the origins of the Universe. But it would be hard to imagine two more different approaches to the subject, both in terms of content and of style. Penrose addresses the question, “what came before the Big Bang?” But it is important to appreciate that the Big Bang was not the singularity. There is a well-established consensus that the Universe as we know it emerged from as superhot, superdense state – the evidence for this comes in particular from studies of the famous cosmic microwave background radiation. But “superdense” does not mean “infinitely dense,” and there is room to suggest, or even expect, that under the extreme conditions “before the Big Bang” the laws of physics are not quite as described by Einstein so there may not have been a singularity. The way Penrose tackles the problem is by combining what we know about the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time with what we know about the Big Bang and the general theory. If that thought makes your head hurt, his book is not for you. It contains many equations and pulls few punches, an archetypal example of what an Oxford don thinks is a simple exposition of his subject. But if you do not have a maths phobia, and you can live with language like “at this point, it is appropriate to mention . . . ”, Cycles of Time can be highly recommended as an example of how cosmologists are now thinking the unthinkable in trying to look back beyond the Big Bang and forward beyond the death of our Universe. A superficial summary of Penrose’s thesis is that as the expanding Universe thins out and all the stars die the conditions that result are just right to produce a new Big Bang, so that universes like ours follow one another in an endless chain, or perhaps in an eternal loop, reminiscent of the image of the worm Ourobouros swallowing its own tail. As a speculation, this is a very old idea; the difference is that Penrose has the mathematical and physical foundations to make what he calls “conformal cyclic cosmology” respectable. It is also an idea whose time has come. I know of at least one other recent scientific suggestion, based on the idea of inflation, which also leads to the rebirth of the Universe from what in thermodynamic terms is sometimes called the “heat death”. Penrose has universes following each other. Stephen Hawking, writing with the American physicist Leonard Mlodinow (who suffers the indignity of having his name in much smaller type on the cover, but is no doubt crying all the way to the bank), has universes lying side by side. This idea of the “multiverse” is also familiar from science fiction and other speculations, but like the cyclic universe idea it is now firmly based on scientific fact. The trouble is, you would be hard pressed to be sure of this after reading The Grand Design.  Hawking and Mlodinow favour cartoons rather than equations, and anecdote rather than exposition. If you knew nothing at all about science, the resulting book would make for a light read on a short journey, but the story has been told many times, by many people (Paul Davies and Martin Rees spring to mind), and it’s hard to imagine that it can have take more than a month to write, whereas it’s easy to believe that Cycles of Time took years. This is born out by the failure of either of the authors, both of whom know better, to pick up the error which refers to black holes as one of the “new effects” predicted by the general theory of relativity, when they are also predicted by Newton’s theory of gravity. All this is particularly disappointing because I have a great fondness for the multiverse idea, which I believe to be the best explanation of why the Universe we see around us is the way it is. As Hawking and Mlodinow put it, in this view “the universe appeared spontaneously, starting off in every possible way. [Universes] aren’t just different in details, such as whether Elvis really did die young or whether turnips are a dessert food, but rather they differ even in their apparent laws of nature. In fact, many universes exist with many different sets of physical laws.” Where do those other universes exist? Penrose’s universes follow one another, in a sense separated by time. But the universes of Hawking and Mlodinow exist side by side in different dimensions, separated by space. This array of universes is what is known as the Multiverse. Part of the attraction of this idea is that it explains the many apparent coincidences that allow the existence of life forms like ourselves in the Universe we inhabit. To take just one example, more than half a century ago the physicist Fred Hoyle pointed out that the ability of stars to manufacture elements such as carbon and oxygen, which are essential for life as we know it, depends on a particular property of the nucleus of the carbon atom. If this and other parameters were not “just right” (and there is no a priori reason why they should have the properties they have) life as we know it would not exist. At one extreme, the existence of these cosmic coincidences suggests to some people that the Universe was designed for our benefit. But the multiverse idea says that there is a multitude of universes in which all possible combinations of the laws of physics are played out and that life forms like us will only be found in the ones where conditions are suitable, just as it is no surprise that polar bears live in the Arctic. Martin Rees, the outgoing President of the Royal Society, has used the analogy of the difference between a bespoke suit, made to measure for a particular customer, and an off-the-peg suit, chosen from as vast variety in a chain store, where one of them is bound to fit whoever walks in the door. In each case, it is no surprise that the suit fits. And this brings us back to Penrose’s conformal cyclic cosmology, since on that picture each universe in the chain, or cycle, may have a different set of physical laws. Whichever way you look at it, the multiverse explains our existence without the need to invoke a designer.This review first appeared in the Literary Review."
14,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,2,"No doubt, Roger Penrose is a brilliant mathematician. Unfortunately, he is not brilliant at communicating his unorthodox ideas. Cycles of Time is a technical bomb, replete with unsupported and unfalsifiable, but curious ideas. I like that Penrose thinks persistently outside the box, but this “popular science” book definitely needed to be written by a scientist with more experience at communication. Basically, Penrose posits that in the far future all particles will lose their mass. With only massless particles like photons around, metrics (e.g. time and distance) have no meaning. This would somehow then pave the way for a new big bang (no explanation how, or I didn’t get it), perpetuating a universe cycle that is eternal. This new big bang couldn’t start until all black holes have evaporated away, something estimated to take around 10^100 years. This evaporation process, he suggests, will actually reduce entropy (violating what scientists hold to be quite a robust law of our universe). In summary, all particles must lose their mass (e.g. the fundamental electron particle, which shows no sign of this). This also means that the law of conservation of electric charge must also be abandoned (no sign of this). Then, all information must be destroyed through the process of evaporating black holes (current theory does not support this information loss), and the second law of thermodynamics must actually reverse by entropy greatly decreasing in the future (no evidence or theory supports this). Finally, none of this is realistically testable. It is interesting to hear about, so I’m glad he shares his thoughts, but Penrose is so mathematical and technical that I almost stopped reading several times."

Quotations around popular science because it isn't exactly a popular science book. I would reckon you can get the ideas Penrose is trying to convey without delving into the mathematical detours. But getting a hold of the math changes the game. The concept of uncertainty in context of Penrose's work and this book still haunts and amazes me. If you are interested in thermodynamics and don't feel like you have a hold over the second law, read this book. It will likely leave you more confused and muddled but surely more invested in understanding the concepts of entropy, uncertainty and such. A great companion to this book?

24,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,3,"This is a really difficult book to read without some real physics education, in spite of it advertising as a popular science book.I think most popular science readers are familiar with the cosmological consensus of the unvierse starting with the Big Bang and likely ending with Big Chill. This book is meant to be a popular science account of Penrose's Conformal cyclic cosmology, which theorizes that these are not the fundamental bookends to our cosmology. Rather, a new universe can spring from the eventual heat death state, and therefore our big bang may itself have come from a prior heat death, affording the universe a grander and potentially infinite cyclic history, as it passes through ""moments"" where time no longer means anything due to the diffuse nature of a universe where only massless and therefore timeless bosons like photons and gravitons are all that's left. Penrose has developed a theory that he believes is falsifiable, and therefore lives on the productive side of the demarcation problem, unlike a lot of science floating around today (e.g. string theory). While there is some discussion of the tests to falsify (in the form of (currently disputed) CMB observations), most of this book an explanation of the theory itself. The early steps - in particular around defining entropy - were actually really illuminating for me. But I quickly got lost as Penrose advanced into the nuts and bolts of his theory. I think important prequisites that I was missing include a better understanding of GR. In particular, the geometric concepts that help one expore GR, such as the metric tensor, or even just the linear algebraic concept of the tensor, which I hadn't thought about since freshman year of college. For example, the ""conformal"" in conformal cyclic geometry was an entirely new concept for me. As far as I've been able to glean from this book and Wikipedia, it is the framework by which Penrose can maintain constant some physical attributes of the universe (namely, space), while being able to morph others (namely, time) without breaking any rules. This is known as general covariance or diffeomorphism. At this stage of detail, I've found videos like 3Blue1Brown's Quaternion essay to be much more productive studies of related geometric concepts.As an aside, this book is very interesting to pair with Susskind's ""Black Hole Wars"", as it relates to entropy/information. Citing the second law of thermodynamics and its connection to physical information, Susskind took as gospel that information can't be destroyed in a black hole, thereby challenging Hawking's original GR-based theorizing about Hawking Radiation. Penrose disagreed, and it turns out such destruction is a requirement for CCC. Ideas that Susskind (and I think most of the physics community) takes as gospel, Penros challenges. After spending time explaining how subjectivity creeps into any real physical definition of entropy, Penrose opines: ""I do not see why one should demand why there should always be a well-defined, physically precise notion of entropy that is entirely objective and consequentially 'out there' in nature in some absolute sense, where this objective entropy almost never decreases as time progresses."" Penrose is happy to be contrarian in this instance, because he suspects that information destruction in this case is a key to resolving the confusing dual probabilistic-deterministic nature of quantum mechanics, thereby following Einstein/Schrodinger/Dirac's collective hope that quantum mechanics is a provisional theory that will ultimately be superceded by one that consistent with GR."
25,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62545863-jonathan,3,"6/10Either Penrose misunderstood his audience, or I mistook this for a work of popular science, or both. I grasped his concept quickly enough, and understood his argument in broad strokes, but his math got beyond me almost immediately, and most of his arguments hinged on that. His contention in this work is that the big bang contained to much information to be random, and as such, was most likely the result of the contraction and re-expanison of a precious universe, that we are just the most recent iteration of. He makes many good points in defense of this, but I could not help but think, from an admittedly biased perspective, that there was another answer. That if we see before us a well ordered universe, with a well ordered beginning, then the most logical explanation is that is what set in order. Penrose himself seems to get close to this point of view as well, but ultimately commits to his CCC (conformal cyclical cosmology) theory, which is a beautiful one, that still does not have me, or much of the scientific community, convinced as of yet.Penrose is obviously brilliant, and is a decent writer as well, but in writing a work for the masses, he should probably use analogies more often, or even stop at the end of each chapter and explain his point in layman's terms. Either that, or I should spend more time in this realm."
26,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4358175-jon,1," I like math. I like science. This has a lot of both. Unfortunately, this is not Neal Degrasse Tyson pop-sci. This is capital M math explained with unintelligible diagrams. I read the whole damned thing, and every exclamation point was lost on me. By the end I was picking out words like ""the"" and ""and"" and beaming because I recognized them. Is that the book's fault? Penrose won a series of physics related awards, some alongside Hawking. At one point in the book, Penrose basically says Hawking is wrong. Know anyone who can do that and be taken seriously? Yea, me neither. Penrose is essentially a wizard. In that magical world, I'd be the dog sniffing around for crumbs and staring off into space with my head cocked. Had I fed this book to an actual dog, the dog would've gotten more out of it than I did So there. I'm too dumb for this book or the book is terrible. Either way, 1 star should guarantee that I don't get any more like it. I imagine all the 5 star readers in this list are either physicists, liars, or possibly a room full of bubbling brain jars wired in series. I'm not sure. In any case, they have absorbed material beyond my capacity and should be hired before me."
27,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81699411-the-book-mufti,2,"Roger Penrose is a delightful person. He’s warm, affable, and always excited to share his theoretical ideas. But he is constitutionally incapable of describing things adequately for laypeople. I saw a lecture of his where he tried to explain twistor theory to a visiting audience, and he kept going on lengthy tangents involving math that would probably need an undergraduate degree in physics to grasp fully.And that is also the problem with this book. Given how very abstract the idea of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology actually is, there is an enormous amount of mathematics in the book that will simply be impossible for laypeople to understand—this is most frustrating because none of it is really necessary to explain the abstract idea. There is a twelve-minute video on YouTube of Penrose explaining the notion to his interviewer, and it lays everything out pretty well in far less time than it would take to read this book."
28,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11889175-christopher,3,"Ive been meaning to read this for awhile. Conformal Cyclic Comsmology has become a recent fascination of mine and the videos and expaliners I have seen all make a convincing case for it-at least as a thought experiment if nothing else. I also consider myself above the base level of scientific literacy for a layman but definitely still an outsider. Usually, that means I have no problem with science a step or two above popular science. But even so, this one was a real slog for me. And if I could barely make sense of much of it, I can only imagine how hard it would be for someone who just does popular science usually. So...be warned. It isnt a fun read but its still worth it if you want to see the arguments in their most direct form.But if you aren't a physicist you would probably be better off looking up some lectures on the topic online."

I enjoyed the first two sections of the book, but the last section delved too deeply into Penrose’s pet theory of CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology) for me to follow well. The diagrams throughout were extremely helpful for me as a visual learner. To tackle the first two sections, it’s helpful to have some background in thermodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, for which I’d highly recommend the Susskind video lectures. "

49,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
50,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
51,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
52,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
53,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "
54,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,3,"Enjoyed reading, but really only understood maybe 20% of the material. Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this book to other folks looking for general popular level science writing."
55,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889315-christy,3,"Too mathy for me (although I appreciated his lack of condescension in presenting the math clearly and cogently for the general public) but I'm interested in all current non-theist, and preferably non-metaphysical attempts to speculate about the origin and destiny of the cosmos. So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "
56,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Penrose dissolves the completeness of the big bang onto a series of unfolding events so that the implications of the 2nd law of thermodynamics can be seen as reverseable (beyond entropy). Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy.

79,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
80,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
81,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
82,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
83,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "

Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter.

So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "

109,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
110,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
111,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
112,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
113,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "
114,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,3,"Enjoyed reading, but really only understood maybe 20% of the material. Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this book to other folks looking for general popular level science writing."
115,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889315-christy,3,"Too mathy for me (although I appreciated his lack of condescension in presenting the math clearly and cogently for the general public) but I'm interested in all current non-theist, and preferably non-metaphysical attempts to speculate about the origin and destiny of the cosmos. So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "
116,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Penrose dissolves the completeness of the big bang onto a series of unfolding events so that the implications of the 2nd law of thermodynamics can be seen as reverseable (beyond entropy). Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy. These multiple cyclings he presents in a dizzying display of math and science as being plausible, with the conclusion that we should be able to spot in our enormous universe the residue of past universes as a latent curvature in space -- so that information about pasts universes may gleamed from the structure of the sky.This is a fairly interesting book, written pretty clearly for those of us without a theoretical physics background. But it comes as part of an example of speculative physics, so that whatever is a possible reorientation of the pieces proven by others can spark a completely different view of how things could be... since we have no ""natural"" method of justifying what is true, we are stuck trying to resolve all permutations of what could be, leading to interesting and intensive books like this one."

For example, oil separates from water on its own. Many will be inclined to call that creating order out of disorder. Penrose patiently explains why that is not the case, and how entropy, when properly defined, does increase in this case indeed.

One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."

That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
141,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
142,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
143,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "
144,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,3,"Enjoyed reading, but really only understood maybe 20% of the material. Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this book to other folks looking for general popular level science writing."
145,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889315-christy,3,"Too mathy for me (although I appreciated his lack of condescension in presenting the math clearly and cogently for the general public) but I'm interested in all current non-theist, and preferably non-metaphysical attempts to speculate about the origin and destiny of the cosmos. So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "
146,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Penrose dissolves the completeness of the big bang onto a series of unfolding events so that the implications of the 2nd law of thermodynamics can be seen as reverseable (beyond entropy). Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy. These multiple cyclings he presents in a dizzying display of math and science as being plausible, with the conclusion that we should be able to spot in our enormous universe the residue of past universes as a latent curvature in space -- so that information about pasts universes may gleamed from the structure of the sky.This is a fairly interesting book, written pretty clearly for those of us without a theoretical physics background. But it comes as part of an example of speculative physics, so that whatever is a possible reorientation of the pieces proven by others can spark a completely different view of how things could be... since we have no ""natural"" method of justifying what is true, we are stuck trying to resolve all permutations of what could be, leading to interesting and intensive books like this one."

For example, oil separates from water on its own. Many will be inclined to call that creating order out of disorder. Penrose patiently explains why that is not the case, and how entropy, when properly defined, does increase in this case indeed. The later parts of the book are much more speculative and full of technical details. You have to be a physicist to really appreciate what Penrose has to say here."

I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X.

I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
171,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."

They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging.

Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter.

So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "

Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy. These multiple cyclings he presents in a dizzying display of math and science as being plausible, with the conclusion that we should be able to spot in our enormous universe the residue of past universes as a latent curvature in space -- so that information about pasts universes may gleamed from the structure of the sky.This is a fairly interesting book, written pretty clearly for those of us without a theoretical physics background. But it comes as part of an example of speculative physics, so that whatever is a possible reorientation of the pieces proven by others can spark a completely different view of how things could be... since we have no ""natural"" method of justifying what is true, we are stuck trying to resolve all permutations of what could be, leading to interesting and intensive books like this one."

I am not sure if the book answers that question. But it comes close. I think. The initial part of the book is excellent. It clears up the vague notions most of us have about entropy. For example, oil separates from water on its own. Many will be inclined to call that creating order out of disorder. Penrose patiently explains why that is not the case, and how entropy, when properly defined, does increase in this case indeed. The later parts of the book are much more speculative and full of technical details. You have to be a physicist to really appreciate what Penrose has to say here."

I enjoyed the first two sections of the book, but the last section delved too deeply into Penrose’s pet theory of CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology) for me to follow well. The diagrams throughout were extremely helpful for me as a visual learner. To tackle the first two sections, it’s helpful to have some background in thermodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, for which I’d highly recommend the Susskind video lectures. "

199,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
200,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."

For example, oil separates from water on its own. Many will be inclined to call that creating order out of disorder. Penrose patiently explains why that is not the case, and how entropy, when properly defined, does increase in this case indeed.

229,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
230,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
231,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
232,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"

The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic.

259,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
260,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
261,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
262,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
263,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "

Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this book to other folks looking for general popular level science writing."

So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "
266,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Penrose dissolves the completeness of the big bang onto a series of unfolding events so that the implications of the 2nd law of thermodynamics can be seen as reverseable (beyond entropy). Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy. These multiple cyclings he presents in a dizzying display of math and science as being plausible, with the conclusion that we should be able to spot in our enormous universe the residue of past universes as a latent curvature in space -- so that information about pasts universes may gleamed from the structure of the sky.This is a fairly interesting book, written pretty clearly for those of us without a theoretical physics background. But it comes as part of an example of speculative physics, so that whatever is a possible reorientation of the pieces proven by others can spark a completely different view of how things could be... since we have no ""natural"" method of justifying what is true, we are stuck trying to resolve all permutations of what could be, leading to interesting and intensive books like this one."

289,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,0,"This book begins with an extremely lucid explanation of entropy. I really like thinking geometrically (in terms of spaces), so Penrose's geometric explanations really worked for me. Entropy is basically a measure of how large a configuration space of underlying properties are grouped together and identified under a 'coarse' property. My only other meaningful encounter was with the related concept of information content. One application of Shanon information content is as follows: by repeatedly choosing measurements with events of the most equal probability, one could guarantee a measurement of some property we're interested with the lowest bound on the maximum number of steps.For example, one could imagine dicing up a watermelon which a worm has infiltrated, trying to narrow down in which one centimeter cube of the watermelon the worm is located. The watermelon is 25 by 25 by 25 cm, one of those square watermelons from Japan. One can only make, perhaps, 2 cuts at each turn, parallel to any face of the watermelon at only integer values, in cm from the sides. How should one go about cutting it up in the smallest guaranteed number of turns?Note that the entropy is not a measure of the average size of watermelon slice, x in X. This would lead one to the incorrect conclusion that one should minimise the entropy. The entropy in question here does not, as it usually does, concern the physical configuration of the system at all.Rather, the entropy is a measure of the average size of the hypothetical 'probability state space' associated with each event x in X. For example, an event with a 1 in 3 chance exists in a state space of size 3. Note that the average size of the watermelon slice one would expect to have trapped the worm in is inversely related to the size of its probability. Thus, by maximising the average size of the state spaces of x in X, one minimises the average number of configurations of x in the underlying system can exist in. By maximising the size of the smallest state space - making the sizes of the state spaces as equal to each other as possible, one is decreasing the upper-bound on the number of underlying configurations of x in the system. Thus, the entropy of the probability has a sort of inverse relationship with the entropy of the physical system. The smaller the entropy of each physical state, the larger the entropy of its probability state space. It's like by chopping the physical state up more finely, we're creating more probability states out of thin air. What's this got to to with information? By maximising the entropy of the probability states as specified under a series of measurements, we are in fact reducing the entropy of the physical configurations of each of those states - in effect, we are choosing a series of measurements which, with highest probability (according to some priors) given some finite number of steps, narrows down our answer to as small a volume of physical states as possible. It's a way of using statistics to get a higher yield on the right answer.Anyway, a disclaimer: the above is assuming that the size of the probability for each event is proportional to some measured values regarding the system.Entropy of all x in X = Sum over x: log2[1/P(x)] * P(x)Another way is to see that each measurement, or cut, is not merely a 'narrowing-down' of the space where the worm resides - but also a 'discarding' of spaces where the worm does NOT reside. By choosing those cuts with the greatest total entropy, one also guarantees that a maximum amount of the configuration space is ruled out by each cut."
290,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22966236-domino,2,"I don't expect this book to be of interest to many people, and the physics in it is pretty unlikely to work. That said, I did find parts of it interesting.Penrose has always been a contrarian. He still thinks quantum mechanics isn't ultimately true and needs to be modified. But now it seems he's become very against the idea of cosmic inflation. Something that has a huge amount of theoretical support, and at least a smattering of good experimental support for it now.The first third of the book is an explanation of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Here he says nothing controversial, and I think he actually does a pretty excellent job of it. For anyone who has heard of the 2nd law but doesn't fully understand how it works and how it's related to the ""arrow of time"", by all means I'd recommend reading this third. I think you can probably find equivalent presentations elsewhere though.The second third of the book is an explanation of what he thinks is wrong with the present ""Standard Model of Cosmology"", specifically cosmic inflation. He claims that unless things are finely tuned, one would expect the universe to start out in a state dominated by white holes (the opposite of a black hole). I think it's true inflation does require some fine tuning in order to work, but I felt that he exaggerates the problem and I'm not sure I buy that it has anything to do with white holes. My own view is that it's obvious that the early universe should require a special state in order to get started, and I don't see anything all that surprising or mysterious about this. Penrose, however, sees this as a big problem which needs to be solved.The third part of the book is an explanation of his proposed alternative to inflation, conformal cyclic cosmology. The basic idea is that the universe goes through aeons of time... starting out in a timeless conformal state where length and time have no operational meaning, then transitioning to a state of linear expansion, gradually transitioning to a phase where dark energy dominates where you have accelerating expansion, and finally transitioning back into the same conformal timeless state it started in... wash, rinse, and repeat. This was the most interesting part to me, because I hadn't seen anyone propose something like this before. (Other cyclic cosmologies usually involve a series of bangs and crunches, but his involves no crunch or even any contracting phase.) It was interesting in a ""wouldn't it be neat if that were true"" kind of way, but I see many good reasons why it probably isn't true, so while I am fine with Penrose continuing to explore this avenue, I do expect it will lead to a dead end in terms of an actual working proposal for how the universe is structured.One of the problems with it is that entropy would have to either keep increasing throughout every cycle, or suddenly reset back to very low entropy at each cycle. Penrose claims it's the latter which happens, and his reason is that all of the entropy ends up in black holes toward the end of the accelerating phase and then just gets erased from existence as they evaporate. This goes along with his long-held feeling that quantum mechanics, as it stands today, cannot be correct (it predicts that entropy cannot just be erased like that, even in a black hole). Like many of his ideas, this book is about what happens if we assume that gravity can be treated as classical in far more regimes than mainstream physicists believe... in other words if we can just completely ignore quantum gravity in most cases. I still think this along with most of Penrose's controversial ideas are very likely just wrong."
291,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373219-richard-needham,4,"In the beginning was entropy…that mysterious measure of nature’s tendency toward disorder and randomness: entropy, known as time’s arrow and captured in the second law of thermodynamics…and Penrose starts with entropy in his discussion of cosmology. From an explanation of entropy, which is familiar to those who have studied general physics or chemistry (or better statistical thermodynamics), Penrose then launches into cosmological models based on different assumptions for spatial curvature following the Big Bang (paradoxically a very low entropy state): Elliptic, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic; and how measures of the cosmic microwave background influence the choice. Penrose continues with an introduction to Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, which seems to predict (or at least allow) multiple rebirths of the universe as ‘big bangs’ after truly immense time periods of expansion by way of ‘conformal rescaling’. This is different than the theory of a spring-like expansion and contraction of the universe from a singularity back to the same singularity (this would require a severe violation of the second law of thermodynamics and in any case is disproven by our current understanding of the expansion of the universe). If this seems daunting reading, yes, it is. But Penrose is so lucid in his explanations and illustrative examples (eggs falling off tables, MC Escher drawings) that a highly motivated layman can grasp at least some of this with effort. To really grasp, however, requires familiar with some very high-powered mathematics involving tensor calculus, and physics to include, for example, the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. One of the most interesting parts to me was Penrose’s development of the mathematical analogy between Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Einstein’s equations of relativity, and how this can be seen in gravitational lenses that both magnify (Einstein’s tensor E) and introduce elliptical distortion (Weyl conformal tensor C) to starlight. And, it is worth the effort to grasp concepts of the universe from the mind of one of the great cosmologists of our time (along with, say, Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking). After pondering and thinking on what Penrose lays out, one begins to understand what space and time and reality are (and they are certainly not at all like what we experience day-to-day). This book is highly recommended to the very curious reader with a good science background and willing to stretch the mind. For the general reader interested in cosmology Hawkings’ Brief History of Time may be a reluctantly better choice, but it would be a shame not to get just a taste of Penrose."
292,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12292735-steve,3,"I'm really not sure how to score this but definitely not one of Roger's best works or even perhaps his best thought processes. I'm really not sure who this book was aimed at as it started so slowly and randomly then suddenly gained pace and by 3.2 was screaming down a track whose terminus was nowhere in sight. It really seemed like Mr Penrose was pulling together the threads of an argument whilst writing the book itself and then went for a wander along a shelf of postulations pulling at ideas like carpet samples, rejecting ones that he needed even have introduced at all in the teeth of a coherent argument. To attempt to dismiss competing theories as justification for your view is like the 'last man standing' or 'bar room' theory of physics.For me the ultimate proof of any mathematical description for our Universe is its inherent elegant simplicity. What Penrose exposes is that theories around the emergence of the Universe and its ultimate demise are far from elegant and in fact far from simple. They remind me of a cartoon I saw a number of years ago showing a white coated professional in front of a large chalkboard covered in formulae, which led inexorably to a large cloud graphic bearing the label ""then a miracle happens"" and resulting in equivalence of X. If the last mile of a theory requires the emergence of a magical force, field or constant then it is generally time to think again. The problem is that theories of quantum effects are like offspring and they are adopted with irrational emotion. This too is evident here where any distortion of observed evidence, no matter how 'non conformant' is seen as evidence of a cosmic 'Big Foot'. Penrose passion is symmetry through his aeon theory of cyclic cosmology and he smoothes and irons and flattens the formulae to find any evidence of a previous and near identical universe before our 'present' big bang. Observable data is always going to be tough when the effects he is looking for are predicted to be longer than 'our' Universe has existed, yet at the final close he throws up intriguing data that, although not a perfect fit for his theory would be fascinating if they could be proved to be echoes of a former Universe.This is a book without conclusion, with a postulated theory that is left hanging. Work in progress it seems so why publish a book at all?"
293,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2441212-scott,2,"Fundamentally, the problem is with the reader and not so much the book itself. Going beyond the first chapter requires a grounding in physics if not quantum physics on a cosmological scale that I simply lack. While I could grasp the author's premise and the broader concepts, the supporting graphs and equations were a struggle that required breaking out in turn, a physics textbook, a physics dictionary and ultimately my physics encyclopedia. Structurally the book is sound, three sections covering in turn, entropy, the current understanding of the nature of the universe in context of Entropy, and the author's own premise on the nature of universe. The tone of the text is personable, conversation-able assuming you're good friends with a lauded physicist. The only shortcoming in presentation is the author's tendency to stop in mid-explanation of a concept and add an additional detail or caveat; the problem is four or five of these can be added before a return to the initial topic. Most of this occurs in the section on Entropy. As an aside, once finished with the section, I literally had to go back and see if a definition of Entropy and the Second Law (much referred throughout) was ever given. I am still not certain. Rich with appendices providing more detailed graphs and equations and fully footnoted, I imagine this would be an interesting read to physics students or someone more active in studying the science of physics. To the lay person who has a general interest in the topic, its not a casual read. "
294,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,3,"Enjoyed reading, but really only understood maybe 20% of the material. Puts forth an interesting cosmological idea; but the deeper exploration is at once too dense for a popular-level reader, like myself, and too hand-wavy for a rigorous professional audience (or so I'd imagine).The first section discusses entropy & its implications for the conditions around the Big Bang. I found this the most clear & enjoyable part of the book. I'm not sure if this is because the concepts are discussed at a more gradual, abstract level than later on or because I'm more somewhat more familiar with information theory than general relativity and the like. Either way, this was the highlight of the book.As for the remainder, I understood the general gist of his proposed conformal cyclic cosmology but could follow almost none of the details. Penrose comes across as a brilliant thinker with long experience in physics & cosmology, but he can never seem to avoid dropping into domain jargon when trying to explain his ideas. This may not be an issue for those who are already familiar with his mathematical notation, terms, etc. For mere mortals like myself, though, it makes for whole sections that are nearly impossible to parse. Sometimes a single page took an hour to read, requiring extended detours to Wikipedia to check up on definitions & concepts.Perhaps I'll try this again when I'm more familiar with the subject matter. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this book to other folks looking for general popular level science writing."
295,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889315-christy,3,"Too mathy for me (although I appreciated his lack of condescension in presenting the math clearly and cogently for the general public) but I'm interested in all current non-theist, and preferably non-metaphysical attempts to speculate about the origin and destiny of the cosmos. So I can now add conformal cyclic cosmology to my collection: an infinite series of universes whose endings merge into the beginnings of the next through a matching low entropy and absence of structure and mass. (Even though the Second Law of Thermodynamics says entropy always increases, Penrose says that at a spacetime near infinity all matter will have collapsed into black holes, which he says will then evaporate, destroying entropy... I have to say it all sounds a bit wishful thinking-y when you put it like that. And of course we're no closer to knowing the mechanism by which this transition from the almost infinitely large to the infinitesimally small happens. Also some key evidence he thought he had in the cosmic microwave background radiation has been disputed... But anyway, that's just where theoretical physics is at these days - it's not a consensus sort of place. In fact, physicists can't even seem to agree if it's the best of times or the worst of times for cosmology.) "
296,0224080369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Penrose dissolves the completeness of the big bang onto a series of unfolding events so that the implications of the 2nd law of thermodynamics can be seen as reverseable (beyond entropy). Rather entropy becomes merely one direction of thermodynamics. Penrose points out that entropy and the 2nd law are not synonymous; that ""reversing"" the 2nd law can also result in the transformation of energy into mechanical energy. These multiple cyclings he presents in a dizzying display of math and science as being plausible, with the conclusion that we should be able to spot in our enormous universe the residue of past universes as a latent curvature in space -- so that information about pasts universes may gleamed from the structure of the sky.This is a fairly interesting book, written pretty clearly for those of us without a theoretical physics background. But it comes as part of an example of speculative physics, so that whatever is a possible reorientation of the pieces proven by others can spark a completely different view of how things could be... since we have no ""natural"" method of justifying what is true, we are stuck trying to resolve all permutations of what could be, leading to interesting and intensive books like this one."

I guess you can't expect any quantum physicist to be ""accessible,"" yet some of them (Hawking, Tyson, Greene, etc.) have found a way to do that. Penrose...so far as I can tell...really doesn't care to be that type. He's not writing for the masses. He's writing for the mathematicians. I really wanted to like this more than I did. I love the subject of spacetime, the big bang and what happened before the big bang, but I'm obviously not bright enough or well-studied enough to handle the material of proof.

I am not sure if the book answers that question. But it comes close. I think. The initial part of the book is excellent. It clears up the vague notions most of us have about entropy. For example, oil separates from water on its own. Many will be inclined to call that creating order out of disorder. Penrose patiently explains why that is not the case, and how entropy, when properly defined, does increase in this case indeed. The later parts of the book are much more speculative and full of technical details. You have to be a physicist to really appreciate what Penrose has to say here."
