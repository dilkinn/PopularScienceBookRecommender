0,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51576-lisa,5,"This Will Make You Smarter is a challenging book that leaves you with a lot to think about. The essays are short — some shorter than a single page — that cover interesting scientific concepts, new and old ideas to help us think about the world.The founder and publisher of the online science salon, Edge.org, John Brockman, does a great job editing this collection, turning more than 100 essays on a wide range of topics into a coherent manuscript that works its way across the spectrum. You start out talking about one concept and smoothly work your way into another — it definitely kept me interested in topics that could potentially be pretty dry.There are too many important concepts to cover them all, but there were a few that I found really interesting. First, there was an interesting article by Douglas Rushkoff* called “Technologies Have Biases.” This passage was thought-provoking:“We are free to use any car we like to get to work — gasoline, diesel, electric or hydrogen-powered — and this sense of choice blinds us to the fundamental bias of the automobile toward distance, commuting, suburbs and energy consumption.”And that’s true — we buy a hybrid because it’s “greener” and we are pro-environment, but the very fact of buying a car shows a preference that we don’t even think about.I also found “The Focusing Illusion” by Daniel Kahneman** a fascinating idea:“Marketers exploit the focusing illusion. When people are induced to believe that they ‘must have’ a good, they greatly exaggerate the difference that good will make to the quality of their life.”Think about that and apply it to our current political climate. When politicians convince us that a particular issue is important, no matter what the issue, we attach an unreasonable importance to specific laws or measures related to that issue, and the difference they will make in the government. It has given me a different slant on the political commercials I have seen.There are also a number of essays on risk and uncertainty, and just how bad humans are at understanding risk and dealing with it. The chance that we might be killed in a terrorist attack is almost infinitesimal, but we have spent a huge amount of money, time and effort protecting ourselves against the threat. On the other hand, we are far more likely to die in our car on the way to the grocery store, and yet many people don’t even bother with seat belts or regular brake checks.All in all, this was a terrific, thought-provoking read that can be applied to so many aspects of modern life. I think that anyone who picks this up is going to find topics that interest them and cause them to rethink their usual assumptions. I would love to buy a copy for all of the teachers I know and challenge them to use some of these concepts in their classrooms! (There is a great essay on the importance of understanding which concepts are easy to teach and which ones are harder to grasp — they could start with that.) I will definitely be passing this on to some thoughtful friends."
1,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4503128-graham-herrli,4,"The Edge.org question of 2011 was ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?"" Many of the world's most famous thinkers responded to it, and their responses are compiled in this book in one-to-four-page essays organized thematically.It's somewhat ironic that although the book is a collection of the ideas of ""great minds,"" many of the essays emphasize the importance of not trusting authority. Debates over climate change and creationism were mentioned often enough to become a bit annoying, and some of the suggestions of short-hand abstractions-that-people-would-benefit-from-knowing were too obvious or too repetitive of ideas expressed in nearby essays, but the book nevertheless contains some interesting ideas. These include:(view spoiler)[ * Scientists should lobby and advertise in favor of science (22). * We should conduct controlled experiments of different teaching methodologies in schools (26). * People should stop assuming that things have single causes (33-6). * The difference that one factor will have one one metric (such as wealth will have on happiness) is overestimated by people because when they focus upon that factor, they automatically neglect to consider others (49-50). * The probability of harm from harm-prevention systems often outweighs that of the harm they were designed to prevent (68-70). * It can promote creativity and new connections to read an article about an unfamiliar topic in an unfamiliar place each week (101-2). * We understand new information by making minor modifications to our existing schemata rather than by building it up from scratch (132-4). * Our five traditional ""senses"" are actually the result of input from multiple sense organs (142). * Bacteria can the programmed to solve a simple sudoku (166). * Various things may be memorable because they lie close to ""cultural attractors."" The reason there are only a small number of imagined supernatural beings may be that each is realistic, violating only one fundamental assumption about reality (180-3). * Abstracting things to align them with a timeless ideal removes them from reality, meaning that theoretical physics and mathematics are philosophically akin to religion (221-4). * Many personality traits are genetically heritable (229-34). * Human achievement is based upon communication between individuals with different specializations rather than upon the intelligence of a few bright minds. No one person knows how to make even a pencil (257-8). * By understanding that many decisions are partially unconscious, we can gain a greater awareness of factors subconsciously impacting our own decisions and can be less likely to attribute the flaws of others to conscious intention (352). * Depending on what ""inert"" substance is used as a ""placebo,"" it can actually have a physiological impact upon results (independent of the placebo effect) (381-5). (hide spoiler)]Some notable inaccuracies include:(view spoiler)[ * Jennifer Jacquet's referring to the great auk as a mammal (175). It was a large flightless bird, similar to a puffin. * Don Tapscott's unsubstantiated mention of multitaskers having ""better active working memory and better switching abilities"" (251). Studies by Clifford Nass have shown the opposite to be true. (hide spoiler)]"
2,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377693-pvw,3,"Edge is an organisation that promotes the spreading of cultural and scientific knowledge to a general public. Every year they pose a general philosophical question and publish some of the best answers by prominent intellectuals. This book contains the answers to the proposition: ""Which new scientific concept should belong to everyone's conceptual toolkit?""In bundling the answers, the editor made one unfortunate mistake. He grouped them thematically. Since many researchers promote the same concept, grouping all those together always results in three to four consecutive essays that basically tell the same story. It might have been better to spread the answers morde randomly.Apart from that, this book is excellent to read in small portions. I will try to summarize just a few of the more interesting propositions.- Nexuscausality: in real life, things rarely have only one cause. Contrary to the human inclination to find a single guilty reason for every disaster, situations generally are the result of a myriad of reasons, all of which contribute only in a small portion to the eventual result.- Neuroplasticity: the brain has a huge adaptive potential for tasks it needs to perform regularly. Too often people simply accept limitations of their intellect or character. Just like you can train the body however, those properties can be changed by exercising the desired behaviour or ability.- Supervenience: although psychological and even social mechanisms can probably be described in terms of the participating atoms, such a description would by far exceed the calculating potential of the strongest computers. Eventhough particle physics may lie at the base of every occurence in nature, it is much more economical to describe events on a larger scale with its own, generalizing laws. Supervenience means that not one system of description is superior to another. It just says that every level of reality has an approach that is best suited for that specific size. Similarly, newtonian pshysics supervene quantum mechanics for basic laws of motion and gravity. The latter explanation may be even more exact, but the enormous complexity of it makes it a lot less suited than the simple and quite accurate predictions offered by Newton's laws.Anyway, a nice book to have on a living room table, to leaf through once in a while."

But this book suffers from having too many authors - so for one thing there is quite a lot of redundancy, as multiple people advocate very similar principles, which often overlap with the essays of others, and for another thing everyone was limited to an average of two pages, so there isn't enough room to say anything with any real depth. It's just a basic, quick response to the question, without a lot of detail.This is compounded by the fact that I've been reading a lot on this concept over the last few years, so often I have read entire books, or multiple long essays, on many of these theories, and often by the very people who are writing them. This just made these little snippets seem even more shallow by comparison.So, basically, if ""improving your thinking"" is something you have an interest in, you've probably already come across 90% of these ideas in a better form. I don't want to bag it out too much - this book genuinely would serve as a great introduction to someone who hasn't come across these ideas before. But that person isn't me."
4,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10100154-mike,3,"Each essay is only 3-5 pages, making this a great book to pick up when you have a few minutes of free time and want a little bit of intellectual stimulation. That said, some essays were great and thought-provoking, but others were painfully dull and a chore to get through."
5,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"I read this because I wanted to think about how to write accessible, sexy-sounding prose to use in grant proposals. It contains plenty of both good and bad examples of how to make complicated ideas sound exciting to non-experts. The social psychologists and pop-minded economists are the masters of this particular skill. Basically they can just present a couple of examples of goofy human behavior and their job is done. (Though there is also a nice entry on ""Anecdotalism"", which points out the problems with this approach.) The Physicists are surprisingly terrible at saying anything gripping, and often lapse into very bad philosophy. Some examples:""Truth as a model"" by Neil Gershenfeld (MIT Physicist)First two sentences: ""The most common misunderstanding about science is that scientists seek and find truth. They don't---they make and test models"" (72)Last sentence: ""Truth is a model"" (73). Spot the problem!Another one:""Our perceptions are crucial in appreciating truth. However, we do not apprehend objective reality"". [UH OH! WHY NOT???] ""Perception is based on recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli derived from patterns of electrical impulses"" (43). Why does this mean we don't apprehend objective reality? `But the masters of banality are the writers from the art world (sadly):""But there is another case for curating as a vanguard activity for the twenty-first century. As the artist Tino Sehgal has pointed out, modern societies find themselves today in an unprecedented situation: The problem of lack, or scarcity, which has been the primary factor motivating scientific and technological innovation, is now joined and even superseded by the problem of the global effects of overproduction and resource use. Thus, moving beyond the object as the locus of meaning has a further relevance"" (119). ""Lack"" is ""the primary factor motivating scientific and technological innovation""? What does it mean for the object to be ""the locus of meaning""? I have absolutely no idea. And no one else does either. "

Well, wrong medium and rather disappointing uniformity of thought - stick to edge online during your lunch break.A few themes come up over and over again - complexity, unpredictability, evolutionary biology, cognitive biases. While these subjects are certainly intellectually stimulating and while i like other longer works by a handful of the participating authors , reading an essay after essay that uncover slightly different facets of the same core ideas in the same softly self congratulatory tone gets tiresome quickly.This will not make you smarter."

He's bros with the smartest, most interesting people in the world.Anyway. He's cranking out these little essay books and they're all really good. The way it works is he periodically asks all of his crew to write short (usually one or two paragraph long) pieces about different subjects. Since they're the smartest, most interesting people in the world, the results tend to be pretty smart and interesting.This one is all about what's your favorite Shorthand Abstraction (SHA). A SHA is like a word or phrase that describes some complex phenomenon in a way that enables people to more easily think about complex, abstract issues. They're like tools for your cognitive tool kit. And as indicated by the books title, they make you smarter. Some notable SHAs are natural selection, placebo etc.Another example is the Pareto principle, sometimes known as the ""80/20 rule. Examples include a pattern whereby the top 1% of the population control 35% of the wealth or, on Twitter, the top 2% of users send 60% of the messages. Anyway. This book is loaded with cool lesser know SHAs and interesting reframed of some old standards, all in bite sized portions. Good stuff."
9,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3040195-robin,3,"The author asked many famous people, ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?""The idea intrigued me; from each successful, ""famous"" person, what single thing is it important for people to know? It seemed like the book would be full of good advice.However, I didn't enjoy reading it. I suppose all the concepts were scientific ones, which didn't interest me. None of the writers (I only read a few. I didn't read the whole book.) spoke about why or how their particular concept could change the world if everybody knew it.This is the second book I've read where the author asked many dozen people something and compiled the answers. I didn't like either one. It could be that an answer given in 2-3 pages doesn't give enough background for the answer to have meaning. Perhaps we need to know each person better, to understand why/how they came up with their answer.There is one answer that I felt was quite good, and many others that had decent ideas, so it wasn't a complete waste of my time."

The Edge is an organization that presents original ideas by today's leading thinkers from a wide spectrum of scientific fields. The 2011 Edge question is, ""What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody's Cognitive Toolkit?"" This worthwhile 448-page book contains 151 short essays that address the question. The quality of these essays range from the obvious to the truly profound.For my sake, I created a spreadsheet of all the essays and graded them from zero to five stars based on quality. Five star essays are those that provide a great description of the author's favorite scientific concept. On the other hand, those receiving a one or even a zero represent essays that were not worthy of this book. Of course, this is just one reviewer's personal opinion. I basically reprised the same formula I used to review, ""This Explains Everything"".Positives:1. This series by ""The Edge"" always deliver a high-quality product.2. A great premise, ""What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody's Cognitive Toolkit?""3. A great range of scientific topics: biology, genetics, computer science, neurophysiology, psychology, and physics.4. There were a number of outstanding essays deserving of five stars for me. I will list my favorites as positives in this review. In order of appearance, the first by P.Z. Myers' ""The Mediocrity Principle"". It discusses the importance of having basic math skills and accepting the notion that we aren't special. Sounds harsh on the surface but P.Z. won me over with his persuasive argument.5. Sean Carroll's ""Pointless Universe"". His contention is that the universe is not advancing toward a goal but is caught up in an unbreakable pattern.6. Max Tegmarr's ""Promoting a Scientific Lifestyle"". The need to educate the public on science. Hit on all the pertinent points with mastery.7. Kathryn Schulz's ""The Pessimistic Meta-Induction from the History of Science"". Makes the compelling case that there are no absolutes in science. Understanding that science is about constructing models rather than revealing reality.8. Jonah Lehrer's ""Control Your Spotlight."" Learning how to control short list of thoughts in working memory.9. Kevin Kelly's ""Failure Liberates Success."" Failures in science can lead to success.10. Steven Pinker's ""Positive-Sum Games."" A great explanation on the value of understanding positive-sum games.11. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein's ""Inference to the Best Explanation."" One of the best essays of the book. Explains what is behind the power of science.12. Donald Hoffman's ""Our Sensory Desktop."" The importance of refining our attitude toward our own perceptions.13. Michael Shermer's ""Think Bottom Up, Not Top Down."" Great explanation on emerging properties.14. Terrence Sejnowski's ""Powers of 10."" How to think about things in the world over a wide range of magnitudes and time scales.15. Guilio Boccaletti's ""Scale Analysis."" Understanding this concept can help us on many complex problems.16. Sam Harris's ""We are Lost in Thought."" The distorted views of the self.17. Sue Blackmore's ""Correlation is not a Cause."" The need to spread this concept to the public.18. Lee Smolin's ""Thinking in Time Versus Thinking Outside of Time."" Important and very little discussed topic, it's about time.19. Geoffrey Miller's ""The Personality/Insanity Continuum."" Very interesting topic.20. Mathew Ritchie's ""Systematic Equilibrium."" The second of thermodynamics applied.21. Mark Henderson's ""Science Methods Aren't Just for Science."" Solid defense of science.22. Scott D. Sampson's ""Interbeing."" Another one of my favorites.23. Satyajit Das's ""Parallelism in Art and Commerce."" A unique contribution.24. Vinod Khosla's ""Black Swan Technologies."" Low probability events with extreme impact.25. Fiery Cushman's ""Understanding Confabulation."" Understanding our own behavior.Negatives:1. Some essays were not worthy of this book. It's not my intent to denigrate any of these great minds so I'm not going to mention them by name. Thankfully just a few received zero or one stars.2. Some of my favorite authors let me down while others flourished.3. It requires an investment of time.In summary, I enjoy these kinds of books. The Edge does a wonderful job of selecting a thought-provoking question and an even better job of bringing in intellectuals from a wide range of fields to answer it. The search for knowledge is a fun and satisfying pursuit. Pick up this book and enjoy the ride.Further suggestions: ""This Explains Everything: Deep, Beautiful, and Elegant Theories of How the World Works"" by John Brockman, ""A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"" by Lawrence Krauss, ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" by Richard Dawkins, ""The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements"" by Sam Kean, ""The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human"" by V.S.

The perspectives of the essays are ranging from biology, sociology, astronomy, technology, all the way to psychology. Personally, during the first tens pages of the book, I enjoyed cramming the new information into my thought, but I must admit that the further I read, the more challenging it became; it's not because those answers are uninformative or boring, but because they seemed not to catch my interest since my poor brain couldn't comprehend those words. However, the book still provides me some considerable ideas to improve my future thinking skill. Finally, I will leave you with a small part of Michael Shermer's essay titled ""Think Bottom Up, Not Top Down"":Most people, however, see the world from the top down instead of the bottom up. The reason is that our brains evolved to find design in the world, and our experience with designed objects is that they have a designer (us), whom we consider to be intelligent. So most people intuitively sense that anything in nature that looks designed must be so from the top down, not the bottom up. Bottom-up reasoning is counterintuitive. This is why so many people believe that life was designed from the top down, and why so many think that economies must be designed and that countries should be ruled from the top down."
15,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"This is a small-plates restaurant for the brain. More than 150 of today’s top thinkers from many different fields answer a simple question: What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkit? “Scientific” includes any endeavor that seeks analytical knowledge and understanding. Each dish runs anything from one to four pages. Occasionally I could gobble up ten in a sitting, but often one would be so delicious and filling that I would need to stop reading and ponder its ramifications.The editor implicitly grouped the pieces by similarity, but he must have had a hard time deciding which went best with which others because of the wealth of interconnections amongst them. You may not agree with some answers, and others may seem trivial rather than crucial, but that’s part of the culinary value: you have to taste, judge, test the recipe in your own kitchen, and decide what other dishes best complement it.Okay, I’m stretching this restaurant metaphor beyond the bounds of good taste. But nibble on one or two samples from the book in a bookstore or Amazon’s “look inside.” See if your brain doesn’t burp and ask for more."

17,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5539620-dorum,3,"I Liked this book. It did contain some useful new notions. Unfortunately it also contains a lot of repetition and also some platitudes. In the end I expected as much. After all, it is more like cookbook. Not every recipe in it needs to be according to my dad tastes.That being said, here are some concepts which I found really interesting:- Deep Time - the Universe has a huge time span. People are aware (those who are not creationists) how long ago it was created, but it will exist for an even longer time, and this is not really permeated in our culture)- Nexus Causality - if an apple falls of the tree, people will generally attribute a single cause. For example ""it fell down because it was ripe"". This is a problem because we generally think in ""single cause -> single effect"" manner. A better way would be to think of a nexus of causality (it was very heavy, it was ripe, it was that time of the year, the wind was blowing, etc.). Even if the apple was ripe, that generally doesn't explain why other ripe apple didn't fall. Using this ""Nexus Causality"" way of thinking can be useful. It would be especially useful in really complex systems (economic, social, etc.) for avoiding the moral blame game.- Focusing Illusion - When you focus on a thing, you tend to ignore a lot of myriad other things. Sounds simple, right? Let us do a test. Education is one of the most important factors for determining the income. However, did you know that if everyone had THE SAME education, inequality of income would be reduced by less than 10 percent? Incredible, right? You would expect that if some low income dead end job person would have the same education as that bank CEO, and the same education as Stephen Hawking, their incomes would surely become more averaged out, right? Well... no, because you are focusing on education and ignoring the rest. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. And THAT is why you are fooled by advertising.- Nominal fallacy - the error of believing that naming carries explanatory information. (There is a difference between knowing ABOUT something and actually knowing something). This was one of the first times that I met this word. I am sick and tired of people attributing some behavioural pattern to ""culture"" or ""education"" or ""instinct"" any other catch all phrase. It is lazy from an intellectual point of view. - People are really bad at probabilities - Example: At Rockefeller University women are only two-thirds as likely as male applicants to be admitted. There was a gender discrimination lawsuit. However, upon serious inspection, it was discovered that in each department, women are MORE likely to be admitted than men. Can you explain how this is possible? :) If not, perhaps you would benefit from a course in statistics.- Shifting Baseline Syndrome- Baselines - (I knew about this from Kahnemann, but I think it is really a useful concept that should be familiar to more people and SHOULD enter in common language).- PERMA - A measurement of well being - Structured Serendipity- Pragmamorphism (this describes a concept that I noticed a lot, but I never had a useful label for it)- Externalities- Umwelt and Umgebung- Culture Cycle (they are not what you think!)- Cultural Attractors- Scale Analysis (this is really useful)- Hidden Layers (analogy to neural networks)- Anthropocene Thinking - Findex - The degree to which a desired piece of information can be found online- Path Dependence- The Gibbs Energy Landscape (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_...)- Kakonomics -“Kakonomics is the strange yet widespread preference for mediocre exchanges insofar as nobody complains about them. Kakonomic worlds are worlds in which people not only live with one another’s laxness but expect it: I trust you not to keep your promises in full because I want to be free not to keep mine and not to feel bad about it. ”- Time Span of Discretion - REALLY USEFUL! WORK ON INCREASING IT!- Phase Transition and Scale Transition (first one is from physics, second one is invented by the author BUT SORELY NEEDED!)- Statistically Significant DOES NOT MEAN Significant! - Why some scientists really think (with good reasons) that the term ""statistically significant"" should be changed or not used anymore. What it means, and how does it differ from ""significant"". Let me give you a taste for this one: ""Drug A was statistically significantly different from placebo. Drug B was NOT statistically significantly different from placebo. HOWEVER, Drug A and Drug B are not statistically significantly different from each other."" If you think that this is strange, or impossible, you should read the book.There are many other ideas. So while I cannot give this book more than 3 stars, because a lot of useless fluff, some concepts were really useful to me, and I learned quite a lot."
18,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57729622-deepak-jaisinghani,2,"This book is not unlike a short-stories book. Short-story books have always been a case of hit-or-miss for me. And so was this book.The overarching theme of the book is this: Which scientific concept can improve everyone's cognitive toolkit? Various prominent scientists, almost all of whom are authors in their specialized fields of expertise, including the likes of Daniel Kahneman, Steven Pinker, Clifford Pickover and Jonathan Haidt, proceed to answer the question what they think is the 'best' cognitive tool.Some essays are absurdly long, unnecessarily detailed and filled with scientific jargon, while some consist of just a couple paragraphs, spelling the concept but explaining nothing at all. You forget them as soon as you turn the page. Some were worth rereading, while most of them did not move me at all. John Brockman's work as editor is not satisfactory; it seems to me that he just compiled all the submissions without sparing a thought as to which ones are truly worth our attention and which ones should better be left out.If you are a connoisseur of anything science, pick up something more concrete, lucid and empirical. This one would simply not suffice to satiate your curiosity."

Weh?Well, if knowing the words Copernican principle, gedankenexperiment, or nexus causality will make you sound smarter, er, smarter, then grab it. The book offers a wide array of answers to the Edge Question 2011: ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?""The essays are grouped topically. Two flaws of putting into a book a number of different field specialists: (1) some authors basically repeat what the other authors have said (2) some authors contradict what the other authors have said.The book is also reflective of what is there in the current scene of modern science, philosophy, and psychology. Most authors, instead of giving a straight answer for the question, used this as a platform for their ideas such as P. Z. Myers' ""man as an accident,"" Sean Carroll's ""pointless universe,"" Richard Dawkins' ""use of experimentation,"" and Lawrence Krauss' ""uncertainty principle."" In the quest for improving our cognitive toolkit, an author suggested that we should remind ourselves that ""each of us is standard issue, conceived by the union of two germ cells, nurtured in a womb, and equipped with a developmental program that guides our further maturation and eventual decline."" An author even surmised that we should be called ""Homo dilatus,"" or the procrastinating ape. Ha!I appreciate some of authors who really got into the heart of the matter. The discussion about the focusing illusion (Daniel Kahneman) and shorthand abstraction (Richard Nisbett) gave me that ""aha"" moment. I find Nicholas Carr's essay on cognitive load very practical. ""The amount of information entering our consciousness at any instant is referred to as our cognitive load. When our cognitive load exceeds the capacity of our working memory, our intellectual abilities take a hit. Information zips into and out of our mind so quickly that we never gain a good mental grip on it. The information vanishes before we've had an opportunity to transfer it into our long-term memory and weave it into knowledge."" His solution? Monitor and manage your cognitive load. Turn the info faucet down to a trickle. Somewhat, this book is worth the time..."

There were several discussions about the asymmetrical nature of top-down and bottom-up manners of investigation, the subjectivity of observation, the need for replicability, the imperfect but well-intentioned nature of the scientific method, the tendency we have as humans to attribute one cause to one effect when the two are only correlated or there are other causes at work, the fact that being human skews our ability to perceive the world in an objective way, and science is never sure of anything, etc. I consider this type of answer to be only relevant to people that deal with theory-theory on a regular basis: i.e. scientists. To be fair there were some other answers that were practical. Self-serving bias, the high probability that you are mediocre in most pursuits, the fact that you are 90% microbe mass, that our memories malleable and reconstructive most of the time (eye-witness testimony is VERY unreliable), that language and technology formats biases the way you think, that heaven is not a place you would actually want to go (you would be hopelessly bored), you can't prove that something is safe (or that something won't happen), that winning doesn't feel as good as losing hurts, and that the struggle for existence is more of a SNUGGLE for existence (he who mates first propagates and is the one who is more fit in Natural Selection).Overall, there are some gems worth reading about in this book, but you have to pick through a lot of theory-theory in order to do so. I was hoping for some life-hacks, and what I got was some scientists complaining about other scientists. :( It does make a good bathroom reader, though."

This is a book to be read in short bursts and digested. Since most of the 'chapters' are from one to three pages in length, that's easy. You will definitely want to savor each, since they can really challenge your assumptions, and give you a lot to consider.The speakers/writers are notable scientists and thinkers and their ideas range from changes in national policy to simple things the individual can do to simply change the way they approach new - and possibly challenging - information.I think this book is very accessible and should be in every family's library - virtual or otherwise. And, I particularly wanted to mention that this is a book that could benefit students and kids from the age of 12 and up. "
22,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118597-karl-nordstrom,3,"This book has a pretentious title. I prefer the original question: ""What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkit?"" A long list of deep thinkers were asked this question and they each provide a brief answer in this book. If you would like to read it for free, you can find their answers on Edge.org under the title of the original question.The book is pretty interesting. If you're already a scientific thinker, then you will be familiar with many of the ideas. I found it to be worth reading for the handful of ideas that were not familiar to me. The first answer in the book is, perhaps, the most enlightening: Nothing In Life Is As Important As You Think It Is, While You Are Thinking About It."
23,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/143011-z,5,"I am proud of myself that I already knew many of these scientific concepts, thanks to intense reading and audiobooking over the course of years...but I also felt humbled by how much I didn't know, or didn't completely understand...the wonderful thing about this book is that it is comprised of short essays, so the sheer volume of thought-provoking knowledge does not become overwhelming... The vast majority of the essays are VERY accessible, and each one could be a spur for much further research. I think this book could be used as a sort of secular devotional, reading one of the short essays each day...or as a conversation/essay prompt for English, science, or social studies classes..."
24,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,3,"I guess I expected too much from this book, given its not so humble title. The selection of topics is okay. But if you've been into the science blogosphere and/or TED for a while you will probably be familiar with most of the ideas presented in the book already. The essays are all really short, most are not longer than a typical blogpost. For many topics a bit more background to the ideas would have been a good thing. If you want a crash course in modern scientific ideas (without actually learning much besides the general existence of those ideas) the book may be nice. Otherwise you can safely skip this one. "
25,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,To read my review in my Spanish blog; click here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com/2...There more than 150 bits of very valuable knowledge in this book. There are reflections on time; space science; physics; ethics; death; knowledge; learning; perspective; perception; etc. I liked that every articla was maximum two pages; and that the authors of each article made a real effort to be as clear as possible. I would like to have read a book with more quality in the printing or the quality of the paper; because that would make me have a stronger desire to have it on my shelf; but it is definitely worth a reading.
26,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,2,The book is a collection of articles written by scientists who explain how to improve our cognitive toolkits. Rather than improve my cognitive tool kit I just want to point out what I found of interest in the book. Strangers apparently find people more likable and form good first impressions if they are holding a cup of hot coffee. Rainy weather makes us introspective and thoughtful which improves our memory. It also drives down the stock market which loves sunny days.A salient point in the book is the fact that “Change is the law” in our lives. Stability and consistency are only illusions. The book was alright however it didn’t motivate me to want to pick it up and read.
27,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95878161-ardon-pillay,4,"This book is nothing short of fantastic. It’s a compendium of essays written in response to the question, “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive tool-kit?” The essays in the book are all very varied and touch upon such diverse fields of knowledge, from anthropology to quantum mechanics. Interestingly, the content in these essays isn’t particularly complex; they mainly feature short hand abstractions that just help us to make sense of the world around us. My favourite essays in this were “The Senses and the Multisensory,” “The Umwelt,” “Nexus Causality,” and “Einstein’s Blade in Occam’s Razor.”"
28,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8389525-alicia,3,"This book did make me smarter, but then again... Don't all books do that in some way? Overall, the essays were well organized and flowed from one topic to the next. The book was DEFINITELY elitist, and some of the essays were so condescending to nonscientists that they made me wonder if the authors were living in a bubble. There were some fantastic essays too, and I think the book could have been shortened to focus on those ideas.Major focuses: using data in everyday life, how your brain works, evolution, cause and effect"
29,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2194449-becky-roper,2,"I'm not sure what I was hoping for here, but this was a collection of very short pieces by a variety of authors, mostly scientific experts of one kind or another. They each give a short description of a concept they feel could make you think better. Since the authros are almost exclusively academics, the ideas they share are long on concepts but very short on practical application. A few were too obtuse to even comprehend, and a few others were quite thought-provoking. All in all it was a long way to go for a few new ways to look at how you see things and make decisions. "

I recommend for anyone with background in sciences or those who likes sciences overall.It is a very good read for short periods of waiting, like my daily ~12 minute ride on the subway, when I could read ~2 essays per ride.Not every essay is good, but most of them were good enough. About 40 of them are top notch and marked for future rereading. My favorite on was Kakonomics by Gloria Origgi."

But I certainly dug a little deeper into the depths of my ignorance. There are several nice things about the book. 1. It is a keeper. I think I will re-read it once every few years. 2. It makes you think. I have 100 topics to research and learn more.3. It is packaged to be consumed in small bites - about 153 essays from almost as many thinkersI took a lot of notes. Perhaps I will share some of my favorite parts some day. P.S: I read the audio version. So read a few chapters, paused for a while and came back to consume more. "
36,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5943454-heidi-thorsen,3,"This seemed pretty academic to me. Each essay addressed some concept the scientists/writers/authors wanted the masses to be more aware of. Some essays enlightened me, pointing out in persuasive ways how my intuition might be failing me, other essays I failed to be persuaded to change my outlook. I’m not sorry I took the time to read it all, but I’m only going to recommend it to folks who already read a lot and have room for a little extra. "

But, because we don't recognize this, we fail to understand that we need to reason logically from evidence we gather, carefully consider the conditions under which our experiment has been conducted, and decide when and how we might run the experiment again with better results. The scientific activity that surrounds experimentation is about thinking clearly in the face of evidence obtained from the experiment.""""Each of us is ordinary, yet one of a kind. - Embracing these two aspects of our personal reality can enrich our daily experience.

The very same principle seems to be true in your own life: If you wish to flourish personally, getting rid of depression, anxiety, and anger and amassing riches is not enough- you also need to build PERMA directly.""""Creativity is a fragile flower, but perhaps it can be fertilized with systematic doses of serendipity. --As a layman and an amateur, all I hope to accomplish by throwing myself in serendipity's path is to pick up new ideas, and combine old ones, in ways that haven't quite occurred to other people yet. So I let my curiosity lead me wherever it seems to want to go...--In my view, we should each invest a few hours a week in reading research that ostensibly has nothing to do with our day jobs, in a setting that has nothing to do with our daily jobs, in a setting that has nothing in common with our regular workspaces. This kind of structured serendipity just might help us become more creative, and I doubt that it can hurt.""""'We have to remember what it is we are to concentrate on' Lose your hold on that and you'll find 'distractions more distracting.-- The resulting sense of connectedness and stimulation can be exciting and pleasurable. But it's important to remember that when it comes to the way your brain works, information overload is not just a metaphor, it's a physical state.

They don't expect to get a good solution; they keep working until they've found something that's good enough. They're never convinced they know enough to solve the problem, so they're constantly testing their ideas on different stakeholders.""""How could we use design thinking to change the way we think? Good design typically begins with some principles and functional objectives.

But science should settle policy.""""Science is both of these things, yet as Carl Sagan so memorably explained in The Demon-Haunted World, it is something else besides. It is a way of thinking, the best approach yet devised (if still an imperfect one) for discovering progressively better approximations of how things really are.--Science is provisional, always open to revision in light of new evidence. It is antiauthoritarian: Anybody can contribute, and anybody can be wrong. It tests actively to test its propositions. And it is comfortable with uncertainty...""""If science can help us to understand the first microseconds of creation and the structure of the ribosome, it can surely improve understanding of how best to tackle the pressing social questions of our time.""""Path dependence refers to the fact that often something that seems normal or inevitable today began with a choice that made sense at a particular time in the past but survived despite the eclipse of its justification, because, once it had been established, external factors discouraged going into reverse to try other alternatives.--For one thing, that the present is based on a dynamic mixture of extant and ancient conditions is simply more interesting than the assuming that the present is (mostly) all there is, with history as merely 'past', interesting only for seeing whether something that happened then could now happen again-which is different from path dependence.""""We can separate our 'entangled buddies' as far as we can, and they will remain entangled. A change in one is instantly reflected in the other, even though they are physically far apart (and I mean in different countries!).""""We modern humans taxonomically define ourselves as Homo Sapiens sapiens, wise wise beings. Apparently we can dominate natural forces, be they instincts, viruses or storms. However we cannot avoid destroying natural resources while consuming more than we need. We cannot control excessive ambition. We cannot avoid surrendering to the power of sex or money.

We run when we feel a threat, not because of rational planning but automatically.--For most of us, the admonition 'Don't panic' works only when we;re not panicking.""""Automatic behaviours can be remarkably organized and even goal driven. For example, research shows that people tend to cheat only as much as they can without realizing they're cheating. --These are just incomplete explanations, confabulations that reflect our conscious thoughts while ignoring the unconscious ones.""""Perhaps you've noticed that people have an easier time sniffing out unseemly motivations for others' behaviour than recognizing the same motivations for their own behaviour. .... By understanding confabulation, we can begin to remedy both faults. We can hold others responsible for their behaviour without necessarily impugning their conscious motivations. And we can hold ourselves more responsible by inspecting our own behaviour for its unconscious influences, as unseen as they are unwanted.""""The Buddha advised: 'When you know for yourselves...these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to well being and happiness - then live and act accordingly."" --See for yourself' is an unspoken credo of science. It is not enough to run an experiment and report the findings.

39,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,4,"Found this great review online: sums it up well:The first time you pick up ""This Will Make You Smarter,"" you might be put off by the brash title and ostentatious red cover.The premise of the whole thing just feels a bit too presumptuous. The book will make you smarter? Just by reading it? Really? You're just supposed to absorb the knowledge, through some sort of mental osmosis? Will completing the book transform you into some sort of enlightened being?""This Will Make You Smarter."" That's one hell of a guarantee.But if you were put off by ""This Will Make You Smarter's"" audaciousness, then you'd be falling prey to exactly the kind of poor thinking the book aims to correct. You'd be judging it by its cover.And that is a problem.Because ""This Will Make You Smarter"" might just be the most brilliantly, profoundly, intellectually challenging book you'll ever read. It takes your mind to some extraordinary places, challenging your imagination with ideas that can and will take your breath away.The book comprises a series of essays by some of the world's greatest scientists, philosophers and playwrights, all of whom are directly answering one simple question: ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?""Their answers come from the cutting edge of psychology, philosophy, economics, physics, sociology, biology and many more fields too complicated to mention here. These are people who live at the outermost frontiers of human knowledge -- thinkers who spend their lives using what we do know to discover what we don't. Their words are inspiring, comforting and occasionally alarming. Their wisdom is great. But their tone is never arrogant or elitist.The book was edited by John Brockman, author and founder of Edge -- an organization which aims ""to arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves."" He should be commended for managing to make intellectual prowess accessible to all.Academia's ivory towers can be daunting, but what ""This Will Make You Smarter"" shows us is that the minds that inhabit them are not egotistic or self-important. These minds are as humble as they are nimble. They are generous but refreshingly frank. These minds search for answers about our universe -- answers that one day might benefit us all.Writing a review about the ideas of such impressive people is intimidating. The words on the pages of ""This Will Make You Smarter"" carry much more authority than the words on this screen, but if you've gleaned anything from reading this, it's that this is a genuinely important book. If your mind is a curious one, if you've ever wondered about the nature of our universe, our existence, or our collective and individual selves, than you should read it. It's just that good.Our world is one cleaved by conflict and paralyzed by politics. It is full of suffering -- suffering that isn't necessarily avoidable, but might be addressed better if we approached society's problems with scientific rigor instead of irrational dogmatism and ideological grandstanding. The stories told by our popular media frequently portray our species as violent, ignorant and ugly. ""This Will Make You Smarter"" shows us that we humans can also be beautifully, divinely wise. Because despite what the world's dominant religions might tell you, empirically speaking, we are all just collections of atoms that just happened to have gained self-consciousness.All of the thinkers featured in ""This Will Make You Smarter"" wrote their essays individually. Remarkably, Brockman has managed to arrange them in such a way that a narrative of sorts appears. This is very much a story -- the story of the human condition, told from the scientific perspective. By the time you've finished This Will Make You Smarter, you won't view it as an ostentatious red book. You'll view it as an old friend.And you will be smarter, whether you like it or not. "
40,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85649072-investingbythebooks-com,4,"This book belongs firmly in the surrounding knowledge category, which I suspect to most readers of InvestingByTheBooks is a category we turn to after all of the “real” book titles have been exhausted. Expanding one’s horizons is important I believe. In the words of Charlie Munger “In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time - none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads - at how much I read...”This Will Make You Smarter with its catchy title, is a pantheon of interesting insights and ideas that will satisfy even the most intellectually curious amongst us. The book does what it says on the tin. It is both a formidable compilation to have on the shelf and a good read. I like to pick it up from time to time to absorb some random insight from the world of biology, physics or neuroscience.The editor (there are 151 authors) is John Brockman. Brockman is a literary agent and an impresario and he created the website called Edge.org. If you take away just one thing from this review, let it be a visit to this website. Edge.org was launched in 1996 as a modern day version of the Bloomsbury Group, or ""The Reality Club,"" an informal gathering of intellectuals to share ideas and theories. In the words of the novelist Ian McEwan, Edge.org is ""open-minded, free ranging, intellectually playful ... an unadorned pleasure in curiosity...” Each year Edge publishes a book by posing a thought provoking question. The contents of these books contain the answers to the question from its erudite members. Through the years I have purchased and read most of these books. My favorite is the 2012 edition of the Edge question.In 2012 the question was “What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody’s Cognitive Toolkit?” or to paraphrase: if you, Mr(s) prominent scientist can offer your average person with one insight, one rule of thumb from the world of theoretical science that you think they ought to know, what would it be? The answers are far and varied but most are rooted in a branch of science. The essays range from a single paragraph in length to 4 pages and cover a total of 151 topics by as many authors. The members of Edge that have written for the book read as a who’s who in science across multiple disciplines. They include Steven Pinker, Daniel Kahneman, Richard Dawkins, Matt Ridley, Daniel Dennett as well as practitioners such as Paul Kedrosky and Vinod Khosla. There are too many entries to list, but I have some favorites. Kahneman writes about the Focusing Illusion i.e. “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it”. Ridley, the author of the Rational Optimist writes about Collective Intelligence highlighting the fact that human achievement is entirely a networking phenomenon driven by the forces of specialization and trade. James O’Donnek’s essay is entitled “Everything is in Motion” and quotes Heraclitus “You can’t step in the same river twice”.As a collection of essays the book lacks some structure. The entries appear in no particular order. There’s no ranking by status of the author for instance nor are there specific sections or chapters. Having read it a few times now, I noticed there is a grouping in that entries that cover a specific topic or theme such as randomness, “emergence” or the limits of human cognition, tend to go together. The lack of structure is also appealing; you can randomly flick through it and read an entry without having to read what came before to understand it.To the investor, intellectual curiosity and knowledge building are a necessity. This book if anything, highlights how little we know, and that the smartest people tend to be the ones often least convinced of their knowledge."
41,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8715301-nderson,4,"I chose to read this book attracted by the proposed methodology. The editor poses a question: ""What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody’s Cognitive Toolkit?"" And then all kind of scholars offer a response in the form of short articles. I was very enthusiastic when I began reading but then I realized the book was much longer than I thought (over 400 pages including notes and an index -useless in electronic edition by the way). Nevertheless I continued reading looking forward to seeing the answers that would be given to such an interesting question.The book has at least two essential characteristics. (1) It is an interdisciplinary book: This is reflected in the different essays of the book. Some are structurally complex whereas others are so short and spontaneous that they touch the border of poetry. This is good for the reader can always be expectant of what will come next. Yet it may also seem frustrating at times since it may disrupt the flow of the book and some articles are really low quality in comparison to others.(2) This is a scientific book: writers made their essays from the perspective of a scientist and even those short reflexive articles affirm so. This obviously mean that there is a plethora of new words to learn and it is advisable for the reader to have a dictionary at hand. Moreover, it is not seldom that authors make up their own words and turn the terms into the center of their reflection. As a studious person with a scientific inclination this characteristic compelled to me and I found most of the essays amusing. Nevertheless, my great objection to the book is the attitude of the writers. All throughout the book there is this feeling of using science as something to boast about. As a matter of fact many of the articles get annoying when some of the writers refer to anything out of their scientific world as less important and even something they can make fun of. Sarcasm is abundant and direct or indirect attacks to religious beliefs are found all throughout the book, with just a few exceptions. Though this proud attitude speaks more of the contributors as persons than of their disciplines, it made me consider to drop the book several times. It is paradoxical how people as smart as the writers in this book can fall victim of simplistic stereotypes labeling everyone outside of their intellectual sphere as less than them. This disdain is not only for religious people but also for people in the humanities and occasionally for those who belong to a different branch of science.Lastly, I feel that it would be more productive to read this book along one whole years (maybe a couple essays per day) rather than as your main reading. That would offer more time for reflection and process of the ideas presented and minimize the reader's ability to perceive the negative things I perceived by reading it at once.In conclusion, the title of the book makes an offer that should warn the reader of the embedded presupposition. The book offers to make you smarter because most of the writers consider that they are smarter than you and they are not slow to brag about it. In spite of this, many of the ideas are really thought-provoking and for a reader who is able to take what is good and ignore the rest this may be an enriching reading."

Leading scientists, psychologists, writers and general advanced ""thinkers"" responded with the short answers that make up This Will Make You Smarter, and the result is indeed thought-provoking, but not always interesting.However, the most interesting portion, to me, is that this was published before the self-plagiarizing/Bob Dylan quote fabrication scandal of Jonah Lehrer. Lehrer's contribution to this book, ""Control Your Spotlight,"" has to do with a study conducted with small children. The children were in a room with a bowl of marshmallows and told that if they could wait a short period of time alone, they could have more than one to eat. The study looked at impulse control, mainly, and the children who were better able to resist taking a marshmallow early were the ones who put their attention elsewhere. Some kids sang songs, others covered their eyes, etc. But what I find rather amusing is this bit from Lehrer:Willpower is really about properly diverting the spotlight of attention, learning how to control that short list of thoughts in working memory. It's about realizing that if we're thinking about the marshmallow, we're going to eat it, which is why we need to look away.So, am I to understand that he gambled on the working memory of Bob Dylan fans, and hoped that they were looking at other things when he made up those quotes? That's a pretty big gamble, that spotlight ""control."" He didn't have the smarts suggested in David G. Myers' contributing essay, ""Self-Serving Bias:""Being mindful of self-serving bias beckons us not to false modesty but to a humility that affirms our genuine talents and virtues and likewise those of others.In other words, work with what you've got, and work it well. Don't be a self-serving jerk who tries to make his book better with fake quotes. Also, never underestimate a music super-fan’s skills.(My full review appears at Glorified Love Letters.)"
44,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3074982-keith,3," This book is a collection of essays that are 2 or 3 pages long. The first few essays contend that we are not unique in the universe. A couple of them tell us that microbes dominate the earth and also the human body.  Several of them seemed to be way behind the times for example. (1) The Copernican Principle harks back to the 1800's when science believed that the universe was deterministic. This author seems unaware that quantum mechanics showed the deterministic viewpoint as being inadequate. (Page 11) (2) ""Experimentation"" seems to advocate changing only one variable at a time. That is a terribly inefficient method of studying complex phenomena. The author of this section ignores the power of Design of Experiments, which is a powerful method of narrowing down what matters and what doesn't when there are lots of possible causes. (Page 23) (3) The next essay glorifies experimentation: The Controlled Experiment advocates the value of controlled experimentation instead of ""instinct or partially informed debate."" (4) That is followed by an article advocating Thought experiments. (Since that is pretty much the opposite of the previous essay, perhaps there is something for everyone in this book of essays.) ""The (Thought Experiment) was particularly important during the development of quantum mechanics,"" His favorite is Galileo's (thought experiment) proof that ... Aristotle was wrong. (Page 28) The Pessimistic Meta-Induction from the History of Science article was more fun. ""Because so many scientific theories from bygone eras have turned out to be wrong, we must assume that most of today's theories will eventually prove incorrect as well."" (Page 30) ""knowledge collapses apparently as fast as it accretes, that our own most cherished beliefs might appear patently false to posterity. ... If, by contrast, you think that uncovering your mistakes is one of the best ways to revise and improve your understand of the world, then this is actually a highly optimistic insight."" (Page 31)"

Ramachandran, Richard Dawkins, Sean Carroll, Kevin Kelly, Rudy Rucker, David Eagleman, Sam Harris - each presenting what serves as their answer to the 2012 Edge.org question: ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?""In the hitlist of answers: Advocating for uncertainty. Carlo Rovelli writes ""The very foundation of science is to keep the door open to doubt. Precisely because we keep questioning everything, especially our own premises, we are always ready to improve our knowledge."" Several articles declare it is important to educate the public on probability values, to avoid ridiculous scares that are fuelled by misunderstandings of numbers (see vaccines, airport security scanners, ..). Top of the list are definitely also the issues concerning climate control, and how facts can be misinterpreted. In total there are lots of stabs on the general uneducated state of most Americans. And at societies stubborn preference for mediocrity instead of finding win-win situation through collaboration and compromise. I especially enjoyed:- David Eagleman's ""The Umwelt"" which talks about the limits of our senses and how each organism assumes its umwelt to be the entire objective reality out there. - Lee Smolin's ""Thinking in Time versus thinking outside of Time"" where he advocates for a perspective of truth where the ultimate truth doesn't lie outside our universe but within. In that way objects and ideas only exist once they are invented. Every feature of them is a result of their history and everything about them is negotiable and subject to improvement by the invention of novel ways of doing things. - Amanda Gefter's ""Dualities"" which talks about how we should sometimes replace our typically boolean thinking and embrace the scientific concept of dualities instead, that radically different theories can both be true and represent the same underlying reality.

Beware of anecdotes, they may be exceptional but they are not the rule. Don't generalise from them.4. If you must study exceptions, take note of its factors and circumstances.5. Science is a way of thinking.6. Be wary of the terms you use, it can mislead others.7. When you're not sure, don't say it.8. Science is anti-authoritarian so don't act like an authority figure when sharing knowledge.9. Teaching is a gift and service and not as a bastion of authority.10. Uncertainty is good. It is not dangerous. It gives us responsibility.11. Beware of base rates and don't solely base your decisions on them. (e.g. not taking a flight because of an unlikely chance of being killed by a terrorist)12. Let go of mind sets that aren't useful.13. Let go of theories that aren't useful.14.

The common thread seemed to be that we are led astray by modes of thinking and perceiving that come out of our genetic and cultural heritage and that may have been useful when our ancestors were first climbing down out of the trees, but which can lead us in the wrong direction when we are trying to solve modern scientific and social problems, so our instinctual modes of thought need to be replaced by a rigorous application of principles of scientific reasoning. It is a fair observation, but it is sometimes a little tedious to see it repeated endlessly in slightly different form in dozens of short essays. There are other ideas here too, but the book seems to continuously circle back to this central theme.One of the interesting things about this book was the editorial choice in the order of the essays. Adjacent essays tended to have similar themes and linking concepts. This helped to make the ideas more memorable, and made the book more fun to read.The best essays in the book are not necessarily by the most famous people, and none of the writers are anywhere close to the level of my favorite essayist, Montaigne, but there was some stuff to think about here, and I. The end of the day, it is hard to ask more from a book than that."

I'd not heard of this organization before, but will check out some of their other collections. As a layperson, the concepts didn't go over my head, and the essays were short enough to hold the reader's attention, while providing a fairly comprehensive overview of each subject/concept. The ratings I'd give the individual essays themselves vary 3/5 to 5/5. I'm intrigued to see what other intriguing questions are posed in this series. "

Gould described intelligence as a vernacular term that describes a wide variety of abilities propensities and interests none of which are very closely related to most of the others. If that is the case then it is hard or even impossible to measure smartness so that we can tell if someone has gotten smarter. What this book does do, though, is to teach you to think scientifically. That is, it teaches you to think scientifically if you are willing to learn to think scientifically. I have met all too many people who just reject not only learning to think rationally, but also reject learning what rationality even is. However, science is the study of reality and everything we want is gotten only by manipulating reality and the closer we can come to understanding what reality actually is the more efficiently can we manipulate it to our liking. That means that learning to think scientifically is a great benefit to all of us, both individually and collectively. If you learn to think scientifically and act accordingly then you will be acting in a way that can be said to be -- to use a vernacular term -- smarter. This book is well worth reading."

As a side note, despite minor overlap, there are literally 150 different concepts in this book, which is rather amazing, even considering how vast the areas of expertise are (archaeology, psychology, physics, art, computer science, biology, chemistry, sociology, philosophy, etc.). One would think that some would stand out more than others?My favourite article was Richard Thaler's Aether. And I like anything about bias and fallacy. However, I'd say most of them are merely ok.

The result is a collection of short essays answering that question. Past questions have included “What do you believe but cannot prove?”, “ What have you changed your mind about?”, and my favorite so far, “What are you optimistic about?” The question that spawned this book was “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkit?” Like most of these Edge books there were a few answers that were thinly veiled screeds against religion, but for the most part, the answers were pretty good. They included things like the Pareto Principle (aka the 80-20 rule), the idea of positive-sum games, that you can demonstrate danger but cannot demonstrate safety, that correlation is not causation, and black swan technologies. There are about 150 in all, and they give good food for thought. My recommendation is to read this a little bit at a time, perhaps an answer or two each day.

Some of these responses seem to ignore the question entirely, using this exercise as a vehicle for talking about their current pet research question or to write about a pet peeve loosely related to science and society. Some of the responses display a condescending tone and lack of understanding of non-academics and non-scientists that nicely illustrates the tradeoffs that specialization carries for society and its experts.

Apparently we can dominate natural forces, be they instincts, viruses or storms. However we cannot avoid destroying natural resources while consuming more than we need.

For example, research shows that people tend to cheat only as much as they can without realizing they're cheating. --These are just incomplete explanations, confabulations that reflect our conscious thoughts while ignoring the unconscious ones.""""Perhaps you've noticed that people have an easier time sniffing out unseemly motivations for others' behaviour than recognizing the same motivations for their own behaviour. .... By understanding confabulation, we can begin to remedy both faults. We can hold others responsible for their behaviour without necessarily impugning their conscious motivations. And we can hold ourselves more responsible by inspecting our own behaviour for its unconscious influences, as unseen as they are unwanted.""""The Buddha advised: 'When you know for yourselves...these things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to well being and happiness - then live and act accordingly."" --See for yourself' is an unspoken credo of science.

69,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,4,"Found this great review online: sums it up well:The first time you pick up ""This Will Make You Smarter,"" you might be put off by the brash title and ostentatious red cover.The premise of the whole thing just feels a bit too presumptuous. The book will make you smarter? Just by reading it? Really? You're just supposed to absorb the knowledge, through some sort of mental osmosis? Will completing the book transform you into some sort of enlightened being?""This Will Make You Smarter."" That's one hell of a guarantee.But if you were put off by ""This Will Make You Smarter's"" audaciousness, then you'd be falling prey to exactly the kind of poor thinking the book aims to correct. You'd be judging it by its cover.And that is a problem.Because ""This Will Make You Smarter"" might just be the most brilliantly, profoundly, intellectually challenging book you'll ever read. It takes your mind to some extraordinary places, challenging your imagination with ideas that can and will take your breath away.The book comprises a series of essays by some of the world's greatest scientists, philosophers and playwrights, all of whom are directly answering one simple question: ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?""Their answers come from the cutting edge of psychology, philosophy, economics, physics, sociology, biology and many more fields too complicated to mention here. These are people who live at the outermost frontiers of human knowledge -- thinkers who spend their lives using what we do know to discover what we don't. Their words are inspiring, comforting and occasionally alarming. Their wisdom is great. But their tone is never arrogant or elitist.The book was edited by John Brockman, author and founder of Edge -- an organization which aims ""to arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves."" He should be commended for managing to make intellectual prowess accessible to all.Academia's ivory towers can be daunting, but what ""This Will Make You Smarter"" shows us is that the minds that inhabit them are not egotistic or self-important. These minds are as humble as they are nimble. They are generous but refreshingly frank. These minds search for answers about our universe -- answers that one day might benefit us all.Writing a review about the ideas of such impressive people is intimidating. The words on the pages of ""This Will Make You Smarter"" carry much more authority than the words on this screen, but if you've gleaned anything from reading this, it's that this is a genuinely important book. If your mind is a curious one, if you've ever wondered about the nature of our universe, our existence, or our collective and individual selves, than you should read it. It's just that good.Our world is one cleaved by conflict and paralyzed by politics. It is full of suffering -- suffering that isn't necessarily avoidable, but might be addressed better if we approached society's problems with scientific rigor instead of irrational dogmatism and ideological grandstanding. The stories told by our popular media frequently portray our species as violent, ignorant and ugly. ""This Will Make You Smarter"" shows us that we humans can also be beautifully, divinely wise. Because despite what the world's dominant religions might tell you, empirically speaking, we are all just collections of atoms that just happened to have gained self-consciousness.All of the thinkers featured in ""This Will Make You Smarter"" wrote their essays individually. Remarkably, Brockman has managed to arrange them in such a way that a narrative of sorts appears. This is very much a story -- the story of the human condition, told from the scientific perspective. By the time you've finished This Will Make You Smarter, you won't view it as an ostentatious red book. You'll view it as an old friend.And you will be smarter, whether you like it or not. "
70,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85649072-investingbythebooks-com,4,"This book belongs firmly in the surrounding knowledge category, which I suspect to most readers of InvestingByTheBooks is a category we turn to after all of the “real” book titles have been exhausted. Expanding one’s horizons is important I believe. In the words of Charlie Munger “In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time - none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads - at how much I read...”This Will Make You Smarter with its catchy title, is a pantheon of interesting insights and ideas that will satisfy even the most intellectually curious amongst us. The book does what it says on the tin. It is both a formidable compilation to have on the shelf and a good read. I like to pick it up from time to time to absorb some random insight from the world of biology, physics or neuroscience.The editor (there are 151 authors) is John Brockman. Brockman is a literary agent and an impresario and he created the website called Edge.org. If you take away just one thing from this review, let it be a visit to this website. Edge.org was launched in 1996 as a modern day version of the Bloomsbury Group, or ""The Reality Club,"" an informal gathering of intellectuals to share ideas and theories. In the words of the novelist Ian McEwan, Edge.org is ""open-minded, free ranging, intellectually playful ... an unadorned pleasure in curiosity...” Each year Edge publishes a book by posing a thought provoking question. The contents of these books contain the answers to the question from its erudite members. Through the years I have purchased and read most of these books. My favorite is the 2012 edition of the Edge question.In 2012 the question was “What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody’s Cognitive Toolkit?” or to paraphrase: if you, Mr(s) prominent scientist can offer your average person with one insight, one rule of thumb from the world of theoretical science that you think they ought to know, what would it be? The answers are far and varied but most are rooted in a branch of science. The essays range from a single paragraph in length to 4 pages and cover a total of 151 topics by as many authors. The members of Edge that have written for the book read as a who’s who in science across multiple disciplines. They include Steven Pinker, Daniel Kahneman, Richard Dawkins, Matt Ridley, Daniel Dennett as well as practitioners such as Paul Kedrosky and Vinod Khosla. There are too many entries to list, but I have some favorites. Kahneman writes about the Focusing Illusion i.e. “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it”. Ridley, the author of the Rational Optimist writes about Collective Intelligence highlighting the fact that human achievement is entirely a networking phenomenon driven by the forces of specialization and trade. James O’Donnek’s essay is entitled “Everything is in Motion” and quotes Heraclitus “You can’t step in the same river twice”.As a collection of essays the book lacks some structure. The entries appear in no particular order. There’s no ranking by status of the author for instance nor are there specific sections or chapters. Having read it a few times now, I noticed there is a grouping in that entries that cover a specific topic or theme such as randomness, “emergence” or the limits of human cognition, tend to go together. The lack of structure is also appealing; you can randomly flick through it and read an entry without having to read what came before to understand it.To the investor, intellectual curiosity and knowledge building are a necessity. This book if anything, highlights how little we know, and that the smartest people tend to be the ones often least convinced of their knowledge."
71,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8715301-nderson,4,"I chose to read this book attracted by the proposed methodology. The editor poses a question: ""What Scientific Concept Would Improve Everybody’s Cognitive Toolkit?"" And then all kind of scholars offer a response in the form of short articles. I was very enthusiastic when I began reading but then I realized the book was much longer than I thought (over 400 pages including notes and an index -useless in electronic edition by the way). Nevertheless I continued reading looking forward to seeing the answers that would be given to such an interesting question.The book has at least two essential characteristics. (1) It is an interdisciplinary book: This is reflected in the different essays of the book. Some are structurally complex whereas others are so short and spontaneous that they touch the border of poetry. This is good for the reader can always be expectant of what will come next. Yet it may also seem frustrating at times since it may disrupt the flow of the book and some articles are really low quality in comparison to others.(2) This is a scientific book: writers made their essays from the perspective of a scientist and even those short reflexive articles affirm so. This obviously mean that there is a plethora of new words to learn and it is advisable for the reader to have a dictionary at hand. Moreover, it is not seldom that authors make up their own words and turn the terms into the center of their reflection. As a studious person with a scientific inclination this characteristic compelled to me and I found most of the essays amusing. Nevertheless, my great objection to the book is the attitude of the writers. All throughout the book there is this feeling of using science as something to boast about. As a matter of fact many of the articles get annoying when some of the writers refer to anything out of their scientific world as less important and even something they can make fun of. Sarcasm is abundant and direct or indirect attacks to religious beliefs are found all throughout the book, with just a few exceptions. Though this proud attitude speaks more of the contributors as persons than of their disciplines, it made me consider to drop the book several times. It is paradoxical how people as smart as the writers in this book can fall victim of simplistic stereotypes labeling everyone outside of their intellectual sphere as less than them. This disdain is not only for religious people but also for people in the humanities and occasionally for those who belong to a different branch of science.Lastly, I feel that it would be more productive to read this book along one whole years (maybe a couple essays per day) rather than as your main reading. That would offer more time for reflection and process of the ideas presented and minimize the reader's ability to perceive the negative things I perceived by reading it at once.In conclusion, the title of the book makes an offer that should warn the reader of the embedded presupposition. The book offers to make you smarter because most of the writers consider that they are smarter than you and they are not slow to brag about it. In spite of this, many of the ideas are really thought-provoking and for a reader who is able to take what is good and ignore the rest this may be an enriching reading."
72,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5906224-jemma,3,"Lots of thought provoking and useful, concepts. Interestingly, some apparently contradict each other; sadly, a few seem born of right wing politics rather than science. Mostly good though."
73,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4105913-sara-habein,3,"Editor John Brockman posed the question ""What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?"" Leading scientists, psychologists, writers and general advanced ""thinkers"" responded with the short answers that make up This Will Make You Smarter, and the result is indeed thought-provoking, but not always interesting.However, the most interesting portion, to me, is that this was published before the self-plagiarizing/Bob Dylan quote fabrication scandal of Jonah Lehrer. Lehrer's contribution to this book, ""Control Your Spotlight,"" has to do with a study conducted with small children. The children were in a room with a bowl of marshmallows and told that if they could wait a short period of time alone, they could have more than one to eat. The study looked at impulse control, mainly, and the children who were better able to resist taking a marshmallow early were the ones who put their attention elsewhere. Some kids sang songs, others covered their eyes, etc. But what I find rather amusing is this bit from Lehrer:Willpower is really about properly diverting the spotlight of attention, learning how to control that short list of thoughts in working memory. It's about realizing that if we're thinking about the marshmallow, we're going to eat it, which is why we need to look away.So, am I to understand that he gambled on the working memory of Bob Dylan fans, and hoped that they were looking at other things when he made up those quotes? That's a pretty big gamble, that spotlight ""control."" He didn't have the smarts suggested in David G. Myers' contributing essay, ""Self-Serving Bias:""Being mindful of self-serving bias beckons us not to false modesty but to a humility that affirms our genuine talents and virtues and likewise those of others.In other words, work with what you've got, and work it well. Don't be a self-serving jerk who tries to make his book better with fake quotes. Also, never underestimate a music super-fan’s skills.(My full review appears at Glorified Love Letters.)"
74,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3074982-keith,3," This book is a collection of essays that are 2 or 3 pages long. The first few essays contend that we are not unique in the universe. A couple of them tell us that microbes dominate the earth and also the human body.  Several of them seemed to be way behind the times for example. (1) The Copernican Principle harks back to the 1800's when science believed that the universe was deterministic. This author seems unaware that quantum mechanics showed the deterministic viewpoint as being inadequate. (Page 11) (2) ""Experimentation"" seems to advocate changing only one variable at a time. That is a terribly inefficient method of studying complex phenomena. The author of this section ignores the power of Design of Experiments, which is a powerful method of narrowing down what matters and what doesn't when there are lots of possible causes. (Page 23) (3) The next essay glorifies experimentation: The Controlled Experiment advocates the value of controlled experimentation instead of ""instinct or partially informed debate."" (4) That is followed by an article advocating Thought experiments. (Since that is pretty much the opposite of the previous essay, perhaps there is something for everyone in this book of essays.) ""The (Thought Experiment) was particularly important during the development of quantum mechanics,"" His favorite is Galileo's (thought experiment) proof that ... Aristotle was wrong. (Page 28) The Pessimistic Meta-Induction from the History of Science article was more fun. ""Because so many scientific theories from bygone eras have turned out to be wrong, we must assume that most of today's theories will eventually prove incorrect as well."" (Page 30) ""knowledge collapses apparently as fast as it accretes, that our own most cherished beliefs might appear patently false to posterity. ... If, by contrast, you think that uncovering your mistakes is one of the best ways to revise and improve your understand of the world, then this is actually a highly optimistic insight."" (Page 31)"
75,0062109391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4644723-eva,5,"About 150 short articles, ranging between 1 to 4 pages (perfect for breakfast literature) from big names like V.S.

Carlo Rovelli writes ""The very foundation of science is to keep the door open to doubt. Precisely because we keep questioning everything, especially our own premises, we are always ready to improve our knowledge."" Several articles declare it is important to educate the public on probability values, to avoid ridiculous scares that are fuelled by misunderstandings of numbers (see vaccines, airport security scanners, ..). Top of the list are definitely also the issues concerning climate control, and how facts can be misinterpreted. In total there are lots of stabs on the general uneducated state of most Americans. And at societies stubborn preference for mediocrity instead of finding win-win situation through collaboration and compromise. I especially enjoyed:- David Eagleman's ""The Umwelt"" which talks about the limits of our senses and how each organism assumes its umwelt to be the entire objective reality out there. - Lee Smolin's ""Thinking in Time versus thinking outside of Time"" where he advocates for a perspective of truth where the ultimate truth doesn't lie outside our universe but within. In that way objects and ideas only exist once they are invented. Every feature of them is a result of their history and everything about them is negotiable and subject to improvement by the invention of novel ways of doing things. - Amanda Gefter's ""Dualities"" which talks about how we should sometimes replace our typically boolean thinking and embrace the scientific concept of dualities instead, that radically different theories can both be true and represent the same underlying reality.

Beware of anecdotes, they may be exceptional but they are not the rule. Don't generalise from them.4. If you must study exceptions, take note of its factors and circumstances.5. Science is a way of thinking.6. Be wary of the terms you use, it can mislead others.7. When you're not sure, don't say it.8. Science is anti-authoritarian so don't act like an authority figure when sharing knowledge.9. Teaching is a gift and service and not as a bastion of authority.10. Uncertainty is good. It is not dangerous. It gives us responsibility.11. Beware of base rates and don't solely base your decisions on them. (e.g. not taking a flight because of an unlikely chance of being killed by a terrorist)12. Let go of mind sets that aren't useful.13. Let go of theories that aren't useful.14.

The common thread seemed to be that we are led astray by modes of thinking and perceiving that come out of our genetic and cultural heritage and that may have been useful when our ancestors were first climbing down out of the trees, but which can lead us in the wrong direction when we are trying to solve modern scientific and social problems, so our instinctual modes of thought need to be replaced by a rigorous application of principles of scientific reasoning. It is a fair observation, but it is sometimes a little tedious to see it repeated endlessly in slightly different form in dozens of short essays. There are other ideas here too, but the book seems to continuously circle back to this central theme.One of the interesting things about this book was the editorial choice in the order of the essays. Adjacent essays tended to have similar themes and linking concepts. This helped to make the ideas more memorable, and made the book more fun to read.The best essays in the book are not necessarily by the most famous people, and none of the writers are anywhere close to the level of my favorite essayist, Montaigne, but there was some stuff to think about here, and I.

Gould described intelligence as a vernacular term that describes a wide variety of abilities propensities and interests none of which are very closely related to most of the others. If that is the case then it is hard or even impossible to measure smartness so that we can tell if someone has gotten smarter. What this book does do, though, is to teach you to think scientifically. That is, it teaches you to think scientifically if you are willing to learn to think scientifically. I have met all too many people who just reject not only learning to think rationally, but also reject learning what rationality even is. However, science is the study of reality and everything we want is gotten only by manipulating reality and the closer we can come to understanding what reality actually is the more efficiently can we manipulate it to our liking. That means that learning to think scientifically is a great benefit to all of us, both individually and collectively. If you learn to think scientifically and act accordingly then you will be acting in a way that can be said to be -- to use a vernacular term -- smarter. This book is well worth reading."

Some are as short as a paragraph. Some big names in here, but the comments are often too brief to be dazzling.Editing has been done cleverly, since the articles follow each other quite well, often leading into one another where there are common themes. As a side note, despite minor overlap, there are literally 150 different concepts in this book, which is rather amazing, even considering how vast the areas of expertise are (archaeology, psychology, physics, art, computer science, biology, chemistry, sociology, philosophy, etc.). One would think that some would stand out more than others?My favourite article was Richard Thaler's Aether. And I like anything about bias and fallacy. However, I'd say most of them are merely ok.

They included things like the Pareto Principle (aka the 80-20 rule), the idea of positive-sum games, that you can demonstrate danger but cannot demonstrate safety, that correlation is not causation, and black swan technologies. There are about 150 in all, and they give good food for thought. My recommendation is to read this a little bit at a time, perhaps an answer or two each day.

Some of these responses seem to ignore the question entirely, using this exercise as a vehicle for talking about their current pet research question or to write about a pet peeve loosely related to science and society. Some of the responses display a condescending tone and lack of understanding of non-academics and non-scientists that nicely illustrates the tradeoffs that specialization carries for society and its experts.

Mammoth effort by the author to put all these together in a single accessible form. The experts who have written these articles have really tried to simplify these concepts with admirable skill. The editing is superb. To my mind, This process of simplification is the most complex endeavour. For anyone interested in new ideas and scientific concepts this book is a treasure house. Must read. "

The title initially caught my eye, so I wrote it down; I'm always on the lookout for cognitive self-improvement methods. The synopsis made it clear that it was actually about what concepts leading folks in disparate fields thought were important for the general public to understand. I'm ok with that, in theory. In execution, the book is (in my opinion) a hodgepodge of oft-contradictory essays (extremely short ones, in fact). I got through a half-dozen or so musings on the Copernican and Anthropic principles before I cut my losses."

In text of maximum four pages, they introduce fascinating and interesting concepts, ideas, perspectives, thought processes and approaches. Some of them were familiar to me, but most were new, and the vast majority were interesting and useful (10% were unclear and fuzzy). It was very easy to read and quite enjoyable."

Plenty for the mind to chew on and frame current issues with, some of the chapters and the explanations were a little hard to follow. I think what would have made this book better is if the editor took all these Thinkers ideas and paraphrased them all in his own words, at least that way the work would have a consistency to it."

Short (1-3 pages) snippets from scientists and a few writers/poets/artists on what they see as the key concepts that one should know. These concepts generally provide a framework through which the writers interpret and explain the world around us. By explaining these concepts in 1-3 pages, they are pretty succinct. It was a good way to get exposure to a number of disciplines I don't usually follow. By putting them all in one place, it also allowed a chance to compare and evaluate different theories so I could formulate my own ideas of which are most important."
