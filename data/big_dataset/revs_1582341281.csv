0,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5,"Trust the YoungNumber theory has nothing to do with the real world, unless you happen to be a number theorist. Then it is the real world; everything else is illusory. Number theory has no application to anything except... well, numbers. It eschews other branches of mathematics as pedestrian. Physics, engineering, and even geometry, although they use numbers, are simply diversions for the less talented, that is to say inferior, intellect. Mere calculation is trivial even if it is arduous and complex. Number theory’s only concern is with the relationship of numbers to each other. It seeks the hidden, often mysterious, connections that exist, and have always existed, among these most abstract of all ideas. Since numbers are eternal, infinite, and everywhere, they are easily taken for divine (For more on the significance and literary import of number theory, see: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).And who knows? Numbers may well be divine. Among other reasons because the fundamental logic of numbers is as elusive as the theology of God. Apparently, just like any other believers, mathematicians make an act of faith every time they form an hypothesis, attempt a proof, or demonstrate a theorem. The reason that faith is necessary is that when the foundations of mathematics are probed far enough, they are shown to be, not built on sand, but entirely absent. All of mathematics, including number theory, floats above an intellectual void known as Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem. Kurt Godel showed in the 1930’s that no logical system, of which basic arithmetic is one, can contain the axioms necessary to ensure its own reliability. The consequences of Godel’s discovery are even more profound for mathematics than the discovery of Quantum Uncertainty is for physics.So Incompleteness raises some important issues which Doxiadis uses as the substrate of his story. If mathematics is suspect, what hope is there for any other science? Or for human thought in general? The Incompleteness Theorem seems to suggest that everything is relative, that intellectual discipline is a fraud, that science is some kind of con game which we pretend to take seriously. And yet, mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and the check-out assistants in the supermarket continue to work away with numbers as if nothing were amiss. Is their apparent faith different from that of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Mormons who also create doctrines, liturgies, and ethics over an abyss empty of ultimate reason and without sufficient reasons they can articulate?Uncle Petros introduces these issues implicitly in his concern with the so-called Goldbach Conjecture, an hypothesis first formulated by an 18th century mathematician: “Every number greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.” When he started his career, Uncle Petros was unaware of the Conjecture’s relation to the Incompleteness Theorem since the latter had yet to be formulated. But he had a certain faith, not just in his own mathematical ability but, more importantly, in the power of mathematics to ultimately prove or disprove what was Goldbach’s intuitive guess. One could accurately call this ‘blind’ faith but not as a reproach and not in the manner of religious faith, which when it is blind is often dangerous.The first difference between religious and mathematical faith, of course, is that mathematical hypotheses such as that of Goldbach are based on empirical observation; mathematics is very much an empirical discipline. Every specific number greater than two which has been analysed can be shown to be the sum of two primes. But such empirical proof is inadequate for mathematics no matter how often it is observed. There could be some number among the infinity of numbers for which this general rule doesn’t apply. Hence the importance of the Conjecture if it can be proven abstractly as an invariable condition for any number at all and not just specific numbers.This is where the mathematician’s second difference with religious believers comes into play. Mathematical logic works backwards from an hypothesis to discover the logic by which the hypothesis can be derived from communally accepted axioms. This logic can be both positive - if X, then Y etc. - or it can be negative - if not X, then Y or not Y etc. This latter form is that of a logical reductio ad absurdam, a contradiction which both affirms and denies a conclusion. Almost everything about religious faith is subject to a reductio ad absurdam. For example the proposition to reject the religious claim that ‘God created everything’ is compatible with both the axioms ‘the world is inherently good’ and ‘there is tremendous evil in the world.’ Creation is both good and not good with or without a divine origin. Mathematicians would view such a theological conclusion therefore as meaningless.*The final difference in matters of faith concerns the fundamental axioms and their status in mathematics and religion. The difference here is somewhat surprising. Theology relies on fixed axioms from which it the derives its conclusions. These axioms are given the status of revealed truth and are the dogmatic focus of religious faith. Mathematicians since Godel on the other hand know that the fundamental axioms of their science are somewhat arbitrary. Euclid’s axioms of three dimensional space, for example, can be replaced by the n-dimensional space of Riemannian geometry with no loss of logical rigor. Euclid is not proven wrong but merely shown to be a special case of the more general conditions of Riemann. This is an illustration as well of a crucial difference in method. Mathematics seeks to continuously extend the generality of its conclusions by discovering more and more inclusive axioms from which to work. Religious faith seeks to fix the axioms in order to preserve, limit and restrict doctrinal conclusions. Put another way: mathematics looks into the abyss of the Incompleteness Theorem and considers it an horizon to be striven toward painfully, incrementally, and with ho chance of complete success. This takes intellectual and, dare one say it, moral courage. The theologian looks into a similar abyss and considers that the horizon has arrived at his location. There is nothing to explore, nothing to find beyond the axioms which have been set by tradition. This sort of faith isn’t one of courage but stubbornness. It ramifies ‘conclusive’ conclusions because it takes its axioms for granted.So the faith of the mathematician is not the faith of the religious believer. The faith required to attack the apparent intractability if the Goldbach Conjecture has nothing to do with the faith that proclaims One God or a religious ethic of forgiveness, or retribution, or community. The mathematician must have perseverance; the theologian merely persistence. The mathematician is concerned about expanding the world we know, the theologian with limiting what we know of the world. One requires genuine creative faith; the other futile insistence. Doxiadis quotes the 19th century mathematician, David Hilbert: “We must know, we shall know! In mathematics there is no ignorabimus!"" Compare that with the commitment of religious faith by the first Christian theologian, Paul of Tarsus: “But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.”**Both mathematicians and theologians tend to be obsessives. Both types are probably born not made. But mathematicians reach their intellectual peak in their relative youth. The best theologians are usually old men. I suspect the reason for this has to do with the paradoxical character of experiential wisdom. Young mathematicians have an intuitive grasp of reality unsullied by too much knowledge of what others call the world; while old theologians have been pickled in cultural history and traditions of thought that distort much of reality. Uncle Petros himself tends to slide into quasi-theological reverie about mathematics in his dotage after suffering the slings and arrows of family as a failed mathematical prodigy, and especially after the publication of Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem. In a sense he has lost his faith in mathematics and replaced it with an entirely different kind of faithful resignation to cultural inevitability. This is why Petros loves chess: as in theology, its axioms are fixed, its rules invariably traditional.It takes his nephew to help Uncle Petros understand that Godel freed mathematics from theological pretensions. There is no firm foundation for mathematics. Even David Hilbert thought there was but he was wrong; and so was Uncle Petros if he thought that firm intellectual foundations were necessary for his continuing commitment to mathematics. As Doxiadis has Alan Turing say, “Truth is not not always provable.” But this doesn’t invalidate mathematics or its method. Unlike theology, the commitment to mathematics is to an entirely unknown, and unnamed, future state of knowing. The content of that state is not, and cannot be, specified much less proven. Doxiadis compares it to being in love. This is an important message from a young mathematician to an old one about a very different sort of tradition and a very different sort of faith, one that does away with “attainable goals.” And it is a message that makes Doxiadis’s little book a lot bigger than its size.———————————————————————————————————-*Neil Gaiman, in his American Gods captures the character of the reductio in theology rather well: “I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck.”** For those who have forgotten their school Latin ‘ignorabimus’ is future tense: “we will be ignorant.” St. Paul, significantly, is concerned solely about the present but only in terms of the past in his exhortation."

I was surely amazed to find the series:1+2+3+4+… = - 1/12 (Don’t miss this and the wiki article).But, I don’t perceive the number 65 as some city gentleman with bowler hat and rolled umbrella who doesn't like to stay away from his prime divisor 13 who is a goblin-like creature, supple and lightning-quick in his moves. Or, for that matter, the number 8191 also does not seem to me as a man wearing French gamin with a gauloise cigarette hanging from his lips. But number theorists, at least some of them, seem to feel them in this way, as the author, who is a mathematics PhD himself describes. This compelling novel portrays the story of a genius mathematician, Petros Papachristos, and his obsession with the yet-unproved Goldbach’s conjecture. He loves to live in complete isolation, and his family members – his businessmen brothers and their families – are happy to be apart from him. Actually, his brothers loath him and it is not that Petros wants to maintain a smooth relationship, either. He epitomises the stereotype of absent-minded mathematician. As the story progresses, this novel provides many pithy observations of a mathematician’s life. For example, though an embarrassing one,:Anybody who claims that scientists – even the purest of the pure, the most abstract, high-flying mathematicians - are motivated exclusively by the Pursuit of Truth for the Good of Mankind, either has no idea what he’s talking about or is blatantly lying. Although the more spiritually inclined members of the scientific community may indeed be indifferent to material gains, there isn’t a single one among them who isn’t mainly driven by ambition and a strong competitive urge. I think it as natural, as a mathematician is also a human. All in all reading this novel, praised by eminent mathematicians like Ken Ribet and Michael Atiyah, was really a pleasant experience. Highly recommended!Now, I should go back to do some of my calculations, if you excuse. P.S. : I can only think of Andrew Wiles', who proved Fermat's last theorem, devotion to mathematics nearing the picture of an ""ideal"" mathematician. Please, I implore you, see this absolutely stunning documentary : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Bqx6..."
2,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"This is more of a short story than a novel. On the surface it is about the fictional mathematical prodigy Petros Papachristos. His life goal has been to prove one of the oldest unsolved problems of number theory, Goldbach's Conjecture. This states that every even integer greater than two is the sum of two primes. Petros’ nephew tells the story. First of all, mathematical axioms, theories and proofs 
do
 take up a significant portion of the text. For me, much of the mathematical reasoning went in one ear and immediately out the other. Nevertheless, you need not master the theoretical mathematical reasoning to grasp the intent of the tale. Real life, historically famed mathematicians, such as G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing, play pivotal roles in the plot. In my view there is more to the story than just mathematics. The central focus is instead how individuals set their life goals. Should goals be obtainable? How does one cope with lack of success when goals are not attained? To what extent do we need goals to go on living? Is it pure craziness to stretch toward a dream that may be unobtainable? I personally do not think so.Part of the tale is told rather than actively lived and experienced alongside the characters. This is when the nephew as a middle-aged man looks back on his own life and relates what he has learned about his paternal uncle. The story picks up again when the nephew confronts his uncle, demanding that they discuss their shared past and the reasons behind his uncle’s actions. It is here one gets to the message the tale is meant to convey. Keith Szarabajka narrates the audiobook very, very well. The characters’ feelings are well portrayed. Different accents are employed. The narration is clear and easy to follow.I have given both the audiobook narration and the written text four stars, despite the rather tiring mathematical details of the story. I like very much what the story says."
3,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1,5,"Apparently maths can be fun. Not something I ever really appreciated as a child. Mostly maths was a lesson in which eye contact was to be avoided, a) to limit the chances of being called upon to make any kind of answer regarding anything even vaguely numeric and b) because the maths teacher was kind of creepily weird. This book is what I'd regard as one of the more unconventional additions to the 1001 books list and I really enjoyed learning about the maths as well as Uncle Petros' life story. Big bonus points for combining super-scary mathematical theorum with nice jaunty readable prose. However, possibly more impressive than the story itself is the authors own scholarly achievements which are listed in glorious technicolour in the his mini biog at the back of the book. Child maths prodigy, university alumnus at 15, writer, film producer, scientist, playwrite and all round full on genius. Basically he's the type of guy who'd have had the school boy Professor Brian Cox running to hide behind the back of the bike sheds to weep big ovo-spherical lacrimosal excretions over the fact that he's just not that smart. In fact if the Greek Government sought out Apostolos Doxiadis, he'd probably be able to generate an economy saving algorithm on the back of a packet of Karelia while simulataneously writing a screen play about it."
4,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27040673-n-j-ramsden,3,"A very pleasing little novel. Clever, witty, and enjoyable. Unfortunately it's also pretty forgettable, and I fail to recall more than a hazy glow of general satisfaction from my reading of this.Of course, not the least of its pleasures lies in watching a bookshop assistant struggle with their keyboard as you ask ""Do you have Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis?""Yeah."
5,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232443-francis,5,"A beautiful, compelling, and tragic story of mathematical obsession. As the story starts, Uncle Petros, once a promising young mathematician, has wasted his intellectual gifts, amounted to very little professionally, and his family holds him in contempt but takes care of him. As his nephew tries to discover what happened from him, Uncle Petros reveals his story of how his brilliant start was eclipsed by his all-consuming obsession to crack Goldbach's conjecture. Along the way he crosses paths with many of the famous mathematical personalities of the early 20th centiry.I thought the novel was remarkably accurate in conveying the passion, frustrations, and angst of pursuing mathematical research. Basically, only the first one to get a correct proof published gets the glory, even if someone else was really close, or even cracked it first but didn't manage to tell anyone. The paranoia of having your work ""scooped"" is omnipresent. The other omnipresent fear is that of wasting the best years of your life, or perhaps one should say the most potent CPU cycles of your brain, on a dead end; a commonly held aphorism is that a mathematician's best work is done before the age of thirty. This fear of losing one's edge can be so overwhelming that some mathematicians have committed suicide when they felt that their powers had peaked (the tragic case of Taniyama, whose conjecture with Shimura was one of the key ideas in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, being the first to come to mind).While I thought Uncle Petros' fall from grace was a rather exaggerated reaction, given that the entire mathematical community had to deal with the exact same problem, it is entirely believable that someone of his brilliance and passion could have experienced the kind of visceral, distraught flameout that he displayed at the thought that his work might be inevitably doomed to failure.I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a passionate depiction of the emotions of mathematical inquiry."
6,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96597965-shankar,5,"The title of the book enticed me. I am a sucker for themes that involve math stories. In some way I feel i am redeeming myself for not studying math well enough in my school days.This is a very interesting story of a ""could have been great"" mathematician Petros Papachristos. He took on an very tough old math problem of the Goldbach Conjecture and attempted to solve it to achieve fame - and thereby win back his first and only girlfriend Isolde.The story is set in the time of G H HArdy and Ramanujam who were Number Theorists and also were in pursuit of similar tough problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis and Fermat Theorem.I felt the story was well narrated and kept the pace right through - maybe because of my own interest. I think the narrative is good even for those who are not interested in the math portion of the story as it does not get technical at all. Highly recommended."

8,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038091-matthew,4,"Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture tells the story of a brilliant mathematician obsessed with proving Goldbach's Conjecture (as reformulated by Euler: every even number greater than two is the sum of two primes). Despite the seemingly difficult mathematical subject, the book is a quick and easy read. This is a testament to the clear and simple prose of the author, himself a mathematician by training. While math is the main focus of the book, an underlying theme is the question of how and why we should select attainable goals. As the nephew puts it in a romantic outburst: ""While his brothers were studying and getting married, raising children and running the family business, wearing out their lives along with the rest of nameless humanity in the daily routines of subsistence, procreation and killing time, he, Prometheus-like, had striven to cast light into the darkest and most inaccessible corner of knowledge."""
9,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,4,"Uncle Petros is considered the black sheep of the family, one of “life’s failures”, by his two younger brothers. His nephew, the first person narrator of the story, sees his uncle only once a year when the family gathers for a ritual visit. The nephew is intrigued by the man and especially by his library of books containing some mysterious symbols like ∀ and ∃ and ∫. One day he finds out that uncle Petros was a mathematician when he was young. The boy starts to get an interest in mathematics himself but before he really starts, he promises to prove to his uncle his natural talent for dealing with numbers. “Mathematicus nascitur, non fit,” is what Petros says. “A Mathematician is born, not made.” The task Petros poses to his nephew isn’t easy, and by the end of the summer their relationship has become quite different than it was before…This may sound like a novel for (math-) nerds, but it isn’t at all. Although the titular Goldbach’s conjecture is indeed a well-known math problem you don’t need any math to enjoy the book. If you know what a prime number is, and if you can add integers, you’re pretty much set. In fact it’s even better to not lookup the conjecture on Wikipedia, because knowing what it says would somewhat spoil the beginning of the novel. And if you always wanted to know how mathematicians tick you should give this book a try. The author succeeds in bringing us a little closer to this strange kind of species, with all of its quirks, successes, and failures. Oliver Sacks calls this novel “very funny” and “charming” in his praise on the cover of the Kindle edition that I read. I don’t know where Mr Sacks got this from. For me there were only very few comic events here, and the charm is quite limited. The first adjective that comes to my mind is “tragic” actually.One personal highlight was the mentioning of Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing and the connection of their respective results with Goldbach’s conjecture. Both of these two great scientists, who also suffered a tragic fate, appear briefly as characters in the book. There are a couple more mathematical problems mentioned, two of which had been proved since the book was first published and the publishers announced a $1 million prize for anybody who proved Goldbach’s conjecture within two years (until 2002). Needless to say the prize was never awarded.Don’t be put off by the little math there is! We have here a really good and inspiring book about the tragic life of a scientist. Only the prose occasionally feels a little stilted to me.

I absolutely loved how Doxiadis transformed this well-known thread of history of mathematics into an unputdownable novel. It is amazing how simple his characters look and yet how intricately complex their inner struggles are. The bits about Hardy, Littlewood, Godel and Turing are well blended and adds to the overall value of the reader's experience."
11,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Repetitive and dull. The meddle of an author is easily tested by how often he or she uses the same phrase to describe something. While Goldbach's Conjecture is central to the plot of the novella the author says the conjecture dozens of time when this reference is un-needed. The author in no way indicates the actual progress of the problem and the introduction of Kurt Godel and Alan Turing was a dis-service to their memory when presented with such dull dialog.The end was both a twist and totally expected, a phenomenon that happens two other times in the book."
12,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short book--a fast and easy read. The story describes how a good mathematician sank into an obsession that swallowed up his life. The storyteller's mathematician friend, Sammy, mentions that the trail of a mathematical quest will be littered with intermediate, published results on a variety of topics. So, why didn't Uncle Petros publish his intermediate--but important--results? Interestingly, I do not remember another novel with as many footnotes as this one! (Actually, I don't remember any novels with an author's footnotes.)"
13,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6984857-petros,4,"A definitely unusual read, this book deals with the obsession of mathematics. Most people would find them to be boring and useless, nothing but theories without a practical use in everyday life (outside adding or multiplying). The book focuses on the life of a mathematician and shows why this type of people love it so much. Turns out (if you don’t know it yet) that mathematicians love solving enigmas concerning numbers. And not in the same sense as others solve puzzles or sudoku; they love proving or rejecting theories by using formulas. Thus we practically see the life of such a person as he tries to find a solution to everything via numbers and hard facts. As emotionless or boring as that sounds, it is in fact a very humane story that focuses both on its characters, as it does on the so-called infallible numbers that control the universe. It is a biography first, and a mental search for the truth second. We see their daily lives, their mistakes, their passion and disappointment, as both uncle and nephew try to write down a mathematical formula that proves right or wrong a centuries-old theorem. It is not by any means a hard to grasp tale; it is easily accessible for most readers. All its complicating mathematics are presented in quite the easy to grasp way and it is mostly what the characters do throughout the years, or the methods they use in order to find the truth, and less on endless pages of dribbles regarding weird symbols. The author is a mathematician himself (amongst other things) so the story was written from the perspective of one and feels very believable and honest. At no point does he try to deify math and present propaganda for people to pick up his favorite subject. He does describe the beauty of looking for numbers to solve something but he also never forgets to pinpoint how devastating it may be if you offer your life to just that, and how you may spend it in vain or get mad along the way because of your obsession. Thus it is evenly presented, never taking sides or trying to enforce a one-sided idea to the reader. Unlike many other famous authors who use an easy writing to tell stories with very interesting concepts, Doxiadis is never trying to offer a convenient or far-fetched finale just for the sake of leaving the reader with a happy ending. Harry Potter’s Rowling, or The Alchemist’s Coelho may be far more famous and rich than Doxiadis but their story are too silly and superficial if you try to see them with a more critical eye. This book does not fall into that mistake and it is both a good read AND teaches the reader of important life lessons without ever resorting to cop-out magical or improbable finales. Recommended. As a side note, the same author also made Logicomix, a graphic novel with an almost identical premise. Check that too in case you adored Uncle Petros. "
14,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3737508-nicolle,5,"I didn't have any preconceptions for this book, my only previous knowledge was that it is about mathematics (obviously!) which, to be fair, means I'm already in favour before I turn the front page! Apostolos Doxiadis has quite cleverly comprised the story of his Uncle Petro's mathematical life into this charming novel without going into too much detail about the mathematics itself making it unambiguous for the non-mathematician to read (or a beginner like me). I particularly liked the way the bulk of the history of Uncle Petros was told in his own words as he told his nephew his life story and that the only reason he set himself the mammoth task of proving Goldbach's Conjecture was to 'woo' a woman. To me this novel is about so much more than the tale of Petros, it depicts the thrill and the dedication mathematicians have when at work. A mathematician is overwhelmed with gratification when a hypothesis is proved by them or even when one is presented and through a logical process they come to understand and have that 'Eureka!' moment of enlightenment. An understanding is also made with the great mathematicians whom literally sacrifice their lives socially and health-wise for the miraculous results they procure. I think noone could read this novel without sympathising with them. "

Overwhelmingly they were seduced by the apparent centrality of narrative, that is Uncle Petros, the mathematical prodigy, and his fixation on solving the Goldbach Conjecture. But that was not the key issue of the novel. That key issue was stated two-thirds into the story - That humankind can aspire to solve everything by reason, but practically speaking, it is the lesson of Icarus that is the bottom line. ""Set yourself achievable goals"" may seem to be the pragmatic advice of the narrator's father, but it is also highly practicable. Uncle Petros' ultimate failure had nothing to do with mathematics, but his ignoring that ancient Greek proverb, γνῶθι σεαυτόν, Know Thyself. I am a dunce when it comes to mathematics, but I found this a gripping good read.UPDATEAn acquaintance (not on Goodreads) who has a strong background mathematics for completely missing the point of the book! I am posting his comment to me. All I can do is dumb-slap myself upside the head and cry out a Homer Simpsonian, ""D'oh!""""[The book] has everything to do with math. Godel himself states that that which is in the set cannot have complete knowledge of the set, so one who is within oneself cannot know oneself. The ancient Greek no longer holds."""

What's really disappointing - to me - is that it doesn't actually get into the math very much; for the most part it just kind of describes without explaining (""Then I tried a an algebraic approach""). Also, I found parts of it extremely obnoxious (like the end!) - especially the veiled notion that only the romantic genius type can be a ""true"" mathematician, and the corresponding implication that mathematics is the only real abstract intellectual pursuit.

It's mathematical without being overly specific and tedious, which makes it a great read for many people and not just those who appreciate math. This story was very cleverly written. You never know the name of the narrator, which seems kind of strange but works really well. It also blends in mathematical history very well, including many well known mathematicians. This is a very fast read and very enjoyable."

Another fine book that attempts to approximate what is going on in the mind of the mathematician (a state I will never know but like to imagine). Also brought to mind Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season,"" - a story I love about a mathematician consumed by an insurmountable problem."
19,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,4,"Delightful & short. And rather realistic, afaik, about mathematics researchers.

Some intriguing reveiws on the back and next thing i knew i was 30 pages into the story stood stock still while other browsers had to move around me (serious breach of book browsing etiquette.)Taking a deep breath I handed over £3.50 to a rather indifferent bookseller and finished the book two days later having opened it up at every opportunity and put everything else on the reading pile on hold.... So what it is Uncle Petros and Goldbach's conjecture about? Well the title is in fact the whole plot summary..... if you are into reducing books to their simplest denominators the title says it all... But of course all the title does in fact is to whet the appetite... so a littel more...Well yes it is about maths...Goldbach's conjecture to be precise...an obscure problem I had certainly never heard of before...And its about the ""author's"" Uncle Petros who seems to be universally despised by his brothers and other family members and is certainly not active on the social or family scene. In fact he seems to be a recluse... so a mystery then... What on earth has this inoffensive man done to make himself so despised? muses the nephew. So the story tells of his attempts to discover the truth about his uncle...Essentially the novel explores about the lure of complex problems for the mental gymnast through one man's obsession to discover an elusive proof. On the way we are introduced to some other great mathematicialns including Turing. But somehow the maths is almost irrelevent...that is ...you do not need to be a mathematician to appreciate the story... It is a story about the power of an idea I guess. A funny sad beautiful powerful story that hangs in the mind and has its own mysterious beauty and appeal. I am so glad I found this book...or it found me...and i dont even quite know why.... Gilbert Adair of the Independent wrote...""Surely pure maths and gripping fiction stand at opposite ends of the cultural universe? Not in this fine novel...."" 'nough said. "
22,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/872942-kelly,4,"I'm an English teacher and librarian, and although I took math classes all through high school and did well enough in college, I have never considered myself a math person. It's not that I don't understand concepts; it's more that math has never touched my soul the way that reading has. I remember very little of all the equations I learned in school, and I feel awful that I cannot help students with their math problems at school. I am always telling myself I need to take a refresher course or two. I think in metaphors, but unlike Uncle Petros, I've never envisioned numbers as people (oh, the twins in this story!)I read this book solely because it was a book club choice for school this year, sponsored by the math department. I am grateful that this book, along with the other two math books I read this summer, has instilled in me a great appreciation for the beauty and elegance and purity of math. There were so many famous people and their works mentioned in this book, that I found myself keeping a list and then researching them on the internet. When a book prompts me to do this, you know I've invested in the story. This book helped me to understand how math lovers feel the same awe, dismay, anger, love, and passion for math rockstar, problem, theorem, equation, etc. that I experience when I read a great book. I can begin to comprehend how my oldest daughter, a math teacher, feels about her subject. I never knew that while trying to solve unsolvable problems, some mathematicians make famous discoveries that are equivalent to little babies of that problem. And the publish or perish world and the competition among peers - such a tragedy in this story! This story is sweet and sad, and I was charmed by the relationship between uncle and nephew. This is a coming of age story, a tribute to a beloved relative, and yes, a story of the madness that stems from obsession. It's a story for everyone, not just lovers of math. For those of us who are not math aficionados or who claim we are not good at math or just don't get it, this book will open our eyes to the wonder of numbers. "
23,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,5,"When I was at school I hated Maths (yes over here we say it in the plural) with a passion. When I’m confronted with a ton of numbers my mind just refuses to work. The funny thing is when I’m reading these mathematical/scientific novels all the concepts become clear. This was the case of Uncle Petros…On the whole it’s a very simple story. The narrator is a good mathematician but finds out that his mysterious Uncle Petros is a professor in the subject. On further investigation he has found out that Uncle Petros has not published a single paper or theory since the mid 30’s and so he is curious to why his uncle has been inactive.Through a long confession the narrator discovers that Uncle Petros had fallen in love with a girl, and in order to impress her, decided to solve Goldbach’s Conjecture ( An even number greater than two is always the sum of two primes). One of the most difficult problems to prove.Needless to say that this becomes Petros’ obsession for 20 years and he turns into a madman. When he realises that the conjecture cannot be rejected he accepts his fate (and the mighty repercussions) and settles down playing chess.The narrator doesn’t believe that all theories should be accepted and eggs Uncle Petros to revive the theory, which he does and returns to his madman status. Eventually Uncle Petros makes a breakthrough but at a cost.Doxiadis does an excellent job in creating a highly readable and fun book. All theories are explained clearly so that anyone can understand them and although it promotes the ‘mathematician as insane genius’ stereotype it done with a lot of exuberance and charm. If there is a film that complements this book then I suggest Darren Aronofsky’s 1999 film ‘Pi’ which shares a lot of the same themes here."

The writing was mediocre - but it's hard to know how much was lost in the translation from the original Greek - and the story somewhat predictable. But I liked it cause it kicked off a firestorm of mathematical obsession in me, and that's a good thing. Teaching rather ho-hum Algebra 1 all day long puts me into a bit of a math rut at times, and it was fun to find something to reawaken my sensibility of mathematics as elegant, mysterious and thrilling. I really like Number Theory, though it makes me realize (like the protagonist) that though I can teach it on the high school level and enjoy it from the sidelines, I am not a gifted mathematician. Also cool was the way real mathematical figures (Hardy, Littlejohn and Ramunajun) were interwoven as characters in the novel - Uncle Petros' colleagues.By the way, Goldbach's Conjecture (stated by Christian Goldbach and clarified by the great Euler) is that every even number can be written as the sum of 2 primes. It has yet to be proven or disproven."

It's an interesting fact/theory, but it seems a slight one to base a novel on, much less spend your whole life trying to prove that it is true in every occasion. Petros Papachristos does waste his life trying exactly that, although whether it is a waste depends on your point of view. His nephew sees it as a noble struggle in a quest for the essence of things, and endeavours to follow a mathematical number theory path. The novel struggles on several fronts: a clunky translation may not do Doxiadis justice, the fact that Goldbach's Conjecture very publicly remains unproven does not help the dramatic potential, and however much the author tries to circumnavigate the fact, very clever men sitting around and musing over obscure mathematical theories is not very gripping.As a study of obsession, selfish pride and self-justification though, it works very well indeed. Now where is my pencil? I have an intuition about the number 4786 and its constituent primes....."

Besides narrating a captivating and insightful story, Doxiadis, a surprisingly good teacher who teaches by restatement, surveys mathematics and its history, bringing in historical passionate mathematicians as characters and overall enlightening and entertaining the reader.

I have always liked maths, though I prefer algebra to geometry and calculus and other more complicated things. I also like books about scientists because I know scientists and I understand how their minds work (most of the time). Also, I really enjoy mystery stories and that's what science is all about, after all, solving mysteries. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, but considering the facts the novel is based on (being actual maths), I suppose it was inevitable. I highly recommend this to people who enjoy scientific sorts of mystery stories."

At least it was pretty short.There was some good to it. It was a drama about a mathematician and his quest to prove Goldbach's Conjecture.

Although its Turkish translation exists, I am not surprised that I hadn't heard about it before. I don't know how these translations bring money to their publishers in Turkey. Unless they are bestsellers, they sell very little. I read that it sold 12 million copies after Doxiadis translated and published U. Petros in English. This is a huge number. Roughly 1 in 100 (considering the adult population only, it gets higher) must have read UP in the Western World. I like the fact that when it was first released in Greek it did not receive much attention and only after it was translated to English and became a bestseller initiating a new genre ""math literature"" the Greek readers also acknowledged its charms. I always wanted to have such an experience myself. Doxiadis seems to be a successful person in whatever he has done. The story line of the book does not have many interesting twists. Its beauty stems from the way it presents popular math stories and unusual mathematicians. "

Much of the story telling is built around a failed attempt to solve a mathematical notion. Not just Mathematics, but Number Theory. This alone will scare off readers. Doxiadis has used what to some is a boring and highly esoteric topic to build a very human mystery. This is also a story about family loyalty, goal setting, failure and just how high level thinking and life can come together. I liked Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture. I encourage you to step into this very real fiction about people. You may have to push your comfort zone. No violence, no sex, no particular politics, mild language and people who like and care for each other.According to Wiki: “Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.” The fact that it is called a conjecture means that it is not much more than a guess. Is there a practical application for this conjecture? I do not know and no one in this book cares. What matters is that it represents to the right mathematical thinker a challenge. Solving or attempting to solve these kinds of problems have a history of producing secondary methodologies with some kinds of independent value, but this is settling for the invention of the ball bearing when your goal was to invent the automobile.So much for the central narrative driver of the book. Nephew Papachritos becomes fascinated by his remote and disparaged, failed Uncle the one time mathematical prodigy, Petros. Risking his father’ wrath and later hisown future the Nephew immerses himself in an effort to comprehend the world of Math at its highest and most remote thinking. His purpose is less to achieve any great breakthroughs as to fully understand the motives and meaning of his uncle’s life.Among the way we are introduced to great minds like G. H. Hardy, Kurt Godel, Bertrand Russell and Alan Turing. First their minds and later their fates as humans. For many the life at the forward edge of mathematical thinking ends young and their life as humans, punishing.This is good story telling. You are invited to stretch your mind. Doxiadis asks you to enter the world of those who can think these kinds of thoughts, without forcing you to try and think at this level. Instead the real story is about the humans. What are their motives and what costs are they risking to follow where their brains take them?"
42,1582341281,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232279-katya,4,"A curious little book. The main character is uncle Petros - an obsessed and ambitious mathematician. My friend compared him to Grigoriy Perelman (who has proved Thurston's geometrization conjecture and refused to take the prize for it), saying that uncle Petros is an Anti-Perelman. And my friend is very right - the book is about Math, but it is also about a huge ambition. His entire life uncle Petros has been trying to prove Goldbach's conjecture. He had been working day and night refusing himself everything, in secret, lest his friends and colleagues would beat him to it. He made several important discoveries on the way, but they were not big enough for him, since he was aiming at the main prize - the conjecture itself. Of course, he did not prove the conjecture, but that is not the point of the book.I find this selfless, yet quite selfish character of Petros really fascinating. Especially taking into consideration how the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorems affects this mathematical giant. Тhe point of Gödel's theorem basically says there are true statements that are unprovable within the system. This statement introduced an unstable element into uncle Petros' seemingly stable universe, and that was enough to change his very personality. I guess, this is the difference between people who do something for the sake of the process itself (like Perelman) and those, who work for a certain practical result like uncle Petros. People like Perelman are impossible to buy or to defeat, they are unsinkable. I also think that the likes of Perelman enjoy Life much more than the likes of Petros. "

The obsession belonged to the uncle of the protagonist, petros. But rather than being an irrational compulsion of a short circuiting mind, his obsession was purely rational from beginning to end. Further, it was supported, and eventually undermined, by the mathematical theories of its time (that being the early 20th century).As a book, uncle petros is educational and engaging, a tale of mathematical mystery, of personal motivations, and the morality we apply to one another's life decisions. Petros turns to chess later in life to rest his mind and ease himself away from the rigors of number theory, but he cannot escape from his own demons, especially the twins representing, in his dreams, the number 2^200. The twins, beautiful and compassionate, pursue him and guide him. They help to maintain petros through his darkest hours - those when he needs the most strength, as when he closes in on a proof of goldbach's conjecture, and when his physical strength is flagging. But they also condemn him for being untrue to himself and giving up when an excuse presents itself. I bought this book thinking it was something different. It sat on my shelf for more than a year until I pulled it down for something to pass time waiting for my son to get ready to leave the house. The next thing I knew, I was possessed. "

I did recognize a few of the other mathematicians mentioned in this short novel. I'm not sure how they came to my attention, other than the British G.H. Hardy who I encountered reading The Indian Clerk. The brilliant mathematician in this, Petros Papachristos, is fictional.One does not need to be very familiar with the science of mathematics to appreciate this book. Still, one must be somewhat tolerant of its inclusion in the text. It would be near impossible to tell a story of a mathematician's obsessive pursuit of 250-year old unsolved conjecture without the reader being exposed to at least some theories of mathematics.The translation was good and the prose quite readable. The characterizations were complete enough, though this isn't long enough probably for them to be fully fleshed. There are no women in the story, although Uncle Petros does tell of a youthful love interest. This is just a good, solid 3-stars, perhaps rising toward the upper parts of that groups."

While he was doing it, he did not know if he was going to succeed, he spent days and weeks and years obsessed with the beauty and intricacy of numbers up to the last minute (no spoiler alert). This poses a question: does it matter if he solved it or not? To me, the reading shows the absurdity of embarking on a great grand enterprise expecting to succeed. Is not that the joy is in the journey or what not common places, but that meaningful things in life, particularly major scientific discoveries, are, in essence, unpredictable. Papachristos' nephew tells the charming story of his Uncle Petros in a moving, captivating and brilliant way. He tells his own story too, how he fell in and out of love with mathematics and how he turned back when the boundary of madness and mathematical knowledge appeared in front of him.

Goldbach's conjecture (about 260 years old) states that ""all even numbers greater than 2 are the sum of two prime numbers."" Prime numbers turn out to be very interesting - they are divisible only by themselves and the number 1. To date prime numbers can't be predicted, and the race has been on in modern times to do that and to keep find ever larger prime numbers. Mathematicians are like athletes - they do their best work when they are young - and in the process of trying to solve huge math problems like Goldbach's Conjecture they often discover lesser but still important math truths. This book is a very quick read and well worth the time."

If the 1001-list tries to cover all human emotions this little corner of scientific obsession needed a book on the list and Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture suits that place well.

Reading this felt a bit like reading Vikram Sethe's An Equal Music to me: I don't understand the thing the these characters are obsessed about (mathematics or classical music), so some nuances are most likely lost on me.

Plus, the art of setting goals in life - should you play safe and set attainable goals, or go for the jugular and be ready to take failures in your stride?The author maintains a steady flow making it a breezy read, but slightly overcooks the climax for a dramatic effect.

The book talks about death, insanity and tragedy in mathematics - a result of ""getting too close to the Truth"" - but doesn't make the case as strong as it could have."

No doubt it has done well among the maths students types."

This may be the first time I really understood the thrill of high-level mathematics - Although this level of math is beyond me (so far!), this novel helped me understand the obsession with the puzzles. This book is heartbreaking, not only in terms of its portrayal of disfunctional familial relationships but also because it makes so starkly clear the limited span of the one human life we're each given. This is a concise read in which every word is honed to precision - Highly, highly recommended."

It's beautifully written, and the author is a very nice guy, to boot. I've read it several times, lent it out, lost it, found it again and read it aloud to my husband on a road trip. Well-written, easy to read and absorbing. Apostolos Doxiadis has given life and form and shape to something that's otherwise horrible, incomprehensible problems in a horrible, heavy textbook. Mathematics, like everything else, has a story, and this book finds it alive and well."
