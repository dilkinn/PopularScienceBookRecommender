0,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346768-ramsey,5,"Book operates around 5 major concepts:1. The Adjacent Possible- contrary to popular belief innovation seldom changes the game completely by creating something incredibly advanced. More often, innovation unlocks a realm of the adjacent possible (That which can be achieved given the components that are already in existence). Ex: in the primordial soup of Earth pre-life, amino acids could be formed spontaneously through random collisions of atoms and functional groups. It would've been impossible for a functional cell to be formed then because the number of fortuitous collisions would've been staggering. Cells could be formed once their simpler components were present in the environment. Innovation takes simple components and makes slightly more complex products in a continuous cycle.2. Liquid Networks- Because the adjacent possible is unlocked through random collissions in components, it makes sense that innovation would thrive in so-called ""liquid environments"" in which component ideas are able to flow freely. Cities are such liquid environments. The internet is the ultimate liquid environment. Offices are trying to become more liquid environments thorugh encouraging collaboration. 3. Slow Hunch- The narrative of the ""Eureka moment"" is seldom accurate. More often than not innovation occurs once a slow hunch has reached maturity. Slow hunches can reach maturity by colliding with other ideas. hus, keeping one's slow hunches alive is advisable to promote innovation. Keeping a commonplace book is an excellent way to cultivate and keep alive a slow hunch. Innovation is also promoted by cross-polination between different fields. Many famous scientists and thinkers have switched what they are spending their time on every couple of days. This puts the original thought in one's sub conscious. 4. Serendipity is obviously important to innovation because with increased serendipity comes increased collisions between slow hunches. Information overflow encourages creativity. The internet promotes the ultimate information overflow. 5. Error- ""Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to explore."" Sometimes the noise is the signal, humans have a natural tendency to dismiss error. Our body maintains some error in DNA replication to continue the evolutionary drive (whether this is by evolutionary design or by the inability for a perfect system is unknown).6. Exaptation- Taking an idea or thing from one field and applying it to another field. Gutenberg with the screw press. In dense urban centers exaptations are more likely. Weak-tie expatation. Utilizing the weak-tie of Connectors to exapt ideas. Apple development cycle is more like a coffehouse than an assembly line; Everyone plans it all together instead of designers followed by other people. In the latter method there is a tendrency for the thing to be whittled down. 7. Platforms - Ecosystem engineers. Generative platforms come in stacks. Platforms encourage and amplify hunches. Twitter's open-source software allows different people to run twitter machines which increases popularity. Hashtags and @ also came from early twitter users because of the platform. API=open platform in software8. The Fourth Quadrant (non-market, networked) has provided a proportionally high amount of innovation.The problem with Quadrant One(market, networked) is that it encourages us to build artificial walls (patents etc.) around information. When information flows free everyone benefits."

Another 'popular / best selling' author with a 'great' book full of 'new' insights.Johnson describes where good ideas come from (hence the title) by breaking it down into 7 patterns: the adjacent possible, liquid networks, the slow hunch, serendipity, error, exaptation, platforms. Each chapter describes a pattern by starting out with an anecdote of some inventor x in city y in year z. Then the pattern is defined / described and finally a bit elaborated upon with possibly more anecdotes. It's nice to read an anecdote now and then but after three chapters it gets really annoying. And whereas the idea of breaking down 'idea generation' into seven patterns is a nice, and the patterns in itself are interesting enough subjects, the way Johnson treats the patterns and elaborates on the patterns is really disappointing. There is no real deep original insight or new thought from the side of the author. And where the first three chapter could keep my attention and approval, from the fourth chapter (serendipity) Johnson really misses the point, in my opinion. He describes serendipity well enough but in his apologia of the critique that the Internet prevents serendipity, he is blabbering sheer nonsense. He states that since we can use Google and wikipedia, we can much easier deepen and extent our serendipitous encounters and hunches. But that is a posteriori, the serendipitous event has already taken place when I start searching Google for 'The process church of holy judgement' after seeing, the never heard of before Sabbath Assembly, opening up for Earth, realising they base their music on the same cult from the sixties where Cleveland's Integrity built their 'Church of holy terror' thinking on. In the final chapters there is some inexplicable flirting with Darwinian evolutionary ideas which are interesting in themselves but I didn't really see the analogy or their role as argument in the point he is trying to make.The final, conclusive chapter is actually quite nice but nothing more than paraphrasing Kevin Kelly's ideas from 'New rules for a new economy'.I was doubting between 2 and 3 stars but since I did enjoy most of the read I give it 3 stars. On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend this book, go read Kevin Kelly instead.UPDATE: I just subtracted one star. I forgot to mention that it increasingly annoys me that these so called 'popular science' books tend to have pages and pages of useless appendices, bibliographies, indices etc. All are defendable in some way but to me it seems that they are just there to make the book look thicker or more voluminous. This book for example has about 40 pages (which is almost 20% of the number of pages of the actual story) with a 'Chronology of key innovations 1400-2000' ???????. There is absolutely no single bit of new information in there. What's next? Including a list of most used words in the book? 'Translation of the most important concepts into three forgotten languages'? Please include a link to a web page or something. Besides that the total number of pages is 326 of which about 245 are story."
2,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,4,"I first became acquainted with Where Good Ideas Come From through Steven Johnson's TED talk, which I highly recommend if you've got a spare 17 minutes. In that talk -- and the book -- Johnson argues that most people are wrong when they imagine where new, innovative ideas come from. Many people have in their mind a lone scientist working in his lab, suddenly arriving at a ""Eureka"" moment, perhaps with a proverbial light bulb over their head. It's the apple falling on Isaac Newton, or Darwin developing the idea of the survival of the fittest while reading Malthus.The only problem is that it's wrong.Through this book, Johnson points out that most innovative ideas come not from the brilliant lightbulb moment of a lone genius but rather through slow hunches cultivated for months, years, or decades over liquid networks. One of the reasons why big cities are so much more innovative than small towns is that you have more diversity, more ""spillover"" of ideas, and more chance for the ideas to mingle around together. Ideas don't appear whole-cloth, but often develop slowly, as the scientist or inventor keeps them on the back burner while pursuing other interests. One day, perhaps, he encounters someone else with another ""slow hunch,"" and they click and complete each other. Johnson points to other features that tend to nurture innovation, like making lots of mistakes and stealing ideas from other domains (the Gutenberg printing press relied on Rhineland wine-press technology).If you like, you can read through this book as a guide to making your own life or your company more innovative. There are even a few guidelines: take lots of walks (to expose yourself to different stimuli), write everything down, expose yourself to different ideas and disciplines as much as you can, having diverse hobbies, let other people build upon your ideas. But even if you do none of these things, Where Good Ideas Come From is a fascinating look at how we got where we are, and is well worth the read."
3,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,2,"I tend to avoid reading this kind of book. The Cluetrain Manifesto, The Tipping Point, Freakonomics, The Black Swan. They all hit the web, and they all pass me by in a largely undifferentiated wash of bold typography, sentence-length sub-titles and (too) easily summarised central points.I'm not sure now why I ordered 'Where good ideas come from' at the library, but having done so, I dutifully picked it up and settled in to read it over the long weekend. The double line spacing immediately gave me the sense that I was reading an extended blog post, and by and large, reaching the end of the book hasn't much changed my first reaction.Johnson identifies seven key situations or characteristics and one key context that foster innovation. The introduction defines that context: the city. In the same way that a coral reef nurtures a vast biodiversity compared to the same square meterage of empty sea, closely packed urban environments nurture in one discipline are more likely to come into contact with ideas from another. From here we tumble through the seven situations/contexts:The adjacent possible The phrase comes from scientist Stuart Kauffman, and describes the situation in which life originated on Earth. At one time, Earth was awash with a small number of simple molecules. Each of these could combine with the others in a finite number of ways, given certain catalysts, and then go on recombining and catalysing. This handful of simple molecules couldn't transform over night into a dandelion or an ostrich, because a whole bunch of innovations have to happen before then (like respiration). But surrounding each instance of each molecule was the adjacent possible - a slightly hazy boundary of what might happen. With each combination and transformation, the boundaries of the adjacent possible become bigger. Innovation fuels innovation.Liquid networks Information and ideas travel best in liquid networks. Scientific breakthroughs occur not just in the lab setting - perhaps not even most often in the lab setting - but in discussion groups and cafeterias, where different perspectives can be brought to bear on a set of findings, or the 'error' in an experiment can be revised into proof for another concept. From here we move into modular office design, blah blah blah.The slow hunch Ideas brew over time. Evidence is slowly gathered. Hunches work when they're connected to other bits of experience and evidence: this is why the Phoenix memo about 'suspicious persons' enrolling at American flight schools in mid 2001 didn't trigger any alerts that might have prevented 9/11 :it was filed into the FBI electronic black box, which is structured to prevent pieces of information from rubbing up against each otherSerendipity The chapter heading pretty much sums it up, although Johnson does a nice job of rebutting the argument that the web, and in particular being able to search for information, has driven serendipity out of our lives. Also - stop working, go for a walk, it might help you process information better than labouring over it.Error Some inventions are the outcome of wrong outcome after wrong outcome after wrong outcome. The guy who invented vacuum tubes did so without ever figuring out how they actually worked. Xrays and daguerreotypes were both accidental discoveries. You get the picture.ExaptationThis is where Johnson draws heavily on the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Exaptation is when an adaptation is further utlised for another end. Feathers were originally evolved to provide insulation: down feathers continue to perform this function, whereas flight feathers act as airfoils. An idea or finding from one field can be adapted into another. It's like the notion of weak ties (""popularised by Malcolm Gladwell"") but somehow betterPlatforms Stacked platforms don't just help information move; they recycle and amplify it. Coral reefs, beavers' dams, satellites and APIs. Government as platform. Twitter twitter twitter. You know the drill (or you don't, in which case this chapter might be a real eye-opener for you: the kind of thing you make your dumb-ass Web Strategy Advisory Group read so they'll go hey, yeah, go ahead, API everything!)In the final chapter, 'The Fourth Quandrant', Johnson proposes two ways of investigating and visualising the history and conditions of innovation. One is the deep drill-down into a single case-study, where you hope the reader will take the points you're making and extrapolate them out. His book on Joseph Priestly and the 'invention' of oxygen is such an example. The second is to go wide, and try to categorise millennia or centuries of innovation and look for trends (as Johnson does here, looking at the speeding up of innovation before and after the establishment of cities, and looking at the last 500 years of invention in terms of individual vs. collaborative/distributed invention, and market vs. open contexts).The book is subtitled 'The natural history of innovation', and Johnson like to reach down into the primordial soup* of neurons and evolution to draw parallels to human innovation. Darwin is his key motif; his musing on coral atolls open the book, and he is returned to frequently, on topics like slow hunches, serendipity and error. The thing is, I know my Gould. I've got a bit of a grip on Darwin. And recently, Nick Lane has thoroughly schooled me on evolution. While it's always a satisfying feeling to play 'snap' with an author (ah hah! I know that reference. I see your observation, and raise you this contradictory hypothesis!), I felt like all this bolstering was (a) a bit of a stretch - are neuron networks really like well-planned open offices? and (b) light weight compared to the reams and reams and reams of information that are out there - Johnson's few pages on the advantages of sexual reproduction compared to Lane's chapter, for example.As a result, a lot of the book felt familiar, and often a little thin compared to richer examples of many of the topics that I've read elsewhere. Perhaps ironically then, the one theme I wish Johnson had focused on in more depth - perhaps even written about exclusively - was that of the commonplace book, the tradition of writers and thinkers keeping notebooks full of passages and quotations, mixed in with observations and recordings of their own. The commonplace book lay somewhere between self-help book, memory tool, encyclopedia, and meditative device. (Montaigne kept one, naturally, and also had his favourite passages inscribed on the rafters of his library.)The English philosopher and physician John Locke started his first commonplace book in 1652, during his first year at Oxford. Over time he developed a method for indexing these books, a method he felt sufficiently important to warrant writing up as an appendix to his major work, 'An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'. Working within the limits of two pages in each commonplace book being reserved for the index, which had to swell to encompass whatever he transcribed into it, he structured his index in this way:When I meet with any thing, that I think fit to out into my common place book, I first find a proper head. Suppose for example that the head be EPISTOLA, I ook unto the index for the first letter and the following vowel which in this instance are E.i. if in the space marked E.i. there is any number that directs me to the page designed for words that begin with an E and whose first vowel after the initial letter is I, I must then write under the word Epistola in that page what I have to remark.Even I recognise the 'if X, then Y' pattern of storing and retrieving data going on here. The commonplace book both stores information and allows one to retrieve it, and in the process of doing so, revisit and enrich the ideas once has already had.From Locke, Joseph Priestly, and Erasmus Darwin, Johnson steps through to 'Enquire Within Upon Everything', a hugely popular Victorian how-to guide for everything from making flowers in wax to burying relatives. Tim Berners Lee named the first iteration of what would the world wide web 'Enquire' after a copy of this manual he remembered from his childhood.Johnson himself uses DevonThink, an app that allows him to store and search texts, which has a search algorithm that forges relationships between them. It's interesting to see him recounting using Devon Think as a writing tool:I write a paragraph about something - let's say about the human brain's remarkable facility for interpreting facial expressions. I then plug that paragraph into the software, and ask DevonThink to find other passages in my archive that are similar. Instantly, a list of quotes appears on my screen ... Invariably, one or two of these triggers a new association in my head ... and so I select that quote, and ask the software to find a new batch of passages similar to it. Before long, a larger idea takes shape in my head, built upon the trail of association the machine has assembled for me.[Apropos this, I found a lovely article over summer called The Theatre of Memory, about libraries as more than data storage, you should totally read it.]So all up: I think this might be one of those reviews that means you don't need to read the book yourself, unless you having a burning desire to do so. Instead, go out and read Nick Lane, and Steven Jay Gould, and all sorts of other people writing about all sorts of other good things - that's where the good ideas come from.*I read an essay recently by Michael Chabon where he talked about how he'll get obsessed with a word, and for days on end he'll have to fit the words 'monkeys' or 'washer' into conversation over and over again. He said this slipped into his published writing - an unusual word, say 'shrivelled', will appear twenty times in a single book, and occasionally get picked up by readers. Someone needed to go through 'Where good ideas come from' and edit out every second instance of the phrase 'primordial soup'. "
4,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5669954-taras,3,"This book can be summarized as - where good ideas die. I expected to book to serve as a guide as how inventions evolved into new inventions. Instead the book turned out to be a cross between something like a business book ""how to foster new ideas"" and a self-help one ""how to be more inventive"". The fact that it's written by a yuppie Silicon Valley entrepreneur makes it that much more difficult to stomach - the book raves about twitter as a platform and plugs some data-mining wares the author is peddling.All of the above would lead to a one-star review (I'm so disappointed in The Economist for recommending this) if it were not for the discussion of ""adjacent possible"". I recommend that people read ""Chapter 1: The Adjacent Possible"" and skip the rest of the book. In this chapter the author convincingly argues that the pop culture notion of a genius inventor is bullshit. As proof the author presents numerous important inventions that were invented by multiple people around the same time. There is a follow up chapter on how ideas usually don't strike like lighting, they often take decades to develop.The book itself is very short, the last quarter of the book is padding consisting of author's notes, listing important inventions, etc. The list of inventions is somewhat random. Invention descriptions are overly brief and unsatisfying. The following notes section is evidence that the author is good at research and sucks at turning that into prose."
5,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"This is a very insightful survey of the elements that make innovation possible. The ideas are all taken from a variety of other sources, but Steven Johnson organizes them into a nice framework. There are seven chapters with titles such as 'The Slow Hunch', 'Serendipity', 'Error', etc., but most of them get at the same thing: new ideas flourish best when they are allowed to flow through a network and come in contact with each other. Most of the author's arguments seem self-evident, but he really backs them up nicely with real-life case studies and adds some nuanced insights.I’ve read his earlier book, The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World, and in my review of that book, I complained that the author grasps too desperately at a grand philosophical point instead of just telling a good story. After reading this book, I understand where he was coming from and what motivates his thinking. I'm especially sympathetic because his outlook very closely aligns with mine, and his stated motivation for writing those books is exactly why I like to read them. He likes to do a 'deep dive' into a specific invention as a way to extrapolate an understanding of how ideas develop in general. This book really explains what he was trying to get at with his earlier books. The author says as much explicitly in the acknowledgements - he sees it as a sort of concluding volume in a trilogy that includes The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World and The Invention of Air: A Story of Science, Faith, Revolution, and the Birth of America. After this book, I'd really like to complete the 'trilogy' and read 'The Invention of Air'.A weakness of the book, which is probably the publisher’s fault, is that it smacks too much of the glib business advice you find in many bestselling management books; for example, the ideal office layout to cultivate innovative thinking in a company. Boring. I have a feeling he was forced to include that by his publisher, so they can market it as a business book and boost sales.However, the biggest weakness by far of the entire book was the final chapter entitled 'The Fourth Quadrant'. He tries to prove that market forces are not a particularly strong element in encouraging innovation. To prove it, he makes a list of what he considers 'good ideas': 'Washing Machine', 'Absolute zero', 'Accelerating expansion of the universe', 'Pencil', 'Piano', 'E=mc2', etc. and counts how many of them fall into each of one of four quadrants: 'Market/Individual', 'Market/Networked', 'Non-market/Individual', and 'Non-market/Networked'. He then goes to show that most good ideas fall into what he calls the 'Fourth Quarter': Non-market/Networked. The resulting study is sheer stupidity. For starters, he doesn't clearly define his criteria for classifying ideas as market/non-market or individual/networked. Does 'market' mean motivated by profit while non-market means motivated by the greater good? For example, he classifies the piano as non-market/individual. Why? The Appendix offers a clue: because the inventor was employed by the Medici court. That's a weak argument. The inventor clearly indented to get paid. Another example: the light bulb is market/networked. Why is it not 'individual' which the author defines as ‘a small co-ordinated team'? Because it was simultaneously invented by multiple other inventors? That doesn't make sense - many inventions are like this and he includes them in other quadrants. Plus, as the rest of the book makes clear, the key insight of many of these good ideas was to apply it in a novel way. All inventions are networked by this definition. And then, the author mixes scientific discoveries - like the accelerating expansion of the universe, or E=mc2 together with technological inventions, which doesn’t make sense. Science is often done outside the corporate system. Then there's also the issue that many of these inventions were accidents but subsequently commercialized to great success. Does that make them 'non-market'? This also severely overestimates scientific ideas, because a single technological invention relies on numerous individual scientific components.In short, this last chapter ends up being a confusing mess, and completely silly. I think what the author is trying to get at (as the end of the chapter makes clear) is that patents don't encourage innovation; they stifle it. That would have been a much more interesting discussion. Patents is an interesting topic. Instead, the author conflates that discussion with 'the market' and gets completely side-tracked due to his weak understanding of that ‘the market’ is. A much more insightful analysis of 'the market' comes from the author himself, in chapter 2 (Liquid Networks) in his discussion of the invention of double-entry accounting (page 57):""...when economic systems shift from feudal structures to the nascent forms of modern capitalism, they become less hierarchical and more networked. A society organized around marketplaces, instead of castles or cloisters, distributes decision-making authority across a much larger network of individual minds. The innovation power of the marketplace derives, in part, from this most elemental math: no matter how smart the ""authorities"" may be, if they are outnumbered a thousand to one by the marketplace, there will be more good ideas lurking in the market than in the feudal castle. Cities and markets recruit more minds into the collective project of exploring the adjacent possible...""As good as an argument against central planning and in defence of a distributed market economy (i.e. capitalism) as any. These ideas are very similar to what Matt Ridley talks about in his books and talks. Johnson draws on Ridley a little in this book, but mostly from his book on sex. Johnson would do well to read Ridley’s work and incorporate those ideas into his thinking.Despite those weaknesses, the merits of the earlier chapters are overwhelming and this book is packed with many good ideas for such a small book."
6,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,5,"Have you ever heard with half an ear how Leibniz and Newton discovered calculus around the same time? That the same happened for Oxygen? The light bulb? The telephone? Jet engine? Even the transistor? Imagine a place where each door leads to a room with more doors. That's scientific exploration. Movable type, paper, ink, and the wine press had each opened doors, and Gutenberg found himself in a place to invent the printing press. If he hadn't done it, someone else would. Throughout history, this has happened 1,000s of times. Johnson, quoting Kauffman, calls the space of what's possible given the doors we now have opened the 'adjacent possible.' This can be a simultaneous encouraging and depressing thought... is everything then inevitable?The adjacent possible gives us a nice way to think about timing. Something that's ""too early"" is something that's leaping too many generations into the adjacent possible (there's also an aspect of maturity involved). Bell invented the picture-phone in the 70s, but it was just not worth it to have a phone-booth size thing in your home. Many attempted massive multi-player online games in the 90s, but home bandwidth, latency, etc. wasn't ready. Of course, it's possible to push through many generations of the adjacent possible rapidly: Manhatten Project, Apollo, Micro-processors, etc.This by far was the most interesting aspect of the book to me, but it's riddled with good observations by someone who's clearly devoured many pages on scientific history, leaned back, and written this book as a discourse on the big picture. The adjacent possible is just one chapter I've chosen to highlight of many on other patterns in the history of innovation."
7,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"There are really only two core ideas in this book: 1. That innovations are best modeled as ideas having sex, in the sense that they don't pop into existence but instead each idea is formed by the process of mixing elements from previous ideas (recombination), or slightly improving on an aspect of the idea (mutation). This view makes all of our innovations look similar to intellectual animals, with their own family trees. And 2. That these innovations don't happen in sudden eureka moments inside the mind of one person, but instead happen over time through ""slow hunches"" that incubate inside an obsessed mind, while that mind is engaged in liquid networks of other minds.These two core tenants are supported with several briefly-discussed fun historical examples. However, I think the book could have been slightly shorter, it rambles a bit and stretches some assertions a bit, but overall it gives some food for thought. 3/5."
8,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"I love origin stories. I especially love the ones that are about some familiar product or invention that I know and use, but if there’s a good story behind something I don't use – like that the glass eye was invented by a doll maker whose grandchild lost an eye in an accident – I’m interested. So I’ve read quite a few books on innovation over the years, but this one was something unique. Those others have more anecdotes and “pop” appeal. This one had more hard science. That made it both more scholarly and a more challenging read. A warning to my religious friends: this author is a Darwinist. He opens up with Darwin’s observations on the variety of life forms to be found in a coral reef and extrapolates the analogy to human environments where ideas can thrive and grow, like cities and the World Wide Web. He uses other analogies from the theory of evolution throughout the book, namely, “the lucky accident” as opposed to the “argument from design.” Now, I welcome the idea of embracing error as part of progress. The testing culture of our schools makes us way too afraid of being wrong, and not only does it inhibit creativity, it doesn’t reflect the real world. Nobody makes progress without trial and error. But I find it very hard to believe that dinosaurs evolved feathers for warmth, even though feathers just happen to be perfectly structured for flight, and the dinosaurs discovered this by experimental movements. Yes, the discovery of penicillin was one lucky accident. But the feather thing is pushing it. Even still, I can’t give the book less than a five even though some parts went right over my head. My favorite part was learning about the “commonplace notebooks” or journals the Enlightenment thinkers used to keep of their reading. It sounded just like Goodreads, and it got me to write in my hand journal again for the first time in months. But the coolest part was that someone who read one of those notebooks as a child was instrumental in designing the web as we know it. (That was in the chapter called “The Slow Hunch.” From a seemingly unrelated train of thoughts, brilliant connections can arise if you wait long enough.)My other favorite part was the Appendix at the end in which the author gives short chronological summaries of inventions and discoveries from the Middle Ages to the present. He credited Charles Townes and not Gordon Gould for the invention of the laser, but fine, no author can be perfect. So Darwinism aside, I probably will read more from Steven Johnson. He’s got plenty to teach."
9,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,2,"This book fell completely flat on me, like a sheet of plywood, and it was just as enjoyable. Even though one of the big explanations of where ""new ideas"" come from is that they come from jostling together with disparate other notions, like marbles in a can, I don't love that this book is jostling together a bunch of other people's ideas and science, somehow trying to become readable, accessible, and clever."
10,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5248657-david,4,"I picked up this book after hearing Steven Johnson's interview on CBC's Spark. His arguments are compelling, and the book is chock full of invention origin stories - a very interesting read!"
11,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/831094-kristine,4,"I won this book from Goodreads. This is a fascinating book I would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in creativity and the history of the ideas that changed our world and the way we interact with it. He tackles the similarities in how ideas form, from Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection to the internet and twitter. Johnson's writing is tight and engaging--his ideas scream for contemplation and incorporation into one's intellectual life, yet I found it difficult to pull myself away. Definitely a book I'll be re-reading--and don't even ask to borrow my copy.As a scientists especially, I appreciated his treatment of the collaborative nature of ideas and innovations especially. May of the best, most innovative ideas in science come out of collaborations, not from the apocryphal lone scientist toiling away in a secluded lab. Certainly, a breakthrough can happen to someone working alone, but he makes a compelling argument that interaction with others, or at the very least broad exposure to ideas, fertilizes the mind, priming it for creativity. Johnson presents the best justification for conference attendance ever.I only had a couple of criticisms that pulled this down from a five star to a four star. He mentions the importance of the commonplace book--essentially a diary for ideas--and then essentially advertises his own favorite version of a digital commonplace book (from DEVONthink) for the remainder of the chapter. While I'm sure the DEVONthink product is a good one, and I'm glad to know such products exist (since I'd never have thought to even look for one on my own) I'm sure there are other systems out there for taking notes and organizing ideas that would be equally good. That minor quibble aside, I really enjoyed this book! "
12,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8749228-candice-carpenter,4,"Within the first 20 pages, I was hooked with this book. For anyone with an entrepreneurial bent or fiendish desire to understand the workings of innovation and creativity, this is the book for you. Johnson elegantly and eloquently debunks the so-called myth of the lone genius innovating in a vacuum. Instead, he asserts that several underlying principles --of serendipity, error, liquid networks, and adjacent possibilities--help to propel new inventions. Some of the inspirational thoughts that came to mind when I read his book are: open-source communities can have profound effects on technological, educational, and social aspects of our lives, if properly leveraged; we can make ourselves more interconnected to various diverse networks (be they intellectual, social, cultural, or otherwise) to become more creative and inventive; deep dive reading sabbaticals are not just for socially sanctioned geniuses like Bill Gates, but for people like me who want to creatively catalyze their thinking and productivity. "
13,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915595-stephen-brownell,5,"The first few chapters especially are just incredible. Amazing concepts clearly presented. Johnson is an entertaining polymath with a highly compelling view of why things work the way they do.His use of the word ""ideas"" in the title implies a more narrow focus than what is presented. By ""ideas"" he means something bigger than what we're associating it with, particularly human ideas. The idea of evolution, of the formation of life, of why cities are more productive than rural areas per capita. The ideas and concepts that quietly govern our surroundings and environments with or without our knowledge.Highly recommend."

15,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"This book shows that “good ideas” (or key innovations) are generally products of prior discoveries, experimentation, and collaboration, not the Eureka moments of isolated geniuses. I found the historical anecdotes interesting and the lessons somewhat insightful, but overall the book wasn’t especially fascinating. I also felt that Johnson’s repeated comparisons of human ingenuity to evolutionary ecology were stretching the metaphor and didn’t contribute to his points. My favorite chapter was The Fourth Quadrant, which explores innovation in market-based (profit-seeking) and non-market-based environments.The book’s last paragraph gives advice on having good ideas, which is a concise summary of the book: “Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent.”The appendix contains an interesting chronology of key innovations from 1400-2000 AD, which shows that many innovations were discovered independently by separate innovators, and that many were based on years of research built on previous ideas.I read this because it was listed in .net Magazine’s The top 50 books for web designers and developers. The list has since been updated, and no longer includes it.The Adjacent Possible• Good ideas are constrained by the “parts” (physical or conceptual materials) and skills that surround them.• Ideas are limited by the “adjacent possible”; the realm of options made reachable by previous ideas.• The best environments for creating good ideas are those that help people expose the adjacent possible, by exposing a diverse sample of mechanical or conceptual parts, and encouraging novel ways of recombining them.• Bad environments punish experimentation, obscure branches of possibility, and make the current state so satisfying that no one explores.• To have good ideas, don’t sit in isolation and think big thoughts; get more “parts” on the table.Liquid NetworksIt’s not the wisdom of the crowd, but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. Individuals get smarter because they’re connected to a social network.The Slow HunchHunches need space and time to evolve.SerendipityHow to trigger serendipitous thoughts: go for a walk, take a shower or bath, read, get away from work and tasks.ErrorsErrors force us to rethink our biases and contemplate alternatives, spurring innovation.ExaptationGreat innovators have many hobbies, and ideas from different projects make connections that lead to insights.The Fourth Quadrant• “Market-based competition has no monopoly on innovation. Competition and the profit motive do indeed motivate us to turn good ideas into shipping products, but more often than not, the ideas themselves come from somewhere else.”• From the 1800s on, innovation has increasingly taken place in collaborative groups (“collective invention”), inside and outside the market.• Why do some good ideas flourish without economic incentives? Non-market environments are more efficient because they’re more open than market environments, which have barriers like copyright, patents, and trade secrets. People can focus on creating new ideas rather than spend time and money protecting old ones."

This current text probes the various methods in which innovations evolve, since contrary to popular belief they don't occur in a vacuum or eureka moments. Based on his research, Johnson has broken innovation into seven segments of development; the adjacent possible, liquid networks, the slow hunch, serendipity, error, exaptation, and platforms. In each method, Johnson provided detailed theory and supporting examples about how ideas formed through the process. While occasionally laborious for those unfamiliar with his scientific references, his insight into the environment of innovations builds in a similar fashion to his thoughts on liquid networks and the slow hunch. What he provides is his own primordial soup on how to best cultivate innovation. His emphasis is not a formula to garner success, but a suggestion of the pieces needed to provide the most fertile ground. While his prose does not lend itself to sound bites, this book provides services focus and insight into a topic that challenges the business world and science alike and is a key to those who wish to champion any innovation initiative."""

The illustrations are vivid and memorable, which help me remember the difference components of an innovative ecosystem. This is definitely the kind of book that I like to have on hand and lend to people.1. Adjacent Possible - Good ideas are built from a collection of existing parts, the following six patterns assemble a wider variety of spare parts2. Platforms - Creating a generative environment where different kinds of thought can productively collide and recombine3. Liquid Networks - To create a good idea, the environment needs to be densely populated with ideas but capable of adopting new configurations4. The Slow Hunch - Good ideas are a series of small hunches that come together over a long time5. Serendipity - Hunches require environments where surprising new connections can be forged over time6. Error - Innovations often come from unexpected results because error creates a path out of your comfortable assumptions7. Exaptation - Taking on one evolution of an idea for another purpose: recombining, often through diverse, horizontal social networks where you act as a bridge between tight clusters"

Johnson takes a diverse number of subjects and shows the parallels between them, drawing strong comparisons between human engineered systems and naturally evolved systems, particularly their generative power. Written in a conversational lecture mode, the topics covered in this book are understandable for anyone from high school on up.The best part of the book is the conclusion. Although it was a bit long, Johnson drew some interesting conclusions and tied all the themes together in a very satisfying way. The reason it stands out for me, however, is that he starts with a story that seems to disprove his point and then carefully shows that his conclusions, while good, are not the only method of good innovation. This is a book that seeks to elucidate and enlighten, not spout doctrine.In the end, I cannot recommend this highly enough for a wide range of people: engineers, managers, scientists, sociologists, and all those who are just curious about the world around them.Disclaimer: I won this book for free through FirstReads."
19,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3672995-parker,4,"Regardless of its origin, sometimes a good idea forms the entire basis of a non-fiction book. Often this idea is capable of being summed up in a single pithy sentence which serves as the title--maybe ""The Tipping Point,"" or ""The Long Tail,""--and after the concept is explained in the first few paragraphs, chapters full of anecdotes flesh out the work to book length, business publications praise it, and the author can command some serious speaking fees at conferences and corporate events.Where Good Ideas Come From looks a lot like that kind of book, but I'm happy to say it isn't. It's a short book, especially if you don't count a long appendix, but Johnson makes about six or seven really solid points that are each interesting and worth thinking about. Of course, there are plenty of anecdotes for illustration, but a majority were unfamiliar to me and well told.I'm not sure this book is a classic or anything, but it's definitely an entertaining read, and could certainly provide a spark to a creative person who is having trouble conceptualizing the process of having an idea.

The single most important book for anyone looking for an accurate and comprehensive description of the creative process that they have heretofore been unable to verbalize. Johnson breaks creativity down to 7 basic underlying principles: the adjacent possible, liquid networks, slow hunch, serendipity, error, exaptation, and platforms. In doing so, he not only allows readers to become more conscious of the patterns that creativity follows, but he also provides inspiring examples of the principles in action. Cases like the invention of the Internet (the ultimate liquid network, and the preeminent platform), the exaptation of car parts into incubators that third world citizens understand how to maintain (adjacent possible), and the FBI's pre-9/11 antiterrorist unit (slow hunches that failed to materialize because of frozen, nonliquid networks) will inspire your creativity in ways you may not even consciously know are possible. If you need any kind of creative inspiration (business, art, etc.), read this book! This book will hopefully be the inspiration of my own successful business venture, and could be for yours.

I really liked the examples that Johnson uses: instead of focusing on business ideas, which I guess is what most people would associate with innovation, he brings examples from the history of science and from biological evolution, making it all seem one coherent picture.The author presents 7 (or 8, depending on your count) characteristics of an innovation-friendly environment. Three of them stuck with me:- liquid networks - progress doesn't happen if your physical and intellectual network is too strict (a solid network, or the overused principle of ""if it ain't broken, don't fix it""), but it's also impeded by an environment that is too chaotic (a gaseous network, where new ideas find it hard to take root);- the adjacent possible - while ""ideas ahead of their time"" do exist, most innovation happens ""when it's supposed to"" because it straddles the boundary between what is and what isn't just yet;- the slow hunch - the Eureka moment is, more often than not, the result of a long process of gathering ideas, connecting them and ""sleeping on it""; this is why he also recommends keeping a journal of discoveries and thoughts and perusing it occasionally, since you never know which piece of information triggers a new connection in your head."

I think this book needed a brutal editor to keep it focused rather than rambling. My take-away from the book is that encountering lots of different ideas, working with people who are different from you, and generally being curious and cooperative are the ways to have good ideas. It makes me want to find the time to socialize around some of my hobbies or creative endeavors rather than trying to go it alone or perfect it by myself.

What I instead discovered was a paradigm shift in thinking. Part history, part opinion, Johnson delivers a framework for understanding ecosystems. The interconnecting strands that hold our universe together in both the material, and social fabrics of modern society. Exploring the reef as a metaphor; a case is made for coexistence in perpetuity, interdependence and serendipity as chaos to create the ‘new’, through means of ‘adjacent possible’, and putting more parts on the table. Funnelling ‘chaos’ and instead perceiving it as a chemical catalyst to create new mental models which form innovative new concepts. As a self-proclaimed ‘polymath’, this book gave me a framework to understand the web that holds our world together, and how to positively contribute to it with the adjacent possibles that present themselves as choices and variables in day to day living. I was not expecting how profound this book would reveal itself to be, and am glad to have had the pleasure of gaining an almost boundless amount of value from it. "

The author breaks this into six different areas pertinent to innovation - ideas come from 'adjacent possible' areas, 'liquid networks' provide conducive environments, how 'slow hunches' develop over a long time, there is role for 'serendipity', 'errors' should be welcomed, alternate uses come through 'exaptation' and 'platforms' are powerful. These concepts are well defined and the stories and examples make the book an interesting read. At times, the thread from the story to the concept that it was meant to illustrate is not well drawn as it could have been. The author uses many examples from nature in the book, as said in the title, but the evolutionary aspect of nature cannot be confused with the intentional element of innovation for humans that the book seems to target. The author does mention this, but a bit too lightly. If we recognize that, this is a worthwhile read."

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric.

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

42,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.0) Analogies to the natural world aside, some interesting insight actionable advice for fostering innovationSomewhat entertaining. An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

44,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
45,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
46,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
47,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
48,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
49,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Every year the Website Edge poses a question to thinkers in a variety of fields. The 2011 question submitted by Steven Pinker with some input from Daniel Kahneman is “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkits?” See http://edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html , to see the responses. And if you are interested in acquiring scientific concepts to improve your thinking, read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From. It’s full of thought models like the adjacent possible, liquid networks and the slow hunch that have relevance for any real life circumstance or academic discipline. I read this first as a borrowed e-book from my library but some of the graphics were hard to see.

My own PhD advisor said himself that his ideas never came from isolation, they came from going out into the world and talking to other people! This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again. Gave me good ideas for my research lab. Weekly meetings are are important! Write everything down. Get exposed to lots of other ideas. Try to find tangential or unorthodox connections between information. Make sure your ideas get out there so people can help improve them. I already do these things, but good to teach to students!"

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."
55,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898018-jonathan,3,"This book started well but the premise began to feel a little slight as the book progressed. I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."

The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

It started out really interesting and I was excited to talk about it with Michael, but by the end, Johnson's ideas felt stretched and his theories of where good ideas come from felt a bit forced.

There was also a bit of blatant self promotion of his other books and side projects--""speaking of good ideas, I had an awesome one and you should go check it out"".

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

74,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
75,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
76,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
77,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
78,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
79,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again.

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male.

I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words.

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

104,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
105,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
106,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
107,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
108,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
109,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes.

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"
114,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,3,"This book contains a handful of mildly interesting/useful concepts for people seeking to boost creativity at work or at play. It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."
115,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898018-jonathan,3,"This book started well but the premise began to feel a little slight as the book progressed. I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."
116,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2966570-frank-kelly,3,"I recently heard Johnson speak at a conference in Chicago on this topic in the context of the growth of cities. An excellent and quite humorous speaker. His book read much like a long and insightful essay, populated with a series of fascinating insights on a host of innovations and inventions -- some that have radically changed how we live and others that, well, have not but are interesting nontheless. It is hard to categorize this book -- not really a business book, certaintly not a management book. Rather, it is what it says it is: A concise history of innovation. "

And topical since our political and social environment is stressing innovation and entrepreneurship (not the same thing, however!) as the key to economic regain. My one critique is that the author focused very heavily on the development of scientific innovations. What about social ones? How does social innovation distinguish itself or relate to some of processes behind the technological advances Johnson describes? With this in mind, I feel like there is a missing chapter or two...."
118,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5599078-gayatri-sriram,5,"A brilliant look at ideas and innovation that have changed the game. Johnson uses case studies that we all know and admire but relays an enchanting account of where they came from. By comparing our workplace/city/ or any place that requires ideation to a coral reef, he establishes the ideal environment for churning out million dollar ideas; open liquid networks. The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."

Some mechanisms are self-evident, but a few are really fascinating - in particular regarding the role of chaos, randomness and error in innovation.

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

There was also a bit of blatant self promotion of his other books and side projects--""speaking of good ideas, I had an awesome one and you should go check it out"".

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

134,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
135,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
136,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
137,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
138,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
139,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Every year the Website Edge poses a question to thinkers in a variety of fields. The 2011 question submitted by Steven Pinker with some input from Daniel Kahneman is “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkits?” See http://edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html , to see the responses. And if you are interested in acquiring scientific concepts to improve your thinking, read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From. It’s full of thought models like the adjacent possible, liquid networks and the slow hunch that have relevance for any real life circumstance or academic discipline. I read this first as a borrowed e-book from my library but some of the graphics were hard to see. I’ve since purchased the hardbound version because the ideas that it presents are one I know I’ll want to come back to."

My own PhD advisor said himself that his ideas never came from isolation, they came from going out into the world and talking to other people! This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again. Gave me good ideas for my research lab. Weekly meetings are are important! Write everything down. Get exposed to lots of other ideas. Try to find tangential or unorthodox connections between information. Make sure your ideas get out there so people can help improve them. I already do these things, but good to teach to students!"

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male.

I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

164,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
165,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
166,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
167,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
168,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
169,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Every year the Website Edge poses a question to thinkers in a variety of fields. The 2011 question submitted by Steven Pinker with some input from Daniel Kahneman is “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkits?” See http://edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html , to see the responses. And if you are interested in acquiring scientific concepts to improve your thinking, read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From. It’s full of thought models like the adjacent possible, liquid networks and the slow hunch that have relevance for any real life circumstance or academic discipline. I read this first as a borrowed e-book from my library but some of the graphics were hard to see. I’ve since purchased the hardbound version because the ideas that it presents are one I know I’ll want to come back to."

My own PhD advisor said himself that his ideas never came from isolation, they came from going out into the world and talking to other people! This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again. Gave me good ideas for my research lab. Weekly meetings are are important! Write everything down. Get exposed to lots of other ideas. Try to find tangential or unorthodox connections between information. Make sure your ideas get out there so people can help improve them. I already do these things, but good to teach to students!"

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."

I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."

An excellent and quite humorous speaker. His book read much like a long and insightful essay, populated with a series of fascinating insights on a host of innovations and inventions -- some that have radically changed how we live and others that, well, have not but are interesting nontheless. It is hard to categorize this book -- not really a business book, certaintly not a management book. Rather, it is what it says it is: A concise history of innovation. "

And topical since our political and social environment is stressing innovation and entrepreneurship (not the same thing, however!) as the key to economic regain. My one critique is that the author focused very heavily on the development of scientific innovations. What about social ones? How does social innovation distinguish itself or relate to some of processes behind the technological advances Johnson describes? With this in mind, I feel like there is a missing chapter or two...."

Johnson uses case studies that we all know and admire but relays an enchanting account of where they came from. By comparing our workplace/city/ or any place that requires ideation to a coral reef, he establishes the ideal environment for churning out million dollar ideas; open liquid networks. The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."

Two things we have in abundance on this planet right now are pollution and seawater. Why not try to build a city out of them?]I may not be able to turn my government into a coral reef, but i try to create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the region i inhabit; in my school; in my mind!As the author said:""Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent.

Some mechanisms are self-evident, but a few are really fascinating - in particular regarding the role of chaos, randomness and error in innovation.

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

194,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
195,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
196,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
197,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
198,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
199,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

200,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"An inspiring, couldn’t-put-it-down book about how to nurture insights and creativity. Every year the Website Edge poses a question to thinkers in a variety of fields. The 2011 question submitted by Steven Pinker with some input from Daniel Kahneman is “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkits?” See http://edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html , to see the responses. And if you are interested in acquiring scientific concepts to improve your thinking, read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From. It’s full of thought models like the adjacent possible, liquid networks and the slow hunch that have relevance for any real life circumstance or academic discipline. I read this first as a borrowed e-book from my library but some of the graphics were hard to see. I’ve since purchased the hardbound version because the ideas that it presents are one I know I’ll want to come back to."

My own PhD advisor said himself that his ideas never came from isolation, they came from going out into the world and talking to other people! This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again. Gave me good ideas for my research lab. Weekly meetings are are important! Write everything down. Get exposed to lots of other ideas. Try to find tangential or unorthodox connections between information. Make sure your ideas get out there so people can help improve them. I already do these things, but good to teach to students!"
202,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Nice conversational read. I added this in my trek through books on innovation and I'm glad I did. Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."
205,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898018-jonathan,3,"This book started well but the premise began to feel a little slight as the book progressed. I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."
206,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2966570-frank-kelly,3,"I recently heard Johnson speak at a conference in Chicago on this topic in the context of the growth of cities. An excellent and quite humorous speaker. His book read much like a long and insightful essay, populated with a series of fascinating insights on a host of innovations and inventions -- some that have radically changed how we live and others that, well, have not but are interesting nontheless. It is hard to categorize this book -- not really a business book, certaintly not a management book. Rather, it is what it says it is: A concise history of innovation. "

And topical since our political and social environment is stressing innovation and entrepreneurship (not the same thing, however!) as the key to economic regain. My one critique is that the author focused very heavily on the development of scientific innovations. What about social ones? How does social innovation distinguish itself or relate to some of processes behind the technological advances Johnson describes? With this in mind, I feel like there is a missing chapter or two...."

Johnson uses case studies that we all know and admire but relays an enchanting account of where they came from. By comparing our workplace/city/ or any place that requires ideation to a coral reef, he establishes the ideal environment for churning out million dollar ideas; open liquid networks. The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."

Some mechanisms are self-evident, but a few are really fascinating - in particular regarding the role of chaos, randomness and error in innovation.

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot.

But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring.

Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

It started out really interesting and I was excited to talk about it with Michael, but by the end, Johnson's ideas felt stretched and his theories of where good ideas come from felt a bit forced.

There was also a bit of blatant self promotion of his other books and side projects--""speaking of good ideas, I had an awesome one and you should go check it out"".

222,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.0) Analogies to the natural world aside, some interesting insight actionable advice for fostering innovationSomewhat entertaining. An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

224,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
225,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
226,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
227,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
228,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
229,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again.

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."

Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."

I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

254,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
255,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
256,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
257,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
258,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
259,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes.

Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"

It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."

I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."
266,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2966570-frank-kelly,3,"I recently heard Johnson speak at a conference in Chicago on this topic in the context of the growth of cities. An excellent and quite humorous speaker. His book read much like a long and insightful essay, populated with a series of fascinating insights on a host of innovations and inventions -- some that have radically changed how we live and others that, well, have not but are interesting nontheless. It is hard to categorize this book -- not really a business book, certaintly not a management book. Rather, it is what it says it is: A concise history of innovation. "

And topical since our political and social environment is stressing innovation and entrepreneurship (not the same thing, however!) as the key to economic regain. My one critique is that the author focused very heavily on the development of scientific innovations. What about social ones? How does social innovation distinguish itself or relate to some of processes behind the technological advances Johnson describes? With this in mind, I feel like there is a missing chapter or two...."

Johnson uses case studies that we all know and admire but relays an enchanting account of where they came from. By comparing our workplace/city/ or any place that requires ideation to a coral reef, he establishes the ideal environment for churning out million dollar ideas; open liquid networks. The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."

Some mechanisms are self-evident, but a few are really fascinating - in particular regarding the role of chaos, randomness and error in innovation.

Whereas ""Six Innovations"" was bursting with new ideas and compelling connections, ""Where Good Ideas Come From"" is repetitive. It rehashes and belabors its points until you're tempted to leave it unfinished. It's also a little annoying when a writer states, ""Almost everyone believes,"" or, ""We tend to assume"" about a point and then argues voraciously against it. Usually what he's saying is pretty clear.Another thing that bothered me: parts of the book were confusing. It's a teacher/writer's job to explain things simply, and it's not like the topics here were prohibitively esoteric. For some reason there's also a long list of inventions at the end of the book, many of them involving concepts that can't be explained in a few lines. So why bother attaching it in the first place?"

NotesOrganisms scale logarithmically, larger ones have slower heart rates and consequently live longer. Similarly, cities also scale up logarithmically (negative power law). On the other hand, creativity/innovation in cities is positive power law, these being environments that encourage more.Is invention inevitable? Natural selection, calculus, oxygen, telephone/telegraph, airplane. Some ideas are ahead of their time, like Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which lack the hardware/tools to fully materialize. Ideas are not lightbulbs but networks of neurons in the brain. Like innovation in the world, the key is to get as many tools onto the workdesk as possible.Carbon’s 4 valence electrons can make a huge variety of covalent bonds, and form long complex chains. While Si/Ge are in the same group, C is unique in its formation of double/triple bonds making it uniquely suited for building blocks of life. Similarly, H2O makes for a great soup, it has strong polar bonded O2, so remains liquid over a much larger range of temperatures that the earth experienced. It is a powerful solvent for proto-organics to play around in. Good analogy for ideas is states of matter: gases have too rarified interactions for any meaningful chain reactions, solids have too rigid structures, fluids are the most conducive, that’s why it’s called flow-state.Early hunter-gatherer bands were like gases, needed first proto-cities to achieve liquid form, rapid innovation seen. Similarly, medieval Italy was too rigid/solid, renaissance was move to liquid from opposite directionInnovation needs sweet spot between chaos (gas) and order (solid). Offices are usually too ordered. Open-spaces are too chaotic. MIT Building 22 was a good example of liquid, since it was temporary WW2 building, noone had compunctions with tearing down walls and writing on walls to accommodate new teams and flow of people/ideas.Phoenix memo outlined threat of Jihadists infiltrating flight-industry. Separately, Minnesota PD failed to get warrant to search terrorist who was flagged at flight-school and linked with WTC plot. If only ideas were allowed to cross-germinate like they do in cities, and internet.Darwin describes epiphany of evolution suddenly while having a Malthusian idea. But diaries suggest he’s been cultivating idea of natural selection over a long period. Joseph Priestley had been cultivating idea of O2 as life-giving gas over 20 years of observations. Darwin wrote his far-ranging ideas in a commonplace book, a practice that had picked up in Enlightenment Europe, a personal encyclopaedia that allowed chaotic mixing of ideas as well as ordered retrieval (collection but not categorization). This was the inspiration for Tim Berners Lee, who simmered with this idea through a conducive environment of CERN. Google that actively encouraged cross-fertilization of ideas. Engineer was inspired by 9/11 intelligence failure to create algo that would properly categorize and retrieve articles. Google news was born within 1 year. 10 years after their institutional mess-up, the FBI was still using the same filing systems, that funnelled information and kept secrets within units. Kekule dreamed up the benzene ring. So did experimenter who proved chemical substrate involved in nervous system (acetylcholine slowed down frog’s heart, and adrenaline sped it up, the chemicals were stimulated by electricity to vagus nerve, and flowed through the solvent and affected the frog’s heart that was not stimulated). Dreams are exploring new connections, some of them stick. This works when you’re already working on a single long-incubation idea. Poincare describes most of his breakthroughs during walks, other non-related activities. Serendipity by Horace Walpole referring to Persian tale 3 princes of Serendip who are always making marvelous discoveries. This is actually a mistake, because the princes in this story use their powers of deduction to make stunning insightful predictions, it was used by Voltaire in Zadig, and Poe for his Auguste Dupin, and birthed the modern detective fiction genre. Interestingly, Serendip refers to the Arab word for Sri Lanka (Simhala dvipa)The phase-locking experiments on the brain show that people with higher periods of chaotic noisy brain activity have higher IQs, as if intelligence depends on randomly experimenting to seek new neuronal connections. DNA seems to have found the Goldilocks zone, vulnerable to change and errors in copying such that mutations can create new solutions, and yet resistant enough that this doesn’t get out of hand and is able to be passed on across generations with fidelity. Water-fleas are crustaceans that reproduce asexually, 100% female. Except when times are bad, then they suddenly start producing males and reproduce sexually, because hard times call for innovative new solutions. Otherwise asexual reproduction is faster, more efficient, takes less resources, so it should have dominated the mode of reproduction across species.Sexual reproduction also softens the rate of change. For instance, a mutation that allowed DNA to be highly vulnerable to mutation, errors, combined with a stable version of the gene and didn’t swing too wildly in any one direction. The gift that keeps on giving Steven Johnson - Gutenberg’s printing press. This time the fact that it needed established technologies from other fields, like movable type from China, and paper, but combined with Gutenberg’s own expertise in metallurgy to create the press. Similarly, the punch-cards from textiles to computingFeathers were first evolved for warmth, then their property of directing air-flows pushed them in the direction of flight. That’s why down-feathers (warmth) are symmetrical, while flight-feathers are asymmetrical, with different evolutionary trajectories. Cities help sub-cultures thrive by giving them critical mass. This promotes migration of outliers from less densely populated areas towards melting pots of development of fringe ideas. Multitasking gets a bad rap because really what it refers to is serial-tasking, doing one task after the other all within the context of a single overall goal. True multitasking refers to how all the Enlightenment gentlemen scientists operated, with dozens of interests and hobbies that they kept in their minds at the same time and allowed to cross-fertilize. Darwin’s paradox about coral reefs - how are such nutrient-poor regions teeming with life. Two phenomena explain this paradox. 1) Like beavers, coral are ecological engineers that create a platform for entire ecosystems to thrive. 2) these closed-loop systems cycle/utilize energy (from the sun) far more efficiently through symbiosis, waste is perfectly recycled, by algae feeding polyp and using its waste, and polyps sheltering the sponges and using its waste etc. In fact, the latest idea in construction is green-cement that uses coral reef principles to build, and needs CO2 that it uses from industrial waste. Platforms - as opposed to competitive advantage, platforms creative cooperative advantage, where shared resources and pooled ideas/competences create value, like Coffeehouses in UK (publishing, insurance), Freud’s salon, GPS at the APL, and Twitter which in a digital competitive landscape where companies sold product first and then partially opened up API mindful of their IP instead opened up API first and only then launched twitter.com, consequently the @,#, search features all came from users developing apps on the platform. Is this the new idea for government? An open platform that allows citizens to come up with innovative problems of governance?Whence the myth of the genius inventor then? For instance, Carrier who was working on the issue of humidity for publishing industry singlehandedly came up with airconditioner, becoming rich. Is this the norm or the exception?2x2 matrix with individual vs networked innovation on X axis, and Market vs Non-market on Y. As expected, during renaissance we get the lone genius inventor with only 10% being networked ideas. But during 1600-1800, as the printing press makes flow of ideas easier and faster, the majority of innovation is networked. Similarly, in modern times, you’d expect quadrant to be highly market-concentrated, but it’s not. Markets were designed inefficient in one respect: ideas. The costs of barriers and artificial scarcity thanks to patents etc, might be outweighed by benefit of incentivizing innovation. The problem with this view is that open network innovation (Q4) have far outstripped market based innovation, championed by the new institution: the academic research universities. Marx wanted to dedicate Das Kapital 2 to Darwin, who politely declined since he wasn’t familiar enough with it to be seen as an endorser. Marx rightly believed the cut-throat natural selection of Darwin would be compared eventually to market capitalism, but where he thought it would be compared unfavorably as beastly, it instead gained strength, drawing from natural orders. We contrast the competitive force of capitalism vs the cooperative force of socialism, but neither of these come close to the true synthesis achieved by the generative platform of the coral reef. These platforms, like the internet, are not just good ideas but good ideas that make it easier to have other good ideas. Is it possible to have a non-market driven platform generator?"

There was also a bit of blatant self promotion of his other books and side projects--""speaking of good ideas, I had an awesome one and you should go check it out"".

An attempt to abstract the conditions in which innovation thrives, along the way making many analogies to nature (e.g. sex is good for innovation because it brings disparate 'ideas' together and allows for a small amount of error).But there are the seeds of good recommendations here, tied to each of the environmental factors he identifies that encourage innovation:  The adjacent possible: innovation usually (perhaps tautologically in my opinion) in small leaps from current thinking and technology. We don't innovate totally out of nowhere, and ideas may be 'begging' to be discovered, but only can when the world is 'almost there'. Primary evidence is ""the multiple""--simultaneous inventing of things--(e.g. calculus, electric battery, isolation of oxygen)  Liquid networks: having lots of 'spare parts' to tinker with lots of mixing and opportunities for good ideas (or people with good ideas) to come together  The slow hunch: People often have ideas stewing in their heads for a long time, only to be solved or result in practical application when the timing or inspiration is right. It's good to find people who have several diverse interests that are marinating and to find good ways to let slow hunches converge. Infrequent brainstorming sessions aren't effective, he argues, but frequent collaboration between diverse minds can...or even better a mind-mapping semantically aware database that will allow different threads or slow hunches from different people to collide.  Serendipity: Luck certainly plays a role in innovation. Sorry, can't remember at this time how to 'foster' serendipity...  Error: innovation sometimes comes directly out of error (e.g. penicillin), or comes after a series of mistakes errors (webspeak: ""fail faster""), so embrace errors, certainly don't punish them or strive to remove all possible errors.  Exaptation: From Stephen J. Gould in its evolutionary context, the fact that many innovations come from repurposing existing technology to do something totally different (and novel). An example: Gutenberg's printing press is an exaptation of the screw press used in winemaking  Platforms: Build an open platform that others can build on top of and innovation will flourish. Analogy here is the coral reef. Recent innovations on the Web scream this: facebook, twitter, google(maps/mail...). Open platforms that allow innovators to quickly take advantage of what you've built and take it in new directions accelerates innovation incredibly. Cool example was a Washington, D.C. contest for the best app use of government data. Thousands of apps were created to compete for prizes; the apps would've taken orders of magnitude more money (if not time) had the government endeavored to build them itself. This may be a very interesting trend in the near future: innovation within government (but of course, coming from without).  Oh, and I did like the following quotation from the conclusion: ""You may not be able to turn your government into a coral reef, but you can create comparable environments on the scale of everyday life: in the workplaces you inhabit; in the way you consume media; in the way you augment your memory. The patterns are simple, but followed together, they make for a whole that is wiser than the sum of its parts. Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank."""

284,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259627-nathan,0,"I first came across Steven Johnson five or six years ago, via Everything Bad is Good for You. At the time, I was considering switching careers—I wanted to make videogames—so Everything Bad resonated very personally with me. I also loved the straightforward writing and the cross-disciplinary ideas in the book, which led me to read several more of Johnson’s books: The Ghost Map and The Invention of Air. Both of those books lived up to my high expectations, so I have been eagerly awaiting the next Steven Johnson book for some time now.Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation is Johnson’s examination of great ideas—which he broadly defines to include human inventions and natural inventions—how they originate and how we can generate more of them. The book begins with Charles Darwin studying a coral reef. Johnson describes the reef as an engine of innovation. He then goes on to describe two other major engines of innovation: cities and the Web. All three of these examples (and others) recur throughout the book. Johnson then lays out the basic structure of the book: seven patterns govern the invention and adoption of good ideas. The book devotes a single chapter to each of the patterns. Within each chapter, Johnson applies the pattern to all kinds of ideas from the tiny coral polyps up to the global Web.Each of the seven patterns is highlighted by entertaining anecdotes from science or history. These anecdotes are well selected and well told—Johnson is an excellent storyteller—and they do a good job of explaining material that could otherwise be very abstract. I enjoyed the style—jumping from topic to topic—even more than the in-depth look at a single man presented in Ghost Map or Invention of Air. Because Johnson has such a broad base of knowledge, he is at his best when sampling the most interesting bits from a full range of scientific disciplines and historical periods.Each chapter also contains prescriptions for how the chapter’s pattern can be applied to a business, an individual, or a nation. Because of these direct applications, Good Ideas often reads like a cross between a popular science book and a business book. The combination works well, and Good Ideas will likely stimulate its readers to some good ideas of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways to stimulate more good ideas in their business or in their personal life, or to anyone who enjoys tales of invention and entertaining science anecdotes."
285,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/627457-book-calendar,4,"Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation by Steven JohnsonThis book is a history of how good ideas and inventions come into being. It is very scientific and technically oriented focusing on Charles Darwin, James D. Watson, Willis Haviland Carrier, Enrico Fermi, and other people with breakthrough ideas. At the same time, it uses historical examples to extrapolate ways that individuals will likely become more innovative.Some of the ideas behind the book are not intuitive. For example, Tim Berner's Lee development of the world wide web occurred over a long time period without any single eureka moment. Many ideas come from slow continuous development.Steven Johnson describes many ways to increase individual innovation; keep a diary, browse libraries, bookstores, and the internet, have workspaces which mix order and disorder, keep a wide variety of hobbies, and go to places where ideas flow freely like cafes and innovative spaces. The author uses lots of stories and examples to illustrate his points. He even has a timeline of innovation in the appendix of this book. The Notes and Further Reading section cites numerous authors like Clay Shirky, Charles Darwin, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm Gladwell, Edward O. Wilson, and Lawrence Lessig. This book will have an especially strong appeal to people interested in computers and new media.The book is not just about individual ways that people can innovate. It also describes some causes of innovation like serendipity, exaptation, and error. In addition it goes beyond the individual to include examples of environmental factors. For example, cities condense the amount of people freeing people to try new things, and platforms like Twitter increase the ability to communicate new ideas.I found the book to be very well organized. This made it easy to think about what I was reading. In addition to the appendix which had the Chronology of Key Innovations 1400 to 2000 and the Notes and Further Reading, there was a bibliography and index. This is a very well put together book. Amanda Dewey is listed as the designer for the book. If you look on the internet, she has designed quite a few bestsellers"
286,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"An interesting and cheerful book, in which (esp. recent) history seems one great adventure, with clever ideas whizzing by as life just gets better and better. For us living in cities it's also pleasant to read a book about the benefits of living in cities. Cities, after a long period of being excoriated as the example of all that is bad about humanity, seem to be making a comeback in the minds of popular-book writers. This comeback may be fueled in part by the undeniable fact that people in varying societies all over the world are voting with their feet in this regard, and not all of these people can be idiots.I think that some people who read this book will read it in search of a high-class enterprise self-help book, which might be alternately (sub-)titled something like “Make Innovation Happen In Your Life and Work!” If these readers are actually paying attention, and are mathematically literate, they will be disappointed. Why? Because it would be difficult not to notice that (even given that the optimal conditions of urban living, free-wheeling collaboration, open-sourcing, excellent Internet connectivity, etc., are in place) the statistical probability of a creative breakthrough taking place in your presence correspond roughly to the size of the area of the Pacific Ocean which is productive, colorful, life-filled coral reef versus the area of Pacific Ocean which is cold, empty, dead space. Which is to say: the statistical probability is very small even in the best circs. See what I did there? I used a much-invoked metaphor (the ocean and coral reefs) from the book in my evaluation of the book. Damn, I'm clever!In any event, this makes the book something of a cheerful lie, because the space given to successful creative endeavors gives the impression that innovation occurs often enough for many of us to have a reasonable hope of being present at a creation, even while it occasionally reminds us that these successes are far outnumbered by unproductive dead ends. I don't have any good suggestion about how the Johnson could have remedied this, short of authoring a 10,000 book in which 9,750 pages are blank or filled with gibberish.Well, that was a downer, huh? Remedy: Good ahead and read this fun book – you'll feel better."
287,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15580126-andrey,5,"Brilliant book on the theory of where innovation comes from, at the root of which is the principle of the ""Adjacent Possible"". Explained as a ""door that opens the way to more doors"", this concept means that any given innovation opens up even more possibilities for new discoveries. In other words, new ideas are not just randomly born out of nowhere, but are sequential and dependent on the way we combine currently available tools and knowledge. The big question, of course, is how do we effectively make these connections. To answer that, the rest of the book covers the different ways the ""Adjacent Possible"" can be nurtured, whether it be through platforms, ""hunches""/ideas slowly maturing over time, errors, etc.  Among the many devices for innovation presented in this book, one of my favorites was the Commonplace Book (I've been unknowingly keeping one myself, though without a proper index). The author documents its importance in the history of innovation, as many scholars (eg. John Locke) have used it. As with everything else in the book, Commonplace Journal promotes the ""adjacent possible"" and maturation of ""hunches""/ideas over time. "
288,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"I think the author cuts through the crap regarding where inspiration comes from and produces some reasonable trends that explain where a lot of good ideas come from for instance:The adjacent possible - Often many good but almost identical ideas come out at the same time. Innovation usually happens in an area not too different from where the status quo is, so a requisite innovation allows many new ideas to flower which several people may work on at once.The author also gives a compelling, data-based argument on why constrictions on patent use may be counterproductive as he goes through literally thousands of good ideas in the 20th century and isolates how many are market driven vs. not. Fewer and fewer grand ideas are market driven and more come from university research or a knock-on of some other public project which suggests that patents may become counterproductive in spurring innovation.Finally, the book is recent enough to talk about phenomena like social networking and to treat multiple phases of the IT revolution rather than just bits of it."
289,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116112846-david-iba-ez,4,"I found this to be a highly enlightening read. I’ve lately garnered an increased interest and fascination with the history of innovation, and how ideas and creativity are truly spawned. This book, through well cited and researched history and biographical accounts, greatly explores this rather compelling topic While not entirely shocking, from the start it works quickly to abolish the often held, albeit more parochial preconception that groundbreaking ideas stem from moments of heightened enlightenment. The light bulb above the head if you will. This epiphany concept, while perhaps more romantic in a sense, in truth is more fantasy than fiction. More of histories greater innovations are hammered out gradually often over years of trial, obstacles, and failures, eventually born from these efforts via a slow, gradual ignition, or in some cases, even by accident. And when breakthrough ideas are more abruptly made, the contributing thoughts that might have led to them more often occur during the likes of a long walk, and not necessarily in the dedicated confines of a laser focused office or lab environment. Other means of innovation are discussed chapter by chapter, however this seems to be a consistent theme within most of them. This book excels in telling this story with the use of countless well serving examples and metaphors. The use of Charles Darwin’s exploits to open and close this story, while occasionally feeling a bit longwinded, did seem to ultimately fit this narrative well. The nature and existence of ocean reefs is called upon numerous times, as they represent an extensive, interactive network architecture that cultivate an exceedingly highly proportion of life within the oceans. Also applied to these concepts are parallels to the carbon atom, with its unique four valence electrons that thus allow its immense propensity to form the complex, elemental ingredients that would ultimately become for harbinger for life as we know it. During this course of analogous study, it is also posited that there is such a thing as too much order as well as too much chaos to serve as an effective creative medium. A parallel presented on this point is that of a liquid vs. a solid vs. a gas. A solid, with it’s rigid, unyielding appointment of tightly bonded atoms, gives little to influences from its external environment. A gas on the other hand, remains in a constant state of flux and dispersion, never able to really come together for any concentrated purpose. A liquid however, can be contained and connected, while remaining fluid and adaptive to its constantly changing environment. This analogy is used effectively when describing what some have discovered to be uniquely productive working environments, as modeled by powerhouse creative forces such as Microsoft and MIT. Another relevant example presented is that of a comparison of the entrepreneurial developments of corporations like YouTube and Google contrasted with that of the FBI. The open, serendipitous, highly interactive environments of these Silicon Valley companies led to what the author portrays as a far faster and more efficient result than that of the more singularly focused and siloed FBI. This isolation allegedly did not cultivate an environment of efficient knowledge sharing and, just as importantly, knowledge benchmarking, thus stagnating important key insights such as findings that could have possibly prevented the 9/11 attacks. All these concepts in one way or another contribute to what the author refers to as the “adjacent possible”, which is really the heart and soul of this book’s revelation. Ideas, ecosystems, and the formation of life itself have all relied on this concept to reach their achievements. More pathways, more interactions, more doors. This message is further supported with other well serving case studies such as that of Tim Berners-Lee and his path to the creation of what would become the world wide web, Johannes Gutenberg tailoring the concept of a grape screw press to fashion the world’s first printing press, and many others.For those hoping to increase their creativity, this book in turn may also be quite the endorsement to pack up and move back to the city, where that density of experiences and interactions lead to an increase in this adjacent possible. The best serving example of this as illustrated is the Italian Renaissance. This is considered one of the greatest surges in cultural and technological growth in history, with the primary catalyst for this being the dramatic increases in more localized, urban developments of that time. This led to Italy having struck just the right balance of order, chaos, and thought density, i.e. interacting population, to have enjoyed an era of highly disproportional innovation. Living amidst the crowded streets of Florence or Rome granted one with simply “more doors” to explore. Through these many histories and examples, the author paints a vivid picture of what he believes his findings conclude as the most effective creative forces and environments. Upon completion, one may likely be compelled to dismiss the cartoonish visual of that light bulb above the head, and instead favor more the idea of networks, or more visually, rooms with doors, as the more dominant metaphor in this story. I will point out that the narrative does take a bit of an odd and unexpected turn in its latter pages as it devotes much of its closure to the debate on the merits of patents and intellectual property, while also working to categorize many of histories more notable innovations based on whether they were hatched from either a more singular or networked origin, and whether they were more economically or socially capitalized on. While some compelling points are made, for myself the heart of this book resided within it’s earlier chapters which seek to explore the historically demonstrated nature of creativity, and which I feel did this very well.

Every year the Website Edge poses a question to thinkers in a variety of fields. The 2011 question submitted by Steven Pinker with some input from Daniel Kahneman is “What scientific concept would improve everybody’s cognitive toolkits?” See http://edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html , to see the responses. And if you are interested in acquiring scientific concepts to improve your thinking, read Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From. It’s full of thought models like the adjacent possible, liquid networks and the slow hunch that have relevance for any real life circumstance or academic discipline. I read this first as a borrowed e-book from my library but some of the graphics were hard to see. I’ve since purchased the hardbound version because the ideas that it presents are one I know I’ll want to come back to."
291,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43439866-leilani,5,"I agree with the basic premise, being an academic myself (in computer science, no less), and having studied many of the same tech examples mentioned in this book. My own PhD advisor said himself that his ideas never came from isolation, they came from going out into the world and talking to other people! This book has crystalized some ideas that I had only a vague sense of before. Given a clear definition, I can now act on these ideas directly in my own life, and I look forward to seeing the results in the future. Write everything downUPDATE 10/19/2019: Read this book again. Gave me good ideas for my research lab. Weekly meetings are are important! Write everything down. Get exposed to lots of other ideas. Try to find tangential or unorthodox connections between information. Make sure your ideas get out there so people can help improve them. I already do these things, but good to teach to students!"
292,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Nice conversational read. I added this in my trek through books on innovation and I'm glad I did. Johnson packaged his points very well. He presents that not just good ideas, but evolutionary changes arise from things like the ""adjacent possible"" - where at any moment many different, but only certain things are possible; where serendipity and error generate those ""good ideas""; where exaptation, liquid networks, ""slow hunches"" and specific platforms germinate and nurture the ideas which we take for granted today. Very little is truly never-been-thought-of-before, flash-like innovation, but the processes of the creation of ideas are the innovation of which Johnson writes. My one beef is the lack of in-text cites...I dislike the form of endnotes without direct references as I read.Recommended."
293,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1218525-estella,5,"Whether you're into politics, history, biographies, inventing, or otherwise being creative, this book is a must-read. Johnson's methods of research and writing are brilliantly approaching a comprehensive look into innovation, starting with the building blocks of life, and journeying through coral reefs, metropolitan communities, and cyberspace. Johnson aims to inspire us to live our lives in a way that will maximize our ability to find creative solutions, and ideally, effect change in the way our government functions and finds its own creative solutions.Personally, I wish I was at university again, or at least a book club, so I could share this with my students and consequently have amazing discussions!"
294,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,3,"This book contains a handful of mildly interesting/useful concepts for people seeking to boost creativity at work or at play. It's inspired me to dabble, mingle, and explore more -- as a scholar, teacher, advocate, writer, and resident of my neighborhood.Johnson's style is readable, though not exceptionally pithy or eloquent. Evidence invoked to support his argument consists of nature metaphors and historical anecdotes -- he offers interesting connections and analyses, but nothing outside the box or earth-shattering. And, it occurs to me now, most of his innovator examples are male. Not offended by this... just observing.In sum, I recommend watching Johnson's TED talk -- and/or, better yet, the RSAnimate rendition of this book."
295,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898018-jonathan,3,"This book started well but the premise began to feel a little slight as the book progressed. I did enjoy it, perhaps I have read too many similar books recently and I certainly agree with the premise that good ideas come from an evolutionary hubbub of ideas interacting in dense competitive settings. The section about the notebooks kept by the great thinkers of the enlightenment was very interesting, basically they kept notes of everything they read and thus created a kind of personal mind map of all that they read in their own words. It made me realize how important it is to try to summaries your thoughts about a book, however briefly, in a forum such as this."
296,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2966570-frank-kelly,3,"I recently heard Johnson speak at a conference in Chicago on this topic in the context of the growth of cities. An excellent and quite humorous speaker. His book read much like a long and insightful essay, populated with a series of fascinating insights on a host of innovations and inventions -- some that have radically changed how we live and others that, well, have not but are interesting nontheless. It is hard to categorize this book -- not really a business book, certaintly not a management book. Rather, it is what it says it is: A concise history of innovation. "
297,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/205109-evelyn-smith,5,"A very, very interesting read. And topical since our political and social environment is stressing innovation and entrepreneurship (not the same thing, however!) as the key to economic regain. My one critique is that the author focused very heavily on the development of scientific innovations. What about social ones? How does social innovation distinguish itself or relate to some of processes behind the technological advances Johnson describes? With this in mind, I feel like there is a missing chapter or two...."
298,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5599078-gayatri-sriram,5,"A brilliant look at ideas and innovation that have changed the game. Johnson uses case studies that we all know and admire but relays an enchanting account of where they came from. By comparing our workplace/city/ or any place that requires ideation to a coral reef, he establishes the ideal environment for churning out million dollar ideas; open liquid networks. The key steps that go into producing that one good idea have been looked at, I do sincerely now believe that the 'eureka moment' is a highly rare event erroneously broadcast as a more common occurrence."
299,1594487715,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5103605-kristen,4,"This was a great look at how many of the innovations in the past few centuries have come about from both a historical and a sociological perspective. It also provides some food for thought on ways you might adopt certain strategies for creative thinking. My favorite was the ""commonplace book,"" which I have now adopted to record favorite quotes or thoughts from my reading. Definitely worth a read if you're interested in innovative thinking."
