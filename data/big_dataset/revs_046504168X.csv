0,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285038-rebecca,2,"I read The Revenge of Gaia in order to understand Lovelock's analysis of climate change and what's in store for our future, and for that I am not sorry I read it. I found the middle section of the book, the part on climate, compelling and informative. So it gets two stars. There is SOMEthing of value in these pages.But his *sociology* got my blood boiling. I was absolutely seething, and ready to tear my hair out. I felt very strong hate and disgust for some of his uninformed claims, for his formulaic regurgitation of our society's most dangerous myths of cultural hegemony.In one of the most distressing passages, he blames globalized society's inability to take decisive action to care for the environment on... get this .... our ""tribal natures."" But indigenous tribes have NOTHING to do with industrial pollution in the first place. Globalized society cannot act in cohesion and come to a consensus decision on the environment because it is NOT locally grounded and tribally organized---not the other way around! Tribal people are intelligent, resourceful, sensitive, vivacious, and creative, and they have strong social cohesion.... and you can trace the roots of every human being alive today to a tribal social organization, roots which extend back in time for about a million years. I read Lovelock's dismissal of our genetic/social inheritance as an easy (not to mention racist) shot at ""uncivilized"" people who are marginalized in political discourse, who have no means or support for getting up to the proverbial podium to defend themselves.Indigenous tribes did not make the Earth sick. Civilization Did.Furthermore, Lovelock himself can't seem to make up his mind whether he loves or hates civilization. He blames it for its vicious cycle of wholesale destruction on one page, and on the next page he preaches that we must save it by all means possible because ""it is the greatest asset we bring to the Earth."" In some chapters he sounds downright schizophrenic.Examples of passages that were met with nothing but disgust, astonishment, and concerned perplexity on my end:p. 4... ""I think that we reject the evidence that our world is changing because we are still, as that wonderfully wise biologist E. O. Wilson reminded us, tribal carnivores. We are programmed by our inheritance to see other living things as mainly something to eat...""But Professor Lovelock, I don't see any ""tribal carnivores"" caging up animals on farms, feeding them s**t, cutting off their beaks so they can't peck each other to death in prison, changing their genetic makeup, processing their bodies in slaughterhouses while they're not yet dead, and dumping their waste into rivers. In fact, I know of more than one tribe of people who revere the animals that they eat, who are endlessly thankful for their bodies as gifts, and who create special places in their mythological pantheons to the spirits of those animals.No, we are not programmed by genetic inheritance to be selfish and sadistic. Rather, we are programmed by American Idol to turn a blind eye to our misdeeds. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. That's what you get when you have a complex society worshipping endless growth coupled with that handy lubricant to ""progress"" called economic specialization.p. 9... ""Terrorism and genocide both result from our tribal natures. Tribal behaviour is surely written in the language of our genetic code, or why else would we as a mob or a crowd do the evil things that only psychopaths would do alone. ... Civilzation has only slightly sanitized these awful trends and called them war.""Lovelock misses the news that tribes are NOT ""mobs"" or ""crowds."" They are FAMILIES and COMMUNITIES. Not a mob of strangers. And civilization did not ""sanitize"" genocide, terrorism and war, it created them. (This is not to say that tribal people are never violent. Of course they are. Violence has its place in nature. However, there is a marked difference between a singular act of violence and a systemic flaw in social structure that allows for destruction on a pathological scale.)p. 10... ""in some ways the human species is like a planetary disease""...Just civilized society--leave indigenous groups out of it!!...""but through civilization we redeem ourselves and have become a precious asset for the Earth.""(Right, because I've never heard of indigenous people taking the opportunity to learn about the ecosystem they are a part of, and deliberately helping it to flourish. Oh wait, yes I have. But I've never heard of a civilized institution doing that. Hmm.)Not only that, but if we ""redeem ourselves"" through civilization (as though humans are born bad... is it really scientific to believe in original sin?), well then... why do you write the following?:p. 6 ""We as a civilization are all too much like someone addicted to a drug""andp. 8 ""We need most of all to renew that love and empathy for nature that we lost when we first began our love affair for city life""andp. 7 ""We are so obsessed with the idea of progress and with the betterment of humanity that we regard retreat as a dirty word, something to be ashamed of. The philosopher and historian of ideas John Gray observed in his book Straw Dogs that only rarely do we see beyond the needs of humanity, and he linked this blindness to our Christian and humanist infrastructure. It arose 2000 years ago and was then benign, and we were no significant threat to Gaia. Now that we are over six billion hungry and greedy individuals, all aspiring to a first-world lifestyle, our urban way of life encroaches upon the domain of the living Earth. We are taking so much that it is no longer able to sustain the familiar and comfortable world we have taken for granted.""Christian and humanist infrastructure made civilization what it is. So how does civilization redeem us, if its very infrastructure may be our own demise?We are in a state of dependency on civilization, kept infantilized, and no matter how fickle and merciless it is, we must profess to love that which we are dependent upon, or face the insanity of cognitive dissonance.p. 134 ""Whatever form future society takes it will be tribal, and hence there will be the privileged and the poor.""Right, because tribal groups all use currency, think of the land as property, and have hierarchical structures.--------I can't believe a *scientist* would not do his research before making such claims. To my mind, it is VERY clear that Lovelock is perpetuating the kind of propaganda that rationalized literal and cultural genocide, as well as ecocide, in the Western Hemisphere and the continent of Africa in the 18th/19th centuries. Does this represent ""progress""? Is this an ""enlightened"" scientific viewpoint? The ""age of enlightenment"" resulted in exploitation, reductionism, industrial pollution, phrenology (the scientific validation of racial superiority), live vivisection (even on dogs), ""objective"" (static and rigid) classification (often hierarchical), and vast other examples of numb cruelty (e.g., purposefully driving chimpanzees insane) in the name of science and of commercial gain. This insane, disassociated, demented behavior was rationalized by intellectual proponents who believed that they had (or could find out) ""all the answers."" To that I can only respond - Stupid is as Stupid does. Judging from these historical roots, modern science looks more and more like an organized religion, albeit one without spirituality, and its superstition is that humans have the brain-given right to do whatever dumb, callous s**t they want as long as they can't foresee how it could harm *them* in any way. In other words, science's founding superstition is not that there is a god in the sky, but rather, that humans can be all-knowing, all-controlling gods on Earth. If they are not, they are not ""living up to their potential"" and are ""savage animals."" Lovelock himself writes on p. 137, ""When I was a child I was marinated in Christian belief, and still it unconsciously guides my thinking and behavior."" No S**t.Actually, I recant the first sentence of the preceding paragraph.Tangents aside, I have one further point of criticism: Lovelock's solutions are Euro-centric and require economic investments which ""developing"" nations simply can't muster.Lovelock's ""prescription"" for what we ""should"" do is authoritarian in the worst degree. His anthropology/sociology is amateur at its very best. One of the dangers of professional science in general is that it claims to have all the answers. It doesn't."
1,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"An interesting book with some scary and memorable passages. Lovelock invented the Gaia hypothesis (the idea that the whole biosphere is essentially one living organism). Here, he's addressing the problems of climate change, and what we can do about it. ""I'm a doctor,"" he says. ""The Earth is my patient, and it's running a temperature."" Lovelock used to be against nuclear power, but now he thinks it's our only chance. We have to bring down CO2 emissions fast, and we can't quickly wean ourselves off our energy dependence. This was another analogy I liked. We're in a 747 over the Atlantic, and we're running out of fuel. We somehow need to find enough to make a powered descent. If we just turn off the engines, we'll crash, and everyone will die.So, nuclear power. But isn't that horribly dangerous? How will we look after all that deadly radioactive waste? The Greens have been asking these questions for two or three decades. Now, confusingly, I read that radioactivity isn't so bad for you after all. We were told that Chernobyl caused thousands of deaths. But, at least according to Lovelock in this book, that was damned lies and statistics. Apart from a few brave engineers and fire-fighters who were killed sealing up the reactor, it's just a miniscule reduction in life expectancy, averaging a few hours per person, but multiplied by most of Europe. That comes out as thousands of person-lifetimes, but who really minds giving up three hours of their life? And we hear that the area around Chernobyl, which I'd pictured as a kind of radioactive desert filled with mutant lizards and road warriors, is a lush, green paradise. People don't dare go there, so plants and animals can flourish undisturbed. Another story he tells is the massive accidental release of radioactivity from Windscale in the UK. There was no following spike in cancers.Well, it sounds plausible, but then so did the last version. The US is once again being managed by a smart person who believes in science and actually looking at the facts. It would be great if Obama could put together a balanced commission of suitably chosen experts who were required to report quickly, weighing up the competing views and rating the arguments for and against. As a layman, I read a book like this and feel seriously confused. All our lives could depend on making the right decisions over the next ten years, and we still don't know what's going on. Now that's scary.______________________________Luckily, the guy on the next street was thinking the same thing, and actually did something about it. David MacKay's 
Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air
 presents exactly the kind of quantitative analysis that I was looking for. I can't recommend this book too highly."
2,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5739335-claudia,1,"I was greatly anticipating this book. Back in Southern California growing up in the 1970's, I heard about the Theory or Concept of Gaia and it appealed to my nascent earth based philosophy. The Gaia Concept postulates that the Earth is a living organism with interdependent systems. Picture if you will, the atmosphere as Her lungs, the oceans as her circulatory system and you get the idea. This idea neatly dove tailed with my personal philosophy (still intact) that everything and everyone is related. The activities of nasty greedy humans with tunnel vision in gun-ho pursuit of short term profits have thrown all of this out of balance (all too true). We pack on her back a city the size of Pittsburgh every year seemingly without being aware that there is simply not enough food or materials to support a burgeoning population of this magnitude. Empowered by the Christian concept that we are stewards of the planet and it is our God given right to have dominion over the plants, and animals, the Earth has become a possession, ours to own and sell, mine, pollute and blast the tops off of mountains to get at deep coal. I never believed this and never believed in the private ownership of land. And, no I am not a Communist, the government shouldn't own the land, no one should. It is presumptuous in the extreme to think that man can presume to OWN a piece of the planet. We were born on the Earth and have a right to live on the Earth, but not to pollute and ruin the air, the oceans and the rivers and streams. Naturally, believing as I do, or did--I am just not sure anymore...I was looking forward, savoring reading the words of who I had perceived as an intellectual kindred soul. Instead, I found the ravings of a madman--psychotic at best, or worse--sociopathic. The book is chauvinistically Anglo-centric. Right away claxons sounded in my mind. He crows that his ""Queen"" opened the first nuclear power plant in the 1950's. How quaint. He then proceeds to divulge that there was a rather large radiation leak, but no worries, no cancer! This leak was kept secret and never told, until, presumably, now. Of course it would be difficult to perform retro-research after so many years to see if any bizarre cancers clustered downwind from the leak. But he assures us that there were none. Ok...The way I see it is that tribal thinking, short term greed, and fanatical patriotism put blinders on us and enhanced our tunnel vision. As long as MY TRIBE gets what it needs, gets the good stuff, has the best weapons arsenal, gets to the moon first and has AAA credit rating and we are a First World Nation, then if our acid rain or choking miasmas float over your village, too bad! And it is not just the USA with this world view. Every industrial country operates this way, starting with England's Colonialism and Industrial Revolution, and continuing on to this day with China. He lost me by page 97 and I started howling shortly after that. He debunks Rachel Carson and her seminal book (""The Silent Spring"") on the adverse effect of DDT on bird eggs. He lamented the cessation of use of DDT on a limited basis as it was so ""useful"". Sure there is collateral damage to bird eggs, but not enough for Rachel Carson to write about. Ok...And I guess, today, it is ok that some bees are dying off? Lovelock advocates that the only way to save our planet is to generate electricity by nuclear power. What? Does he mean nuclear power plants built by the lowest bidder? Where to build them? Along the San Andreas Fault? Near shorelines where Tsunamis can strike? And where are we to dispose of nuclear waste? What about Three Mile Island and Chernobyl? Not that bad, he says. Ok...He justifies that low level radiation, the equivalent of Europe receiving x-rays only decreases our life span by a few days at best and aren't European Nations wondering how to pay pensions to ""ancient citizens"" anyway?He bristled that his beloved England was censored by the Nordic Nations over acid rain falling on their land in the 1970's, but then goes on a bizarre tangent and says that acid rain clouds stagnantly hovering over European cities is a good thing because the presence of these clouds cools the earth. Lovelock wants to recreate the disastrous Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the Philippine Islands in 1991. (I personally saw some of the displaced, the refugees, did you Mr. Lovelock?--Apparently not). He advocates requiring airliners to release sulphur as they fly to decrease global warming. (The atmosphere of Venus, anyone?). He finally states that as Gaia nears her end of being able to support the creatures (and yes, his compassion justifies my use of this term), that we synthesize our food. (Soylent Green, anyone?). Sure we will be tribal and the elite will eat real meat cooked with sauces, but hey, what the heck... right? In a bizarre atavistic conclusion to save his beloved England (which he thinks can survive the coming cataclysm) he advocates once again, dividing 'All of Gaul into Three Parts': 1. cities, roads and airports, 2. Farmland 3. Gaia Space--off limits to humans. I agree that the earth is reaching a point where it cannot sustain life as we know it any longer. But I think that humans . My compassion and humanism is too strong to be able to swallow his notion of shunting aside humans to save the earth at all costs. He is completely devoid of compassion and thinks nothing of saving the earth, at the expense of humans. Have we reached the point of no return? Judging by the political rhetoric coming from world leaders, the pessimist in me says absolutely; the romantic, naive Southern California 1970's beach chick surely hopes not. But what is a given is that our climate is changing, the earth is ailing and cannot continue to support the machinations of corporate greed, rampant consumerism, and untrammeled pollution, rape and pillage. We are all in this together, everyone and everything is related. The earth is not ours to own and exploit, it never was. But what to do, hopefully before it is too late? Nuclear power--is this REALLY OUR BEST solution? Beam me up Scotty....Or give me a Yurt to plunk down somewhere in the Arctic, the only place that may be able to support human life in the near future. "
3,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889315-christy,3,"If consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, then Lovelock is surely a giant here. A true visionary and a wonderful writer with the ability both to analyze data and convey scientific understandings metaphorically to the lay reader, he sadly seems to have become the 21st century schizoid man through his love for two wholly incompatible entities: Gaia, the living planet he first (in modern times) identified as such, and British ""civilization"" which has been one of the forces most destructive of the whole relationship to Gaia he sees as essential to human survival. So to keep the lovely British countryside free of ugly, awful wind farms, and still give Brits the power I guess to listen to Purcell concerts and read books on tape? he advocates--nuclear reactors? Leaving aside the bomb and waste threats (which he utterly dismisses) whose farm are they going to beautify? He talks about cellphones and the internet being good things because they keep us from getting on planes and in cars, in the absence of any evidence to this effect, and the presence of much evidence that they further disconnect us from any sense of ourselves as part of the natural world. Oh, and the third world has somehow unfairly been denied the DDT that's what Africa really needs to develop, by elitist liberals in the north. His presentation of the science behind global heating and his knowledge of how Earth's ecosystems function are solid and compelling. But his fundamental flaw is in not seeing that it's not British civilization he ought to be trying to preserve at all costs but the lifeways of millions of people who actually have a knowledge and understanding of Gaia that extends back far before Lovelock and William Golding took their now-famous walk through that English village. The rest of us in the global north, including Lovelock, ought to be learning from their example. Then maybe we could produce the knowledge-book he advocates (one of his only good suggestions in my view) as a kind of farmer's almanac for the future, that could help every household reacquire at least some of the basic skills of how to live with instead of against nature."
4,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,3,"There was a lot about this which made a lot of sense - Lovelock's discussions of energy generation (esp. with regards nuclear power and the flaws of several 'renewable' sources) and pollution was interesting and intelligent, and the author writes engagingly without oversimplifying. I would recommend much of this message to be read by a great many folks too ignorant of the impact of human activity on our planet.I was however rather less enamoured by the central 'Gaia' hypothesis, and by a number of other slightly nonsensical analogies used by an author - to me these simplifications added little and in fact raised numerous questions which weakened his generally reasonable points. The conflict between writing such a 'human-centric' (and oft 'Britain-centric') book warning against our current lifestyles leading to the collapse of our ecosystem(s), and the definition of Gaia in slightly anthropomorphic terms as 'a self-governing Earth, and all the chemical, physical and biological processes within it, including human life' was troublesome for me. I understand our actions will probably have significant impact on ourselves, other organisms and the planet, it just seems a bit strange to disconnect this from a basic, fatalist Darwinism where mass extinctions wouldn't lead to a feedback 'solving' many problems - or even where a future Earth robbed of human life would 'necessarily' be a bad thing. Lovelock's warning that we must change to survive is very real, but I can't help thinking there is a lot in the future unanticipated in this book."
5,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"The Revenge of Gaia is really not all that different from Lovelock’s later book The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning. In both, he warns about a coming climate catastrophe that he believes will be sudden and devastating to life on earth (particularly to humans after civilization collapses).With regards to climate change, Lovelock is pretty pessimistic to say the least. He expects melting glaciers to have a devastating effect on the planet by the end of this century. By way of evidence he points in particular to the way that feedback loops can have a multiplicative effect on temperatures. White ice reflects sunlight back into space, as it melts, more dark land and water are exposed increasing light absorption. Life in the ocean cannot survive above certain temperatures, as the surface of the ocean warms, algae, which converts CO2 into O2 will die, causing CO2 emissions to increase. As permafrost melts, trapped methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) will be released. And depressingly … there are more, many of which are poorly understood.While Lovelock’s assessment of the mechanisms of global warming are in line with that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the severity and timeline of his predictions go beyond scientist’s current best understanding. With a complex system in which so many variables are unknown, predictions can prove to be inaccurate. With that said, given that global warming is a fact and is expected to have a tremendous negative impact on the planet under most scenarios, his warnings are not without warrant. And if much of the world's land becomes uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming by 2050, Lovelock will look like a wise sage who was foolishly unheeded. It’s a shame, therefore, that the roving bands of hunter/gatherers that constitute the remains of our civilization will be unlikely, and unable to erect a statue.The book also goes into some detail regarding Lovelock’s theory of Gaia, which proposes that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are closely integrated to form a single and self-regulating complex system, maintaining the conditions for life on the planet. The hypothesis is really a metaphor, and sometimes metaphors can offer new ways of thinking about a problem that lend insight (Richard Dawkins “selfish gene” is one such example). While I think the idea is intriguing, I’m unconvinced that the Earth as Gaia idea is a particularly accurate, or useful concept. The body provides homeostasis because it is an interrelated agglomeration of cells, each of which carries identical DNA and is controlled by a central nervous system. The Earth simply does not behave in this fashion, and certainly did not evolve the same way our bodies did. It’s possible the idea is a useful one, but I remain unconvinced.Finally, a review would be incomplete without acknowledging the fact that Lovelock is a rather idiosyncratic person. He poo-poos wind and solar energy, yet is a big proponent of nuclear fusion. Yes … fusion, the same energy that powers the sun! While fusion does indeed produce energy, the state of the technology at present is completely unproven and faces huge engineering hurdles that have yet to be resolved. Compare this with wind and solar, two energy forms that are already used in wide practice. Another example of Lovelock’s eccentric thinking can be found his idea to dispose of nuclear waste by spreading it throughout natural areas (he specifically mentions the Amazon) as a radioactive barrier to keep people out. While this actually might work, perhaps it’s a bit heavy handed (or completely freaking insane)?After two books, my impression of Lovelock is that he’s a smart guy with ideas that range the gamut from good to completely off the wall, and he’s completely convinced every single one of them is absolutely right."
6,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75572550-daniel,2,"A useful introduction to the various environmental problems threatening the planet, I'm not sure I have much of a leg to stand on in criticising Lovelock's science - which seems rigorous and well-explained, although I did notice a slightly mischievous manipulation of life-expectancy statistics.Still, it's Lovelock's science - or, rather, his scientism - which really holds the book back. The whole thing is riddled with transhistorical, typically biological, assumptions about the world - a lot of quite basic evo-psych, some quite reactionary statements about sex (and a truly baffling number of inappropriate comments on race), and above all a totally uncritical notion of 'nature' for which (brace yourselves) the immediate remedy would be to read some fucking Raymond Williams.Lovelock is caught between an unreflective scientism - a powerful optimism in the possibilities of technological change, a faith in (at least some) expertise, a detached seriousness about the value of human life - and a very conservative sentimentality about rural/wild/natural aesthetics and respect for 'civilisation'. For every comment about cancer being blown out of proportion and the importance of Gaia trumping human interests, there is a comment about how important it is to protect Gaia for humans and the dangers that climate change (or banning DDT) poses to human life. Caught between technological utopianism (nuclear fusion, gigantic airships, synthesised food and a man-made ocean mist) and gloomy apocalypticism (deep ecology, every-cure-will-kill-us-and-especially-wind-farms), a cynic might suggest that Lovelock took the easy way out in the 1980s and started being paid by nuclear power companies and Big Aerosol. For what it's worth, I don't think that was the case - but he is deeply marked by the company he keeps (mostly high-profile scientists, many of them working for companies, and the NIMBYs he encounters in his beleaguered south-west) and the tension he articulates is a real storm within him. A lot of his controversial defences (of nuclear power, or pesticides, or aerosols) probably carry some weight, but his total refusal to consider the cost of nuclear fission (having waxed lyrical about the impracticality of solar) is not a point in favour of his blessed scientific objectivity. And the inconsistencies this provokes can be jarring - pages after recognising that densely populated cities are much friendlier to Gaia than suburban sprawl (and surely for that matter, rural sprawl), Lovelock starts to denounce city-dwellers and all they represent for being out-of-touch with 'nature'. But how much more in touch with 'nature' is he, sat amongst line after line of man-made hedgerows, than those in urban areas who are but a short walk from parks which do include approximately 'wild' spaces? Worth noting, to be fair, is the book's publication date (2006), which probably influences Lovelock's optimism about nuclear power and scepticism about renewables - although it doesn't really excuse them.Of course, whether in his optimistic or cynical stance, Lovelock's vision remains confined to science and technology. Engagement with the masses is limited to an educational exercise (admittedly quite an ambitious one - writing a Bible-cum-Encyclopaedia, in a single volume!) and the possibility of societal change is foreclosed. As Lovelock argues, ""Whatever form future society takes it will be tribal, and hence there will be the privileged and the poor"". It is worth quoting at length Lovelock's description of the place of electricity in contemporary society:""Electric power is extraordinary in the way it insinuates itself dendritically throughout society. The wires that carry it extend to every home like nerves in our bodies. It is always there at a wonderfully constant level, yet hardly anyone of the millions who work in the industry worldwide has more than the vaguest notion of what it is or how it is made and regulated. We are just like the termites who, without thought, build their spacious air-conditioned skyscraper communities. The electricity system exists as a communal, but almost wholly unconscious, activity. No wonder we took it for granted; at least we did until it stopped.""How close is this to a description of capital, and of the capitalist system?! But instead, any possibility of socialist change - or any change at all, for environmental problems are genetic and technological rather than societal - is totally avoided. Truly, it is easier to imagine a return to sail than the end of capitalism.Focused on technology, but never wholly convinced that it will save us, Lovelock lurches between gross inhumanity and romantic surrender. With few options to reconcile his two halves, Lovelock reaches for the solution seemingly beloved by every prominent biologist of a certain age - controls on population growth. Though himself acknowledging that population growth isn't the sole or even main cause of environmental change, that the problem isn't how many people there are but how they live, and that at the present moment there is tremendous inequality in what those lives look like - without anywhere else to turn (perhaps a turn to socialism would upset the Goldsmiths and Lovelock's neighbours), he joins Attenborough and others in calling for population to be limited, in Lovelock's case to between a billion and half a billion people. The choice could not be clearer - not just socialism or barbarism, but socialism or barbarisms of two types. The barbarism of human extinction and planetary ruin, or the 'barbarism' of Lovelock's vision: the rule of the scientists and experts, the crushing of democracy, and the elimination of all but the few."
7,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6232519-andy-gibb,2,"Oh dear. James Lovelock is largely rehashing what he's said before but a couple of disturbing aspects of his thinking also come to light. One: in terms of energy, civilisation must continue business as usual, hence his support of nuclear power. Two, and what made me stop at his take on DDT: humans still take precedence over all other creatures. So DDT is good and sod all the birds who die or can't breed because of it.This book seems to be all over the place too, with no central narrative thrust. Unless that be the author's continual return to his defence of nuclear. OK, James, we get it. It could be safer than any other source but it ain't going to happen. The industry's continual own goals ensure that.Amongst the rehashing I gleaned one new piece of information: life on the planet has seen higher CO2 concentrations and survived. I did know that: indeed, around 20 times higher at the start of the Phanaerozoic, i.e. about the start of animal life. But the Sun was weaker back then and the planet probably needed it. Not so now, nor into the future.Lovelock's parting thought is: “to write a guidebook for our survivors to help them rebuild civilisation without repeating too many of our mistakes.” Trouble is: the guidebook already exists; it's in our archaeological record. Decoding that has revealed the errors of previous failed civilisations, which we are repeating now. So, no-one's going to read such a book. And The Revenge of Gaia ain’t it either."
8,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1705884-richard,4,"Lovelock brings Gaia theory up to date by explaining the positive feedback mechanisms that have led us into a runaway greenhouse effect. Best if you have some rudimentary familiarity with science, and earth science in particular -- but not necessary. Lovelock explains how the models work -- and concludes that it's likely too late to avoid the coming heat age. Gaia -- the effectively self-regulating quasi-organism/system that stretches from where the lithosphere meets the mantle to the very fringe of space, and includes volcanic gases, rock, oceans, biota, and the atmosphere -- will have her way with us. Still, he says, we must try. He's not down with the hippie stuff at this point. He thinks we need to go nuclear, because it (fission, for now, and soon, he says, fusion) is the only energy source capable of meeting humanity's needs while we wind down our 6 billion population to something the earth's resources can carry, and switch then to renewables like solar and wind. A note: He doesn't want windmills on the ridge near his cottage in the English countryside -- but he doesn't mind storing all the world's spent nuclear waste (a 16 meter cube each year versus a mountain twelve miles around and a mile high for all the CO2 we'd have to ""sequester"" in a carbon sequestration system for our current energy sources) in a concrete bunker in his backyard. Brilliant man. He suggests those who can move to the arctic and restart civilization from scratch while the billions who don't make it fight it out. The scariest part is, he's no crank. "
9,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175164-andrew,4,"Wasn't always easy to pin down where Lovelock was going. Is his Gaia theory meant to be a strong metaphor? Does he really believe the Earth is truly 'living?' Has civilization reached a tipping point for society as we know it with environmental damage? Or is there a way out yet?I think the reason he may have kept such questions and more ambiguous is because he is quite convinced that there is a crisis related to how humanity has acted to impact Earth/Gaia, and that urgency to act doesn't leave room for feel-good half-efforts. Towards the end I felt the message became a little more clearer. This is not new age-y eco-mystical trash, nor is it afraid to introduce controversial ideas back to the green movement (e.g., nuclear energy.) I appreciated this book a lot because Lovelock and I seem to share a lot of the same criticisms-from-within about ecology and its movements."

The first part desribes planetary homeostasis, how the earth is (or rather, was) a self-regulating system. He shows how this self-regulation *was* achieved through interactions between lifeforms and the physical environment. In doing so, Lovelock (who is now 101 years old), also describes the positive feedbacks loops we approach that could hasten the climate disaster. 5/5 stars. The second part is a defense of Nuclear energy. Given this book was published in 2005, some of the technological capacities and costs of climate friendly energy options are very out of date (especially solar). However, we should have acted then, and had we acted then, he is absolutely right that Nuclear would have the best option for the provision of the baseline electricity our society thrives on. Today, without good batteries, Nuclear energy still has a role to play, especially in countries without the mountainous regions required to 'store' hydroelectric energy and thus provide said baseline power. 4/5 in 2005, 3/5 today. The third and final part is a critique of romantic environmentalism, with it's absolutes, and approaches that ultimately damage the environment or human civilisaiton (see large scale biofuels). In it's place he pleas for the clear communication of scientific information, trust in science, and action. 3/5 stars. These pleas could still be made today. We must act."

In the end, the book made me more mad about the idiosyncrasies and hypocrisies of the author than about climate change and the inevitable destruction of our planet. Also, f*** his views on DDTs."
12,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50949888-eleri,4,"Fascinating. A lot of perspectives and ideas that were new to me, go against the prevailing environmentalist viewpoint, or that I disagree with. Gave me lots to think about"
13,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678485-kristen,4,"Two things I learned from this book: 1) the #1 cause of cancer is Oxygen, a person has a 30% chance of dying from cancer before they reach the expected life span of 70 years, and the only things that enhance the risk are smoking and multiple sun burns, but otherwise, we all have the same chance just from breathing; 2) using wind power, a top contender amongst environmentalists as a renewable energy source, could be more destructive to the Earth than we think.I liked this book, and I like Lovelock's ideas. The theory of Gaia is that the Earth is a living, self-regulating system. This book warns that if we don't take care of Gaia, especially as she is aging and weakening, Gaia will ""self-regulate"" humans into extinction to save itself. Lovelock doesn't hold back in suggesting drastic actions which are hard or me to accept, such as the mass manufacturing of a ""fake"" food in factories to keep our bodies functioning without the need to use up the land for farming and cattle (personally, I like my ""real"" food, and I'm sure most of us do), and in situations like this he doesn't suggest ways to ""please"" the people, but then again his focus is not on people, it's on the Earth. And sociologically, I can't help but think that fake food, and some of his other ideas about changing city life may actually improve the human condition, maybe even eliminate hunger and homelessness all together. Basically, Lovelock's goal is to communicate that drastic action is needed, and fast, and even then it will only give us a little extra time to completely change our lifestyles. One idea of this book is that even ""green"" thinkers are more worried about human needs than the needs of the Earth, and scientists have been cultured to be focused on the small picture, and more conservative in their ideas and what they push onto the public. And even in our best intentions, we often cause more harm than good. We all need to adapt a big picture vision of the living system of which we are a part or else the Earth is going to become a place unsuitable for human life. He offers a lot of ideas, some that have been developed but not implemented, and others that are still in the realm of science fiction, but may be realistic if adapted accordingly. Even though some of the ideas seem over the top, I strongly recommend this book for anyone (especially those in positions of power and ability to change) who wants to ""save the world"" or who considers themself ""green,"" ""organic,"" or an ""environmentalist.""

14,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794887-cwn-annwn-13,1,"I am a bit of a tree hugger but on the other hand its become blatantly obvious that the globalist scumbags who cause most of the environmental problems have co-opted much of the environmental movement. It totally makes sense that they would do this because those of us with a clue know how they always try to control both sides. I know that most of the major environmental activist groups recieve funding from people like Exxon, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, etc. If any of these groups can do some good they have my support but how can they be trusted when they are being financially propped up by the people that cause the problems to begin with?I am open minded on the subject but I think man made global warming is debatable. I've grown much more suspicious recently because of the leaked emails where the two scientists were discussing falsifying data to over dramaticize global warming. I'm more concerned with deforestation, chemicals in the food and oil spills because these are things that absolutely are undebatable.This guy Lovelock is obviously in the new world order camp of environmentalism. Its pretty strange the way he beats the mantra of man made global warming without weighing both sides of the argument but refers to the fears of nuclear energy as ""nonsensical hype"" even saying ""no harm done"" when referring to Three Mile Island and that only 25 people died after the Chernobyl accident then grudgingly admits that some people living in Belarus and the Ukraine may have lost several WEEKS of their life expectancy because of Chernobyl!Probably the most telling thing is Lovelock talks about how after Rachel Carsons Silent Spring came out exposing how DDT pesticide was killing people he talks glowingly of the reaction of ""Lord"" Victor Rothschild, one of whose corporations was one of the worlds biggest manufacturers of DDT. He talks of Rothschilds ""agonized"" reaction, painting a sympathetic picture of a prominent member of what is possibly world histories most evil family. That in itself lets me know who Lovelock is working for."
15,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178927-mason,4,"Lovelock might ramble and his ideas may sometimes seem strange or oddly biased, but he's always thought-provoking, and that's the main reason I like reading his books. Take this part about nuclear waste (and keep in mind he's a big proponent of nuclear power):""One of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive [waste:] is the richness of their wildlife.... Wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous, and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets.... The preference of wildlife for nuclear waste sites suggests that the best sites for its disposal are the tropical forests and other habitats in need of a reliable guardian against their destruction by hungry farmers and developers.""I've never heard of someone else argue that nuclear waste could help protect nature. Maybe you think it's loony, but it does make you think.His other great trait is his focus on the long term and the big picture, in a way that's compelling and even inspirational. It's all-too-easy to treat predictions for what will happen in 2100 as handwaving, since no one knows what the world will be like then. But when our current trajectory is set against the long history of mankind, starting with how we harnessed fire to clear forests, and we think about how much we've changed the planet, then it becomes clear that we are a powerful force, and we should make a choice about how to direct that power."
16,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10878707-david,1,"As much as I thoroughly enjoyed Lovelock's previous books, and respect his contribution to a better understanding of global biogeochemical cycles to say the least, I found his most recent Revenge of Gaia very disappointing. There's nothing wrong with the writing or the subjects he explores, but the conclusions he comes to and the opinions he holds, are to me the signs of an older scientist gone cynical and conservative, and who is clearly out of touch with much of the larger social and global debate concerning agricultural and energetic sustainability. I understand the point he makes about some of the overly emotional reaction concerning nuclear energy, and Lovelock does a good job of explaing the science behind it, but I think his arguments are a bit simplistic. His proposal for concentrated factory farms to leave more of earth's area over to nature is just plainly ridiculous, and shows Lovelock is not very savvy when it comes to sustainable food prodcution, which does him no credit unfortunately. Shame."
17,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28758128-adam-dolphin,4,"Some of the reviews of this book puzzle me. People are slating it because they're picking up on particular issues: he supports nuclear power (scandal!) or he presents an overly British perspective on things (he's an elderly British guy, who'd a thunk it!).The book is about the importance of having a holistic view of the world and how it works and how our neglect of this viewpoint is leading us to ruin and chaos. Criticising the author for his thoughts (he's allowed to have them and has earned the right given his background) on strands of his overall theory is wonderfully ironic. It's a fairly concise book that brings home the stark reality of the damage we're doing to planet Earth really well. There are plenty of interesting facts along the way and the author is a passionate advocate of changing how we live to safeguard our future.Why say it's a crap book because you disagree with his solutions? It's this kind of narrow minded attitude to others ideas that means we'll never come to the consensus needed to get out of this mess."
18,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3676563-jung,3,"It’s great to read a book written by someone with a scientific mind. The whole flow and timing of the words, the thoughts, are different. Stately, measured, calm. Reading such writing actually slows you down. I couldn’t rush through this book; it’s rhythm dictated mine; I couldn’t speed read and skip descriptive words and sentences like I do with non-fiction books. There was elegance. Makes a convincing argument for nuclear power. In the face of what might come which he sees as a threat to civilization as we know it, radiation risk seems minor. Besides he says we breathe oxygen which is a carcinogen every day.Ends with thoughts about a book that will hold the dark ages at bay, a reservoir of human knowledge so we won’t have to start again. Sobering shit. "
19,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019216-eric,4,"While Lovelock's Gaia Theory is still in my opinion flawed because he isn't careful enough to define what he means by Mother Earth having a goal, I do think that anyone wanting to understand life on earth as a big interconnected system would benefit from this relatively quick read. And read some of the references as well. I understand that you might be better served to read ""The Ages of Gaia"" than this, which I will."
20,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/840406-elisa,1,I completely agree with the Gaia theory; all things on earth are a part of one system and that there are checks and balances as the earth tries to keep things in check. But I was turned off by this book because the author/creator of Gaia theory thinks we need to use uranium to help ween ourselves off our nonrenewable energies. This idea bothered me so much that I couldn't finish the book and had to put it down. 
21,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9649054-stephen,3,"A conflicting read. I finished reading his first book Gaia yesterday and finished this one today.To me, the author makes a lot of sense in some areas, like the need to reduce our carbon emissions and the need to stop destroying natural resources that are integral to keeping our planet alive. In a similar tone to his first book, Gaia, he stresses how all life on this planet is connected and we somehow form a living world that is self regulating and alive. I’m glad to see that he has moved away from his original notion of being able to do almost anything we like to the world and somehow Gaia will balance things out.The author then laments governments stopping farmers using DDT pesticides and the re-introduction of manure based farming. For these areas, I believe the author is using a bottom-up view rather than a top down view, which he repeatedly stresses as the reason for others not understanding his Gaia theory. Yes, DDT may be useful for killing insects, but birds dying from ingesting DDT riddled insects are just one link in the food chain. A top down view of birds dying from DDT means considering the whole environment the birds live in, not just the birds themselves. What about the animals that eat the birds? What happens to the poison in the body of the birds? Will insects eating the dead bird ingest the DDT too? As far as the manure, the author complains about runoff flowing into streams and killing the fish and plants. Taking a top down view, the problem is farming animals in the first place. Methane is a green house gas and, as the author has stated, lasts in the atmosphere a lot longer than Carbon Dioxide. Yes, methane from farming is a lot less than CO2, but it’s going to be up there for longer. The top down view would be that intensive animal farming is causing the river to be killed off, not using too many cows to fertilise the land. With these issues, he’s looking at the small picture problems and remedies to treat the symptoms rather than how to fix the big picture problems.Rather than considering a whole grain plant based diet, the author would prefer to jump straight to synthesised food. Wind farms are apparently a bad idea because they make the view of his part of the countryside an eyesore and the only way to meet our energy needs is with nuclear power. I’d need to read more on nuclear power to be sure, I’m not necessarily against it and I’ve read that a lot of the anti-nuclear lobbies are funded by oil and gas companies, so there could be something there. I can see why people are fearful of nuclear power because of nuclear weapons. It makes sense and so would be a shame if it was a viable clean source of energy that we’re avoiding out of unwarranted fears.I think any scientist is going to run the risk of causing a stir when they mix well thought out theories and scientific facts with personal opinions and gripes. It’s a shame that this otherwise great book has been mixed in with what seems to be not very well thought out personal views."
22,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50098084-johanna-hilla,4,"Yet another discovery in a bookshelf of a person who I was staying with. I recently finished reading Lovelocke's later book 'Novacene', which he published at the age of 91. (This one he wrote up at the age of 86!) if something has to be said for James Lovelocke, it is that the love for his work and his concern for the planetary future are tangibly felt in both of these pieces. While Novacene felt at times more like science fiction than seriously weighable writings of a scientist, for me, the Revenge of Gaia was a very convincing and touching book. Together with Lynn Margulis, James Lovelock is best known as the founder of the 'Gaia Hypothesis'. The premise of Gaia is the earth is a single living organism, with a desire to retain equilibrium that humans are currently severely damaging. Without venturing into too much New-Age sentimentalism, Lovelock demonstrates through his scientific understanding of the fragile and complex state of the earth. His main argument is that even if the earth would have previously been able to respond in a resilient manner to human doings, the earth is very old, and therefore takes far longer time to recuperate from our actions.Lovelock presents a convincing, today not a very novel argument for why we have to stop the use of fossil fuels immediately and to change to nuclear energy. Prior to reading this book, I had updated myself embarrassingly little about renewable energy sources, all of which Lovelock declares as either too inefficient or too costly. Especially, he warns against the use of biofuels, hence their impact through increasing use of landmass is a serious hazard.Informative, and a touching read for anyone interested in the scientific understanding of our mother Gaia. I am grateful that James Lovelock is still a voice among us, and that he has had the energy to share his important message until this day."
23,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33349288-andrew-clover,5,"'I am not recommending nuclear fission energy as the long term panacea for our ailing planet. I see it as the only effective medicine we have now.' That is one of the immediately salient messages from this clear, enlivening book. I read it, because I had long heard about 'Gaia Theory' which sounded like some nonsense hippy wishful thinking: the notion that the earth is alive and monitoring her interests. Then I read the book and found Gaia is a scientifically proven metaphor. I also learned much else... Lovelock writes simply, and addresses the needs of the planet as a whole. You feel as if - up to now - you've been looking at the stones; now you're seeing the whole of the planet, from space, and simply, with someone who can educate you fast what you need to know. And it's incredible when you start to consider it... We're probably about 30 years from having 500 ppm of carbon dioxide. At that point the ice caps will melt, over-heating will accelerate, seas will rise... From there, we're only a few years from a ruined world of deserts ruled by warlords... Meanwhile we're arguing about Brexit... What could we do? Nuclear fission is the easiest medicine. Read Monbiot on the subject. Did you know that since Fukushima, no one has died from radiation? Meanwhile the world is definitely heating... Read this book. Start cycling, wear jumpers, and start lobbying for nuclear energy."
24,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,5,"I highly recommend this book. It is a very clear-headed and rational look at the problem of climate change and what we can realistically do about it. Since I was unfamiliar with Lovelock and his Gaia hypothesis, I was half-expecting this to be some ""New Age"", spiritual, totally unhelpful look at climate change, but I was pleasantly surprised. Lovelock is a very serious scientist, Gaia is a useful metaphor for the whole-earth biosphere (not some modern goddess), and there are many ideas here that policy-makers and the general public should know about. For instance, unlike many green activists, the author is a proponent of nuclear energy and rails against the ineffectiveness of green sources like wind and hydro power that are peddled by politicians who actually have no understanding of the problem at hand. Lovelock's example is the Yangtze Dam in China - if the dam were to break, potentially millions would be killed, whereas the worst nuclear disaster in history at Chernobyl killed less than a 100 people (and not instantly, as he points out, but years later from cancer). This is not even to mention the dangers of working with fossil fuels. These risks of course pale in comparison to what we are already doing with our energy production (i.e., potentially dooming humanity to extinction). All in all, this was a great book, though possibly a bit outdated as it was published in 2006."

However, he is not a sociologist and he's almost 100 years old so if you pay little attention to the opinions that are attached to the social issues he raises, this book is magical. The book often touches on some heavily depressing facts that weighed my heart down at times and sheds light on how destructive we as a human species have become. It's like being smacked in the face after being so ignorant and careless about something so so important. I had to put the book down for a bit because of how sad it was, and how we have done deep, irreversible damage to Gaia. Thanks to this book I have become more motivated and dedicated to doing my bit to heal Gaia, even if it is too late. She is a self-regulating ecosystem that sadly, will destroy us if we try to destroy her. "

But globally, I found the book lacking of unity, the same information is written more than once here and there, sometimes the author seems focused mostly on the status of the countryside he lives in (he admits he can sound like a ""nimby""), the scientific basis of a couple of thesis are not well explained (again, the radiations effects on human health, or the amount of the change in the atmospheric composition caused by living beings, for example). One note at the end of the book claims that the Gaia theory advanced ten hypothesis that were afterwards confirmed, but there isn't even the simple list of these hypothesis. "

As excited as the idea might be, The Revenge of Gaia takes its reader on a sad journey, describing human blindness and greed, the decay of the current natural equilibrium and the fall of all habitats as we known them. The book is not just a depressive rant on how much we've messed up as a species. Lovelock goes into great detail trying to find possible sustainable solutions concerning our need for energy and consumption. Not a good book if you're currently feeling down.Otherwise, highly recommended, well-written piece of theory on what is yet to come."

38,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,3,"I was vaguely aware of James Lovelock as one of the developers of the Gaia hypothesis, something I thought was cool but didn't know much about in action. At the end of our case study in climate change politics, my Global Environmental Politics professor showed us this video of James Lovelock speaking about his more recent book, the Vanishing Face of Gaia: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRQ-Nq...In the video, Lovelock comes off as an eminently reasonable but quite cantankerous old British scientist, with all the charm that implies. His ideas, however, are extremely sensationalized (note the APOCALYPSE banner in the background), and I was curious to both spend more time with this charming old man and to see what his ideas were really like. James Lovelock's perspective is similar to that of Derrick Jensen in many ways, though the men and their personalities are vastly different. Both decry the mainstream environmentalist movement that tells us we can save the planet if we just change our lifestyles, or that ""sustainable development"" is a panacea that will allow us to have and eat our cake (the Earth). Lovelock goes even further, criticizing the environmental movement viciously for two crimes: putting human concerns in the short term over the long-term health of the planet (which is, of course, ironic) and for doing more harm than good in their lobbying for changed policies. He cites in the first case the irrational fear of nuclear energy that the green movement is championing, which prevents us from switching over much of our grid to nuclear as a way to quickly and feasibly reduce CO2 emissions. This makes sense to me. As a pragmatist, I understand that we aren't going to undergo a voluntary transition away from the over-energetic society of today. This means that in order to get off fossil fuels immediately, we need to implement all of the large-scale replacements we can. Nuclear has some disadvantages, of course, and plenty more than Lovelock believes it has, but they pale in comparison with accelerated climate change. In the latter example, I was quite a bit less convinced. For example, he argues that the banning of DDT by cancer-paranoid Westerners was a crime against the malaria-ridden third-world. This may have an element of truth to it, but it ignores the fact that pesticides are a Sisyphean, not cost-effective method of reducing pests that also happens to poison the environment.The differences are also striking, however. Lovelock is in every sense a civilizationist. He loves the boons of civilization, and thinks it has done great things (on a philosophical level) for Gaia (seeing herself from space, etc). Jensen thinks civilizations as he defines them are not merely unsustainable but inherently undesirable, for the oppression and class division they seem to breed inherently. Lovelock never espouses in this book the doomsday recklessness he is supposed to in that interview. He suggests that we may have passed the climate tipping point, but not that we already have, and in any case says that regardless, it is still in our interests to drastically reduce emissions at the same time as we prepare for the now-inevitable consequences of the GHGs we have released already. He is suggested what he calls a ""powered landing,"" in which we use the resources of technology to carefully and intentionally reduce civilization to a sustainable, 1 billion member level. This is, again, similar to what Jensen argues, except that Jensen seeks ""primitivism."" Lovelock has an interesting perspective and an interesting personality, and it's far more realistic and credible than those of most environmentalists. His thesis is that the way humans are living today is disastrous for the Earth and its self-regulation regime, and that by fussing with it we are moving towards a new permanent hot state. He acknowledges that we have already set the ball rolling on this, and that it would be nearly impossible for us to hold it back now. We have failed to develop a land ethic, and our decisions are still motivated by profit and comfort in the short term. "
39,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50787536-pearl-gray,3,"I'm not a scientist, but I follow a few science writers. What I appreciated about Lovelock's ideas in this book is that he prefaces them with the statement that science is probability, never certainty. I agree. The biosphere is a very complex phenomenon. In his book, Lovelock states his Gaia theory: the planet and biosphere responds to what is asked of it. We are currently asking it to feed almost 8 billion of us. The rising heat and other related factors are creating more biomass. This is good except the Lovelock states that the sun, too, is heating up. It's possible that all of humanity will have to move to the temperate zones and arctic regions to survive. Lovelock would be happier if the were one billion of us...so would I. That's not likely to happen, so Lovelock gives us his very studied view of the alternatives we have for survival, that is, if Gaia does not just keep giving us what we need. It's worth the read to learn what he thinks we can do about this crisis, if there is one. "
40,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4003411-ld,2,"First off, I didn't complete this book. Gaia is the idea of the Earth as an aggregate life form and in this book Lovelock presents that life form's physiological data. The tone of the information is academic and presented under the assumption that you have a decent understanding of global warming, geology, and biology. Essentially, if you have a college degree you should be able to absorb the essence of the information provided, but without a broad education of natural sciences you will likely have a hard time. I didn't complete the book mainly because the information presented supports the theory that sustainability and alternative power sources are moot points. Overpopulation, methane and CO2 levels, deforestation, industrialization etc. have exceeded the point at which any beneficial change can stop the destruction of Gaia/Earth. After getting through 1/3 of this book, my apathy became overwhelming; I can't make a difference, so why bother finishing this book. "
41,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873780-michael,4,"This is one scary book. Lovelock is a highly influential thinker and has revolutionized our understanding of earth-life systems. Although initially dismissed his theories are now widely accepted. This book is an unflinching look at the future we are headed towards and joins the increasing chorus calling for increased attention to averting climate change as our greatest priority. It may already be too late to avoid many of the consequences that are already coming our way so we will also have to adapt. Lovelock poses a powerful argument for turning to nuclear power who risks are much lower than the risks of ongoing fossil fuel use and suggests that alternate ""renewable"" energy sources are not yet ready to make a difference or pose hidden counterproductive effects.We seem to be asleep as we head for the fall and the potential consequences are mind boggling."

In this work he focuses on explaining and detailing the latest science on global warming and, unfortuately, begins to sound like the Prophet Jerimiah in his stridency. I happen to have been an early adopter of the concerns about global warming, the permutations of which are beyond our imagination. I know not how to actively address this issue publicly or what I can do to protect my granddaughter's world. Maybe we do need a modern day prophet to wander out of the desert and begin shouting in a manner to which people will listen. There are better books on the subject but this is worth read out of respect for its author."
43,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7171718-victoria-benstead-hume,1,"I am so glad to be through with this book. I like the concept, I liked the subject matter. I didn't like the illogical rambling arguments that seemed to have no destination but seemed to be more like personal rants and prejudices than anything resembling scientific reasoning. And what was with all that name dropping, no Mr Lovelock, I don't care that you're friends with William Golding and it's his fault that your theory sounds like a strange cult.Also, anyone who suggests dumping nuclear waste in pristine rain forests 'for their protection' should really get out in the real world more, and learn a bit about ecology."
44,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12446595-robin,2,"I don't really know what to think. His observations and scientific points are right and important to make. Climate change is serious. We need to be prepared for huge and mainly disastrous changes in our and our childrens lives if we don't act quickly.But then there is Lovelock himself. His idiosyncratic beliefs, his self-promoting anecdotes and peculiar set of solutions. In the end I don't know whether he cares about humans at all. One billion of them is already too much, he says, and reveals a profound lack of faith in human ingenuity (that is, in nature itself). This is self-defeating. Maybe he is just one of the one billion misanthropes living on the western hemisphere of Gaia."
45,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9464983-karthikeyan-iyer,4,"There are some surprises in the narrative. That the human race has done and is doing damage to its chances to survive on Planet Earth is well known. That Earth is a living system is also increasingly accepted and acknowledged. However, two points stood out for me as novel and thought provoking. One, the damage we are doing could be irreversible and could lead to Earth becoming a dead planet. Two, our understanding of what is harmful and whats not could be turned on its head e.g. are chemicals the villains of piece and organics the heroes? Are we missing the forests for the trees? Counter intuitive."
46,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867581-kelda,1,"A friend recommended I read a gaia/lovelock book, but I don't think it was this one!!How could any sane person say that the only way out of the climate crisis is for clean nuclear and an end to growing food? (Really, he says we should instead eat food-like substances made in factories). I don't know...Lots of electricity is not a prerequisite to a civilization, you doof. (see 1491 book review). and food has been feeding people in productive non-monoculture ways that help the planet for most of our existence.I stopped reading it after the first few chapters. Better things to do..."
47,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1247962-nik,2,"Maybe the first book was great, but this one, is flawed. Lovelock would willing build his house over a nuclear waste area, this is nonsense really, and it does not win my vote for nuclear proliferation. Here is a challenge to Lovelock, Britain would rather spend 6billion dollars on a few nuclear powered submarines, than installed solar energy panels to provide electricity to the whole of England! Now that is nonsense."
48,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349441-ian-russell,5,"Clarity of thought from a rare and great independent thinker of our time. Good arguments, if sometimes unorthodox - certainly not compliant mindset mainstream - backed up with plenty of references. It has the potential to alarm the reader, and it probably won't succeed unless it does, yet despite this, Lovelock remains ever reasonable, lucid and pragmatic - and often charming; enjoy him while you can. "
49,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802791-ross,4,"James Lovelock, the independent British scientist who formulated the Gaia theory, takes a look at what a warmer world will bring. His projection is plausible, and one of the darkest and most pessimistic yet floated by a major scientist. Makes a Green willing to embrace Lovelock's preferred solution, nuclear energy."
50,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2247063-theresa,5,"I am really enjoying this book so far. Even though I have to re-read paragraphs 2 or 3 times sometimes to make sure I understand it! It really makes me want to read more on the subject. Even though I'm only on chapter 2, I highly recommend this book to everyone. Except you wierdo's who think it's all a conspiracy. ---- I finished the book. So sad for poor earth. "
51,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2535912-james-axtell,5,"I found that this thesis took a while to get into. As Lovelock admits the argument that the Earth is a ""living organism"" leads one to read with some skepticism. However, it is worth persevering and the essence of what he means by it is both clear and chilling in its implications for us and the planet."
52,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3085589-jason,4,"I can understand Lovelock's case for nuclear power as a way to ease humanity off its fossil fuel addiction, but for me his argument lacks depth because he does not explore the drivers of humanity's ever-increasing desire to exploit natural resources. i.e. nuclear power might actually increase our desire for energy, not reduce it."
53,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901371-rob,3,Hmmmm. Any discussion about climate change is good. I wanted to hear Lovelock's arguments about nuclear energy being good for the planet. Not convinced however.Overall the book is a bit rambling although a valuable insight into the biosphere/gaia's response to global warming. Very pessimistic which I can't fault him for.
54,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9008218-cliff,5,"James Lovelock is 100% right about his predictions and analysis based on empirical data regarding Climate Change. The planet is alive and humans have upset the delicate balance so massively that its just a short amount of time (relatively speaking), before the majority of the human race is wiped out from floods, drought, extreme weather, etc."
55,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5716847-marion-husband,5,"This is a very scary book, one that everyone should read....but perhaps not, as it does make you feel as though there is very little we can do to stop the rot. It will make you rethink your views however if you are very pro wind farms and anti nuclear power, it seems to me that there are a lot of myths surrounding 'green' issues today (such as wind power). "
56,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15573757-salman,5,"The Gaia theory is not just a theory, but a scientific reality as the planet we live in is sustained and enriched by the interaction of living and non-living entities within an ecosystem e.g all the oxygen that we birth today was produced by the Stromatolites. This oxygen has helped sustained life and bolstered evolution of life as we know!"
57,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1675935-inma,5,Fantastic book that will help you to understand the issues of global warming and why is not just a question of temperatures rising but a combination of factors. All those factors together represent a very dangerous and real risk not only for humans but also for the whole planet
58,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306661-chandra,5,"I would recommend this book to anybody who is concerned about the way humans are using earth. I agree with the author when he says that earth will become inhabitable if we don't stop our pillaging of its resources in the name of ""progress"". Humanity will survive but not the civilization."
59,046504168X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2166263-manoj-kumar,3,"Interesting theory about the earth (like a human body) has a self-regulating system to control it's temperature. What it is currently is going through is not unlike a fever that lasts 100,000 years during which period it will shake off whatever is causing the fever (in this case humans)."
